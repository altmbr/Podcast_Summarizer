[00:00:00] I will never forget when I first met Gavin Baker,
[00:00:03] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: who was early days of the podcast,
[00:00:04] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: and he was one of the first people I talked to about markets
[00:00:07] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: outside of my area of expertise,
[00:00:09] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: which at the time was quantitative investing
[00:00:11] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: about the incredible passionate experience
[00:00:14] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: that he's had investing in technology across his career.
[00:00:17] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I find his interest in markets, his curiosity about the world,
[00:00:21] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: to be about as infectious as any investor
[00:00:23] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: that I've ever come across.
[00:00:24] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: He is encyclopedic on what is going on in the world of technology today.
[00:00:28] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And I've had the good fortune to host him every year or two
[00:00:31] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: since that first meeting on this podcast.
[00:00:34] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: In this latest conversation,
[00:00:35] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: we talk about everything that interests Gavin.
[00:00:37] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: We talk about Nvidia, Google, and its TPUs,
[00:00:40] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: the changing AI landscape, the changing math
[00:00:43] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: and business models around AI companies.
[00:00:45] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: This is a life or death decision.
[00:00:47] Gavin Baker: It essentially, every what except Microsoft is failure.
[00:00:51] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: We even discussed the crazy idea of data centers in space,
[00:00:55] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: which he communicates with his usual passion and logic.
[00:00:58] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: In every way, data centers in space
[00:01:01] Gavin Baker: from a first principles perspective are superior to data centers on Earth.
[00:01:06] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Because Gavin is one of the most passionate thinkers and investors
[00:01:10] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: that I know, these conversations are always amongst my most favorite,
[00:01:13] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I hope you enjoy this latest and series of discussions with Gavin Baker.
[00:01:19] I would love to talk about how you,
[00:01:22] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: like in the nitty-gritty process,
[00:01:24] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: new things that come out in this whole AI world
[00:01:27] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: because it's happening so constantly.
[00:01:29] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I'm extremely interested in it and I find it very hard to keep up.
[00:01:31] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And I have a couple blogs that I go read and friends that I call.
[00:01:35] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: But maybe let's take Gemini three years, like a recent example.
[00:01:38] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: When that comes out, what literally take me into your office,
[00:01:41] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: like what are you doing?
[00:01:43] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: How do you and your team process an update like that
[00:01:46] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: given how often these things are happening?
[00:01:48] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I mean, I think the first thing is you have to use it yourself.
[00:01:50] Gavin Baker: Yeah.
[00:01:51] Gavin Baker: And I would just say I'm amazed at how many famous and August investors
[00:01:55] Gavin Baker: are reaching really definitive conclusions about using it.
[00:01:59] Gavin Baker: When they're based on the free tier,
[00:02:01] Gavin Baker: the free tier is like you're dealing with the tin year olds.
[00:02:04] Gavin Baker: And you're making conclusions about the tin year olds,
[00:02:07] Gavin Baker: capabilities as an adult.
[00:02:09] Gavin Baker: And you could just pay, and I do think,
[00:02:11] Gavin Baker: actually, you do need to pay for the highest tier,
[00:02:13] Gavin Baker: whether it's Gemini Ultra, SuperGrock, whatever it is,
[00:02:16] Gavin Baker: you have to pay the $200 per month tiers.
[00:02:19] Gavin Baker: Whereas those are like a fully fledged 30, 35 year old,
[00:02:23] Gavin Baker: it's really hard to extrapolate from a native or a 10 year old
[00:02:25] Gavin Baker: to the 35 year old, and yet a lot of people are doing that.
[00:02:28] Gavin Baker: And the second thing is, there was an insider post about OpenAI,
[00:02:31] Gavin Baker: and they said to a large degree OpenAI runs on Twitter Vops.
[00:02:36] Gavin Baker: And I just think AI happens on X.
[00:02:41] Gavin Baker: And there have been some really memorable moments,
[00:02:44] Gavin Baker: like there was a giant fight between the PyTorch team at Meta
[00:02:48] Gavin Baker: and the Jack's team at Google, on X.
[00:02:52] Gavin Baker: And the leaders of each lab had to step in publicly say,
[00:02:57] no one from my lab is allowed to say bad things about the other lab,
[00:03:00] Gavin Baker: and I respect them, and that is the end of that.
[00:03:03] Gavin Baker: The companies are all commenting on each other's posts,
[00:03:06] Gavin Baker: the research papers come out.
[00:03:08] Gavin Baker: On planet Earth, there's 500 to 1,000 people
[00:03:11] Gavin Baker: who really, really understand this and are at the cutting edge of it.
[00:03:15] And a good number of them live in China.
[00:03:19] Gavin Baker: I just think you have to follow those people closely.
[00:03:21] Gavin Baker: And I think there is incredible signal.
[00:03:24] Gavin Baker: To me, everything in AI is just downstream of those people.
[00:03:29] Gavin Baker: Yeah.
[00:03:29] Gavin Baker: Everything Andre Carpathi writes, you have to read it three times.
[00:03:32] Gavin Baker: Yeah.
[00:03:33] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Minimum.
[00:03:33] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, he's incredible.
[00:03:34] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And then I would say, anytime one of those labs,
[00:03:38] Gavin Baker: the four labs that matter, being OpenAI, Jim and I,
[00:03:41] Gavin Baker: I'd drop a Connect AI, which are clearly the four leading labs.
[00:03:44] Gavin Baker: Like anytime somebody from one of those labs goes on a podcast,
[00:03:48] Gavin Baker: I just think it's so important to listen.
[00:03:51] And then for me, one of the best use cases of AI
[00:03:55] Gavin Baker: is to keep up with all of this.
[00:03:58] Gavin Baker: Just like, listen to a podcast.
[00:04:00] Gavin Baker: And then if there are parts that I thought were interesting,
[00:04:03] Gavin Baker: just talk about it with AI.
[00:04:05] Gavin Baker: And I think it's really important to have
[00:04:06] Gavin Baker: as little friction as possible.
[00:04:07] Gavin Baker: I'll bring it up.
[00:04:08] Gavin Baker: I have it like I can either press this button and pull up
[00:04:14] Gavin Baker: rock, or I have this.
[00:04:15] Gavin Baker: Oh, wow.
[00:04:16] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I don't know.
[00:04:16] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I don't know.
[00:04:16] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: That just brings it right up.
[00:04:17] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, it brings it right up.
[00:04:19] Gavin Baker: What do you think of Patrick O'Shaughnessy?
[00:04:21] Gavin Baker: Oh, man.
[00:04:22] Unknown Guest: Patrick O'Shaughnessy is one of my favorite voices in investing.
[00:04:26] Unknown Guest: His invest like the best podcast is Straight Fire.
[00:04:29] Unknown Guest: Does Pete Dives with folks like Bill Garley virtual?
[00:04:32] Unknown Guest: Garley, yes.
[00:04:34] It's so amazing.
[00:04:35] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Do you believe we have this?
[00:04:37] Gavin Baker: I know.
[00:04:37] Gavin Baker: It's like, yeah, I think somebody said on X, you know,
[00:04:42] Gavin Baker: like we imbued these rocks with crazy spells.
[00:04:48] Gavin Baker: And now we can sub in super intelligent genies
[00:04:52] on our phones over the air.
[00:04:54] Gavin Baker: You know, it's crazy.
[00:04:55] Gavin Baker: Crazy.
[00:04:56] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: So something like Gemini come three comes out.
[00:04:58] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: You know, the public interpretation was,
[00:05:00] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: oh, this is interesting.
[00:05:01] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: It seems to say something about scaling laws
[00:05:03] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: and the pre-training stuff.
[00:05:05] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: What is your frame on like the state of prog general progress
[00:05:08] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: in frontier models in general?
[00:05:10] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Like, what are you watching most closely?
[00:05:12] Gavin Baker: Yeah.
[00:05:12] Gavin Baker: Well, I do think Gemini 3 was very important
[00:05:14] Gavin Baker: because it showed us that scaling laws
[00:05:16] Gavin Baker: for pre-training are intact.
[00:05:18] Gavin Baker: They, you know, stated that unequivocally.
[00:05:20] Gavin Baker: And that's important because no one on planet Earth
[00:05:23] Gavin Baker: knows how or why scaling laws for pre-training work.
[00:05:26] Gavin Baker: It's actually not a law.
[00:05:28] Gavin Baker: It's an empirical observation.
[00:05:29] Gavin Baker: And it's an empirical observation
[00:05:31] Gavin Baker: that we've measured extremely precisely
[00:05:33] Gavin Baker: in its held for a long time.
[00:05:34] Gavin Baker: But our understanding of scaling laws for pre-training,
[00:05:37] Gavin Baker: and maybe this is a little bit controversial,
[00:05:38] Gavin Baker: 20% of researchers are probably not more than that.
[00:05:41] Gavin Baker: It's kind of like the ancient British people's understanding
[00:05:44] Gavin Baker: of the sun.
[00:05:44] Gavin Baker: Are the ancient Egyptians understanding the sun?
[00:05:47] Gavin Baker: They can measure it so precisely
[00:05:49] Gavin Baker: that the east-west axis of the Great Pyramids
[00:05:51] Gavin Baker: are perfectly aligned with the Equinoxes.
[00:05:53] Gavin Baker: And so are the east-west axis of Stonehenge.
[00:05:56] Perfect measurement.
[00:05:58] Gavin Baker: But they had no idea how or why, you know,
[00:06:04] Gavin Baker: it rose in the east, set in the west,
[00:06:07] Gavin Baker: and you know, kind of moved across the horizon.
[00:06:09] Gavin Baker: This is the aliens.
[00:06:09] Gavin Baker: Yeah.
[00:06:10] Gavin Baker: Our god in a chariot.
[00:06:12] Gavin Baker: And so it's really important every time
[00:06:14] Gavin Baker: we get a confirmation of that.
[00:06:17] Gavin Baker: So Jim and I-3 was very important in that way.
[00:06:19] Gavin Baker: But I think there's been a big misunderstanding,
[00:06:21] Gavin Baker: maybe in the public equity investing community
[00:06:23] Gavin Baker: or the broader, more generalist community.
[00:06:26] Based on the scaling laws of pre-training,
[00:06:28] Gavin Baker: there really should have been no progress in 24 and 25.
[00:06:32] Gavin Baker: And the reason for that is, you know, after XAI figured out
[00:06:36] Gavin Baker: how to get 200,000 hoppers coherent,
[00:06:40] you had to wait for the next generation of chips.
[00:06:43] Because you really can't get more than 200,000 hoppers coherent.
[00:06:46] Gavin Baker: And coherent just means you can just think of it as HGPU,
[00:06:49] Gavin Baker: knows what every other GPU is thinking.
[00:06:50] Gavin Baker: They kind of are sharing memory.
[00:06:52] Gavin Baker: They're connected.
[00:06:52] Gavin Baker: They scale up networks and scale out.
[00:06:55] Gavin Baker: And they have to be coherent during the pre-training process.
[00:06:59] Gavin Baker: And I think there's a lot of misunderstanding
[00:07:01] Gavin Baker: about Jim and I-3 that I think is really important.
[00:07:03] Gavin Baker: So everything in AI has a struggle between Google and Nvidia.
[00:07:07] And Google has the TPU.
[00:07:09] Gavin Baker: And Nvidia has their GPUs.
[00:07:11] Gavin Baker: And each of, I mean, Google only has a TPU.
[00:07:13] Gavin Baker: And they use a bunch of other chips for networking.
[00:07:15] Gavin Baker: Nvidia has the full stack.
[00:07:16] Gavin Baker: And Blackwell was delayed.
[00:07:19] Gavin Baker: Blackwell was Nvidia's next generation chip.
[00:07:21] Gavin Baker: And the first iteration of that was the Blackwell 200.
[00:07:26] Gavin Baker: A lot of different skews were canceled.
[00:07:28] Gavin Baker: And the reason for that is, it was by far
[00:07:31] Gavin Baker: the most complex product transition we've ever
[00:07:33] Gavin Baker: gone through in technology.
[00:07:35] Gavin Baker: Going from hopper to Blackwell,
[00:07:37] Gavin Baker: first you go from air cooled to liquid cooled.
[00:07:40] Gavin Baker: The rack goes from weighing round numbers of 1,000 pounds
[00:07:43] Gavin Baker: to 3,000 pounds.
[00:07:45] Gavin Baker: Goes from round numbers 30 kilowatts,
[00:07:47] Gavin Baker: which is 30 American homes, 230 kilowatts,
[00:07:49] Gavin Baker: which is 130 American homes.
[00:07:51] Gavin Baker: So I analogize it to imagine if to get a new iPhone,
[00:07:55] Gavin Baker: you had to change all the outlets in your house to 220 volts,
[00:08:00] put in a Tesla power wall, put in a generator,
[00:08:04] Gavin Baker: put in solar panels, that's the power,
[00:08:06] Gavin Baker: put in a whole home humidification system,
[00:08:09] Gavin Baker: and then reinforce the floor,
[00:08:11] Gavin Baker: because the floor can't handle this.
[00:08:14] Gavin Baker: So it was a huge product transition.
[00:08:16] Gavin Baker: And then just the rack was so dense,
[00:08:18] Gavin Baker: it was really hard for them to get the heat out.
[00:08:21] Gavin Baker: So Blackwells have only really started to be deployed
[00:08:26] Gavin Baker: and really scaled deployments over the last three or four months.
[00:08:30] Gavin Baker: Had reasoning not come along,
[00:08:33] Gavin Baker: there would have been no AI progress
[00:08:37] from mid-2024 through essentially Ghibli 3.
[00:08:42] Gavin Baker: There would have been none.
[00:08:44] Everything would have stalled.
[00:08:46] Gavin Baker: And you could imagine what that would have meant to the markets.
[00:08:48] Gavin Baker: Like for sure, we would have lived in a very different environment.
[00:08:52] Gavin Baker: So reasoning kind of bridged this like 18 month gap,
[00:08:56] Gavin Baker: reasoning kind of saved AI,
[00:08:58] Gavin Baker: because it let AI make progress without Blackwell
[00:09:03] Gavin Baker: or the next generation of TPU, which were necessary
[00:09:06] Gavin Baker: for the scaling laws for pre-trading to continue.
[00:09:08] Gavin Baker: The reason we've had all this progress,
[00:09:11] Gavin Baker: maybe we could show like the ARC, AGI slide,
[00:09:14] Gavin Baker: where you went from zero to eight over four years,
[00:09:18] Gavin Baker: you were to eight percent intelligence,
[00:09:20] Gavin Baker: and then you went from eight percent to 95 percent
[00:09:22] Gavin Baker: in three months when the first reasoning model came out
[00:09:25] Gavin Baker: from OpenAI, is we have these two new scaling laws
[00:09:28] Gavin Baker: of post-training, which is just reinforcement learning
[00:09:30] Gavin Baker: with verified rewards.
[00:09:32] Gavin Baker: Verified is such an important concept in AI.
[00:09:35] Gavin Baker: Like one of Carpathi's great things was with software.
[00:09:38] Gavin Baker: Anything you can specify, you can automate.
[00:09:41] With AI, anything you can verify, you can automate.
[00:09:44] Gavin Baker: It's such an important concept,
[00:09:45] Gavin Baker: and I think it's an important distinction.
[00:09:46] Gavin Baker: And then test time compute.
[00:09:48] Gavin Baker: And so all the progress we've had,
[00:09:50] Gavin Baker: we've had a mince progress since October 24th through today,
[00:09:55] was based entirely on these two new scaling laws.
[00:09:58] Gavin Baker: And Jim and I three was arguably the first test
[00:10:01] Gavin Baker: since Hopper came out of the scaling law for pre-training.
[00:10:06] Gavin Baker: And it held, and that's great,
[00:10:07] Gavin Baker: because all these scaling laws are multiplicative,
[00:10:10] Gavin Baker: so now we're going to apply these two new reinforcement
[00:10:15] Gavin Baker: learning, the verified rewards and test time compute
[00:10:18] Gavin Baker: to much better base models.
[00:10:21] Gavin Baker: Google came out with the TPUV6 in 2024,
[00:10:24] Gavin Baker: and the TPUV7 in 2025.
[00:10:27] Gavin Baker: And in Simi conductor time,
[00:10:30] Gavin Baker: it's like almost like Imagine Hopper is like,
[00:10:34] Gavin Baker: it's like a World War II airplane.
[00:10:37] Gavin Baker: And it was by far the best World War II airplane.
[00:10:39] Gavin Baker: It's P51 Mustang with the Merlin engine.
[00:10:42] Gavin Baker: And two years later, in Simi conductor time,
[00:10:44] Gavin Baker: that's like, you know, you're an F4 Phantom, okay?
[00:10:49] Gavin Baker: Because Blackwell was such a complicated product
[00:10:51] Gavin Baker: and so hard to ramp, Google was training Jim and I three
[00:10:55] Gavin Baker: on 24 and 25-era TPUs, which are like F4 Phantoms,
[00:10:59] Gavin Baker: like Blackwell, it's like an F35.
[00:11:02] Gavin Baker: It just took, we're really long time to get it going.
[00:11:06] So I think, you know, Google for sure,
[00:11:08] Gavin Baker: has this temporary advantage right now,
[00:11:10] Gavin Baker: from pre-training perspective.
[00:11:13] I think it's also important that they've been
[00:11:15] Gavin Baker: the lowest cost producer of tokens, okay?
[00:11:19] And this is really important because AI's the first time
[00:11:23] Gavin Baker: in my career as a tech investor
[00:11:24] Gavin Baker: that being the low cost producers ever mattered.
[00:11:26] Gavin Baker: Apple is not worth trillions
[00:11:28] Gavin Baker: because they're low cost producer of phones.
[00:11:30] Gavin Baker: Microsoft is not worth trillions
[00:11:32] Gavin Baker: because they're low cost producer of software.
[00:11:34] Gavin Baker: And video's not worth trillions
[00:11:35] Gavin Baker: because they're the low cost producer of AI accelerators.
[00:11:37] Gavin Baker: It's never mattered.
[00:11:39] Gavin Baker: And this is really important because what Google has been doing
[00:11:42] Gavin Baker: has the low cost producer as they have been,
[00:11:45] Gavin Baker: I would say, sucking the economic oxygen out
[00:11:48] Gavin Baker: of the AI ecosystem, which is an extremely rational strategy
[00:11:51] Gavin Baker: for them.
[00:11:53] And for anyone is the low cost producer, you know,
[00:11:55] Gavin Baker: let's just, let's make life really hard for our competitors.
[00:12:01] Gavin Baker: And so what happens now,
[00:12:04] Gavin Baker: I think it says pretty profound implications.
[00:12:06] Gavin Baker: One, we will see the first models trained on Blackwell
[00:12:09] Gavin Baker: in early 2026.
[00:12:11] Gavin Baker: I think the first Blackwell model will come from XAI.
[00:12:14] Gavin Baker: And the reason for that is just,
[00:12:16] Gavin Baker: it's a, according to Jensen,
[00:12:18] Gavin Baker: no one builds data centers faster than Elon.
[00:12:20] Gavin Baker: Jensen has said this on the record.
[00:12:22] Gavin Baker: Even once you have the Blackwells,
[00:12:24] Gavin Baker: it takes six to nine months to get them performing
[00:12:28] Gavin Baker: at the level of hopper.
[00:12:30] Because the hopper is finally tuned.
[00:12:32] Gavin Baker: Everybody knows how to use it.
[00:12:33] Gavin Baker: The software is perfect for it.
[00:12:34] Gavin Baker: The engineers know all it's quirks.
[00:12:36] Gavin Baker: You know, everybody knows how to architect a hopper data
[00:12:39] Gavin Baker: service point.
[00:12:40] Gavin Baker: And by the way, when hopper came out,
[00:12:42] Gavin Baker: it took six to 12 months for it to really outperform
[00:12:44] Gavin Baker: Ampere, which was generation before.
[00:12:47] Gavin Baker: So if you're Jensen or Ampere,
[00:12:48] Gavin Baker: you need to get, has many GPUs deployed
[00:12:52] Gavin Baker: in one data center as fast as possible
[00:12:54] Gavin Baker: in a coherent cluster, so you can work out the bugs.
[00:12:57] Gavin Baker: And so this is what XAI effectively does for Nvidia.
[00:13:00] Gavin Baker: Because they build the data centers the fastest.
[00:13:02] Gavin Baker: They can deploy Blackwells at scale the fastest,
[00:13:05] Gavin Baker: and they can help work with Nvidia
[00:13:08] Gavin Baker: to work out the bugs for everyone else.
[00:13:10] Gavin Baker: So because they're the fastest,
[00:13:12] Gavin Baker: they will, they'll have the first Blackwell model.
[00:13:15] We know that scaling loss for pre-training are intact.
[00:13:18] Gavin Baker: And this means the Blackwell model
[00:13:19] Gavin Baker: is going to be amazing.
[00:13:21] Gavin Baker: Blackwell is, I mean, it's not enough for 35,
[00:13:24] Gavin Baker: first and last for Phantom.
[00:13:26] Gavin Baker: But from my perspective, it is a better chip.
[00:13:28] Gavin Baker: You know, maybe it's like an F35 or so Raphael.
[00:13:31] Gavin Baker: And so now that we know pre-training loss for holding,
[00:13:33] Gavin Baker: we know that these Blackwell models are going to be really good.
[00:13:36] Gavin Baker: And you know, kind of based on the raw specs,
[00:13:38] Gavin Baker: they should probably be better.
[00:13:40] Then something even more important happens.
[00:13:42] Gavin Baker: So the GB200 was really, really,
[00:13:45] Gavin Baker: it was really hard to get a coin.
[00:13:49] The GB300 is a great chip.
[00:13:53] It is drop in compatible in every way with those GB200 racks.
[00:13:58] Gavin Baker: Now you're not going to replace the GB200s.
[00:13:59] Gavin Baker: No, no power walls.
[00:14:01] Gavin Baker: Just any data center that can handle those,
[00:14:03] Gavin Baker: you can slot in the GB300s.
[00:14:05] Gavin Baker: And now everybody's good at making those racks.
[00:14:07] Gavin Baker: You know how to hit the heat out.
[00:14:08] Gavin Baker: You know how to cool them.
[00:14:09] Gavin Baker: You're going to put those GB300s in.
[00:14:11] Gavin Baker: And then the companies that use the GB300s,
[00:14:14] Gavin Baker: they are going to be the low cost producer of tokens,
[00:14:18] Gavin Baker: particularly if you're vertically integrated.
[00:14:19] Gavin Baker: If you're paying a margin to someone else
[00:14:21] Gavin Baker: to make those tokens, you're probably not going to be.
[00:14:23] Gavin Baker: And this has pretty profound implications
[00:14:26] Gavin Baker: because it, I think it has to change Google's
[00:14:28] Gavin Baker: strategic calculus.
[00:14:29] Gavin Baker: If you have a decisive cost advantage in your Google
[00:14:33] and you have search and all these other businesses,
[00:14:36] why not run AI at a negative 30% margin?
[00:14:41] Gavin Baker: It is by far the rational decision
[00:14:43] Gavin Baker: you take the economic oxygen out of the environment.
[00:14:47] Gavin Baker: You eventually make it hard for your competitors
[00:14:49] Gavin Baker: who need funding unlike you to raise the capital they need.
[00:14:54] Gavin Baker: And then on the other side of that,
[00:14:55] Gavin Baker: maybe you have an extremely dominant chair position.
[00:14:58] Gavin Baker: While that calculus changes,
[00:15:00] Gavin Baker: once Google is no longer the low cost producer,
[00:15:03] Gavin Baker: which I think will be the case,
[00:15:05] the black wells are now being used for training.
[00:15:07] Gavin Baker: And then when that model is trained,
[00:15:10] then you start shifting black well clusters
[00:15:12] Gavin Baker: over to inference.
[00:15:14] Gavin Baker: And then all these cost calculations
[00:15:15] Gavin Baker: and these dynamics change.
[00:15:17] And I do think it's very interesting,
[00:15:19] Gavin Baker: like during the strategic and economic calculations
[00:15:22] Gavin Baker: between the players, I've never seen anything like it.
[00:15:26] Gavin Baker: Everyone understands their position on the board.
[00:15:30] Gavin Baker: What the prize is, what play their opponents are running.
[00:15:35] Gavin Baker: And it's really interesting to watch.
[00:15:37] So I just see if Google changes its behavior,
[00:15:42] because it's going to be really painful for them
[00:15:43] Gavin Baker: as a higher cost producer to run that negative 30% margin.
[00:15:47] Gavin Baker: It might start to impact their stock.
[00:15:49] Gavin Baker: That has pretty profound implications for the economics of AI.
[00:15:52] Gavin Baker: And then when Ruben comes out,
[00:15:54] Gavin Baker: we'll know the gap is going to expand significantly.
[00:15:58] Gavin Baker: Versus TPUs.
[00:15:59] Gavin Baker: Versus TPUs and all other ASICs.
[00:16:02] Gavin Baker: Now I think training in three is probably
[00:16:03] Gavin Baker: going to be pretty good and training four
[00:16:04] Gavin Baker: are going to be good.
[00:16:04] Gavin Baker: Why is that the case?
[00:16:05] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Why won't TPU be 9B everybody's good?
[00:16:09] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: A couple of things.
[00:16:10] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: So one, for whatever reason, Google
[00:16:14] Gavin Baker: made more conservative design decisions.
[00:16:17] Part of that is, so Google, round numbers, Google,
[00:16:21] Gavin Baker: let's say the TPU, Google is, there's
[00:16:24] Gavin Baker: front end and back end of semiconductor design.
[00:16:28] And then there's dealing with Taiwan semi.
[00:16:30] Gavin Baker: You can make an ASIC in a lot of ways.
[00:16:33] Gavin Baker: What Google does is they do mostly the front end for the TPU.
[00:16:37] Gavin Baker: And then Broadcom does the back end
[00:16:39] Gavin Baker: and manages Taiwan semi and everything.
[00:16:41] Gavin Baker: It's a crude analogy.
[00:16:42] Gavin Baker: But the front end is like the architect of a house.
[00:16:46] They design a house.
[00:16:47] Gavin Baker: The back end is the person who builds the house.
[00:16:49] Gavin Baker: And the managing Taiwan semi is stamping out that house
[00:16:52] Gavin Baker: like Lunar or DR Horton.
[00:16:54] Gavin Baker: And four, doing those two lot of parts,
[00:16:58] Gavin Baker: Broadcom runs a 50 to 55% gross margin.
[00:17:01] Gavin Baker: We don't know what on TPUs.
[00:17:02] Gavin Baker: Let's say in 2027, TPU, I think it's its estimate.
[00:17:06] Gavin Baker: Maybe somewhere around 30 billion.
[00:17:08] Gavin Baker: Who knows?
[00:17:09] Gavin Baker: I mean, 20 billion.
[00:17:10] Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:11] Gavin Baker: But 30 billion, I think, is a reasonable estimate.
[00:17:14] 50 to 55% gross margins.
[00:17:17] Gavin Baker: So Google is paying Broadcom $15 billion.
[00:17:21] Gavin Baker: That's a lot of money.
[00:17:22] Gavin Baker: And at a certain point, it makes sense
[00:17:25] Gavin Baker: to bring a semiconductor program entirely in house.
[00:17:28] Gavin Baker: So in other words, Apple does not have an ASIC partner
[00:17:31] Gavin Baker: for their chips.
[00:17:33] They do the front end themselves, the back end,
[00:17:35] Gavin Baker: and they manage Taiwan semi.
[00:17:36] Gavin Baker: And the reason is they don't want to pay that 50% margin.
[00:17:39] Gavin Baker: So at a certain point, it becomes rational to renegotiate this
[00:17:43] Gavin Baker: and just just perspective.
[00:17:44] Gavin Baker: The entire op-ex of Broadcom semi-conductor division
[00:17:48] Gavin Baker: is around numbers $5 billion.
[00:17:50] Gavin Baker: So it'd be economically rational.
[00:17:52] Gavin Baker: Now that Google's paying, if it's 30 billion, or paying them 15,
[00:17:56] Gavin Baker: Google can go to every person who works in Broadcom semi,
[00:17:58] Gavin Baker: double their comp and make it extra 5 billion.
[00:18:03] Gavin Baker: In 2028, let's just say it does 50 billion.
[00:18:06] Gavin Baker: Now it's 25 billion.
[00:18:07] Gavin Baker: You could triple their comp.
[00:18:08] Gavin Baker: And by the way, you don't need them all.
[00:18:10] Gavin Baker: And of course, they're not going to do that
[00:18:11] Gavin Baker: because of competitive concerns.
[00:18:14] But with TPUVA, all of this, and V9, all of this
[00:18:18] Gavin Baker: is beginning to have an impact because Google
[00:18:20] Gavin Baker: is bringing in media tech.
[00:18:22] Gavin Baker: This is maybe the first way you send a warning shot
[00:18:25] Gavin Baker: to Broadcom.
[00:18:26] Gavin Baker: We're really not happy about all this money we're paying.
[00:18:29] Gavin Baker: But they did bring media tech in
[00:18:30] Gavin Baker: and the Taiwanese ASIC companies.
[00:18:32] Gavin Baker: I have much lower-verse margins.
[00:18:33] Gavin Baker: So this is kind of the first shot against the bowel.
[00:18:36] Gavin Baker: And then there's all this stuff.
[00:18:37] Gavin Baker: People say, oh, but Broadcom has the birth best 30s.
[00:18:40] Gavin Baker: Broadcom has really good 30s.
[00:18:42] Gavin Baker: And 30s is like an extremely foundational technology
[00:18:45] Gavin Baker: because it's how the chips communicate with each other.
[00:18:47] Gavin Baker: You have to serialize it.
[00:18:48] Gavin Baker: Do you serialize?
[00:18:49] Gavin Baker: But there are other good 30s providers in the world.
[00:18:52] Gavin Baker: A really good 30s is not, at a certain point,
[00:18:56] Gavin Baker: maybe it's worth 10 or 15 billion a year,
[00:18:57] Gavin Baker: but it's probably worth that with 25 billion a year.
[00:19:00] So because of that friction, and I think
[00:19:04] Gavin Baker: conservative design choices on the part of Google,
[00:19:07] Gavin Baker: and maybe the reason they made those conservative design choices
[00:19:10] Gavin Baker: is because they were going to a bifurcated supply.
[00:19:14] Gavin Baker: TPU is slowing down.
[00:19:16] Gavin Baker: I would say has kind of the GPUs are accelerating.
[00:19:20] Gavin Baker: This is the first, the competitive response of Lisa and Jensen
[00:19:25] Gavin Baker: to everybody saying we're going to have our own ASIC,
[00:19:27] Gavin Baker: is hey, we're just going to accelerate.
[00:19:29] Gavin Baker: We're going to do a GPU every year.
[00:19:31] And you cannot keep up with us.
[00:19:33] Gavin Baker: And then I think what everybody is learning is like, oh, wow.
[00:19:36] That's so cool.
[00:19:37] Gavin Baker: You made your own accelerator has an ASIC.
[00:19:39] Gavin Baker: Wow, what's the NIC going to be?
[00:19:41] Gavin Baker: What's the CPU going to be?
[00:19:43] Gavin Baker: What's the scale up switch going to be?
[00:19:45] Gavin Baker: What's the scale up protocol?
[00:19:47] Gavin Baker: What's the scale out switch?
[00:19:49] What kind of optics are you going to use?
[00:19:51] Gavin Baker: What's the software that's going to make all this work together?
[00:19:54] And then it's like, oh, shit, I made this tiny little chip.
[00:19:58] And whether it's admitted or not, I'm
[00:20:03] Gavin Baker: sure the GPUs don't, GPU makers don't love it when the customers
[00:20:06] Gavin Baker: make ASICs are trying to compete with them.
[00:20:08] Gavin Baker: And like, whoops, what did I do?
[00:20:11] Gavin Baker: I thought this was easy.
[00:20:13] Gavin Baker: And it also, it takes at least three generations
[00:20:16] Gavin Baker: to make a good chip.
[00:20:17] Gavin Baker: Like the TPUV1, I mean, it was an achievement
[00:20:20] Gavin Baker: and that they made it.
[00:20:22] Gavin Baker: It was really not till TPUV3 or V4 that the TPU started
[00:20:27] Gavin Baker: to become like even vaguely competitive.
[00:20:29] Gavin Baker: Is that just a classic learning by doing thing?
[00:20:32] Gavin Baker: 100%.
[00:20:33] Gavin Baker: And even if you've made, from my perspective,
[00:20:38] Gavin Baker: the best ASIC team at any semiconductor company
[00:20:41] Gavin Baker: is actually the Amazon ASIC team.
[00:20:43] Gavin Baker: They are the first one to make the graph drawn CPU.
[00:20:46] Gavin Baker: They have this Nitro.
[00:20:48] Gavin Baker: It was the first, it's called SuperNIC.
[00:20:49] Gavin Baker: They've been extremely innovative, really clever.
[00:20:52] And like, Trainiam and Infraintree One, they maybe
[00:20:57] they're a little better than the TPUV1,
[00:20:59] Gavin Baker: but only a little.
[00:21:00] Trainiam two, you get a little better.
[00:21:02] Gavin Baker: Trainiam three, it's, I think the first time, it's like,
[00:21:05] Gavin Baker: OK, and then I think Trainiam four will probably be good.
[00:21:08] Gavin Baker: I will be surprised if there are a lot of ASICs
[00:21:13] Gavin Baker: other than Trainiam and TPU.
[00:21:16] And by the way, in Trainiam and TPU,
[00:21:17] Gavin Baker: we'll both run on customer-owned tooling at some point.
[00:21:21] Gavin Baker: We can debate when that will happen,
[00:21:23] Gavin Baker: but the economics of success that I just described
[00:21:27] Gavin Baker: mean it's inevitable.
[00:21:28] Gavin Baker: Like, no matter what the companies say,
[00:21:31] Gavin Baker: just the economics make it, and reasoning
[00:21:33] Gavin Baker: from first principles make it absolutely inevitable.
[00:21:35] Gavin Baker: If I were to zoom all the way out on this stuff,
[00:21:38] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: because sometimes I just, I find these details
[00:21:40] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: unbelievably interesting, and it's like the grandest game
[00:21:43] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: that's ever been played.
[00:21:44] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: That's what I mean, it's crazy.
[00:21:45] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: It's so crazy and so fun to follow.
[00:21:47] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Sometimes I forget to zoom out and say, well, so what?
[00:21:49] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Like, OK, so, project this forward,
[00:21:52] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: three generations pass Rubin or whatever.
[00:21:54] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: What is like the global human dividend
[00:21:57] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: of all this crazy development?
[00:21:59] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Like, we keep making the loss lower
[00:22:02] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: on these pre-training scaling models.
[00:22:04] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Yeah.
[00:22:05] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Who cares?
[00:22:06] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: It's been a while since I've asked this thing something
[00:22:09] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: that I wasn't kind of blown away by the answer for me personally.
[00:22:12] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: What are the next couple of things
[00:22:13] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: that all this crazy infrastructure war
[00:22:16] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: allows us to unlock because they're so successful?
[00:22:19] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: If I were to pause it like an event path,
[00:22:21] Gavin Baker: I think the Blackwell models are going to be amazing.
[00:22:24] Gavin Baker: The dramatic reduction in partoken cost
[00:22:27] Gavin Baker: enabled by the GP300 and probably more the MI450
[00:22:30] Gavin Baker: than the MI355, will lead to these models
[00:22:33] Gavin Baker: being allowed to think for much longer,
[00:22:36] Gavin Baker: which means they're going to be able to do new things.
[00:22:40] Gavin Baker: Like, I was very impressed.
[00:22:41] Gavin Baker: Jim and I three made me a restaurant reservation.
[00:22:43] Gavin Baker: So the first time it's done something for me.
[00:22:46] Gavin Baker: And I mean, other than like go research something,
[00:22:49] Gavin Baker: change me stuff.
[00:22:50] Gavin Baker: But if you can make a restaurant reservation,
[00:22:52] Gavin Baker: you're not that far from being able to make a hotel reservation
[00:22:55] Gavin Baker: and an airplane reservation and order me an Uber.
[00:22:58] Gavin Baker: And all of a sudden you got an assistant.
[00:23:00] Gavin Baker: Yeah, and you can just imagine everybody talks about that.
[00:23:02] Gavin Baker: You can just imagine it's on your phone.
[00:23:04] Gavin Baker: I think that's pretty near term.
[00:23:06] Gavin Baker: But it's some big companies that are very tech forward.
[00:23:11] 50% plus of customer support is already done by AI.
[00:23:15] Gavin Baker: And that's a $400 billion industry.
[00:23:17] Gavin Baker: And then if what AI is great about is persuasion,
[00:23:20] Gavin Baker: that sales and customer support.
[00:23:22] Gavin Baker: And so of the functions of a company,
[00:23:24] Gavin Baker: if you think about them, they're to make stuff, sell stuff,
[00:23:28] Gavin Baker: and it support the customers.
[00:23:29] Gavin Baker: So right now maybe in late 26,
[00:23:32] Gavin Baker: you're going to be pretty good at two of them.
[00:23:34] Gavin Baker: I do think it's going to have a big impact on media.
[00:23:37] Gavin Baker: Like I think robotics, we talked about the last time,
[00:23:39] Gavin Baker: are going to finally start to be real.
[00:23:41] Gavin Baker: There's an explosion and kind of exciting robotics startups.
[00:23:44] Gavin Baker: I do still think that the main battle is going to be
[00:23:46] Gavin Baker: between Tesla's Optimus and the Chinese.
[00:23:49] Gavin Baker: Because it's easy to make prototypes.
[00:23:51] Gavin Baker: It's hard to mass produce them.
[00:23:53] Gavin Baker: But then it goes back to that what Andre Carpathy said
[00:23:55] Gavin Baker: about AI can automate anything that can be verified.
[00:23:59] Gavin Baker: So any function where there's a right or wrong answer,
[00:24:02] Gavin Baker: right or wrong outcome, you can apply reinforcement learning
[00:24:06] Gavin Baker: and make the AI really good at that.
[00:24:08] Gavin Baker: What are your favorite examples of that so far?
[00:24:11] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Or theoretically?
[00:24:11] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Does the model balance?
[00:24:12] Gavin Baker: They'll be really good at making models.
[00:24:14] Gavin Baker: Does do all the books globally reconcile?
[00:24:17] Gavin Baker: They'll be really good at accounting.
[00:24:19] Gavin Baker: Because it puts double entry bookkeeping
[00:24:22] Gavin Baker: and haste balance.
[00:24:23] Gavin Baker: There's a verifiable you got it right or wrong.
[00:24:25] Gavin Baker: Supporter, did you make the sale or not?
[00:24:27] Gavin Baker: That's very clear.
[00:24:28] Gavin Baker: I mean, that's just like AlphaGo.
[00:24:31] Gavin Baker: Did you win or you lose?
[00:24:32] Gavin Baker: Did the guy convert or not?
[00:24:34] Gavin Baker: Did the customer ask for an escalation
[00:24:36] Gavin Baker: during customer support or not?
[00:24:39] Gavin Baker: It's like it's most important functions are important
[00:24:42] Gavin Baker: because they can be verified, right?
[00:24:46] Gavin Baker: So I think if all of this starts to happen
[00:24:50] Gavin Baker: and starts to happen in 26,
[00:24:54] like they'll be in ROI on Blackwell,
[00:24:57] Gavin Baker: and then all this will continue,
[00:24:59] Gavin Baker: and then we'll have Rubin,
[00:25:01] and then that'll be another big quantum of spin,
[00:25:03] Gavin Baker: Rubin in the MI450 and the TPUV9.
[00:25:06] Gavin Baker: And then I do think just the most interesting question
[00:25:09] is what are the economic returns
[00:25:10] Gavin Baker: to artificial superintelligence?
[00:25:12] Gavin Baker: Because all of these companies in this great game,
[00:25:14] Gavin Baker: they've been in a prisoner's dilemma.
[00:25:16] Gavin Baker: They're terrified that if they slow down,
[00:25:18] Gavin Baker: they're just gone forever.
[00:25:19] Gavin Baker: And their competitors don't.
[00:25:21] Gavin Baker: It's an existential risk.
[00:25:22] Gavin Baker: And you know, Microsoft blinked for like six weeks
[00:25:26] Gavin Baker: earlier this year.
[00:25:27] Gavin Baker: Yeah.
[00:25:28] Gavin Baker: And like I think they would say they regret that.
[00:25:31] Gavin Baker: But with Blackwell and for sure with Rubin,
[00:25:35] Gavin Baker: economics are going to dominate the prisoner's dilemma
[00:25:38] Gavin Baker: from a decision making and spinning perspective
[00:25:41] Gavin Baker: just because the numbers are so big.
[00:25:43] And this goes to kind of the ROI on AI question.
[00:25:46] Gavin Baker: And the ROI on AI has empirically,
[00:25:50] Gavin Baker: factually, unambiguously been positive.
[00:25:54] Gavin Baker: Like I just always find it strange
[00:25:56] Gavin Baker: that there's any debate about this
[00:25:58] Gavin Baker: because the largest bidders are GPUs or public companies.
[00:26:02] Gavin Baker: They report something called audited quarterly financials.
[00:26:04] Gavin Baker: And you can use those things to calculate something
[00:26:06] Gavin Baker: called a return on an investment capital.
[00:26:08] Gavin Baker: And if you do that calculation,
[00:26:10] Gavin Baker: the ROIC of the big public spenders on GPUs
[00:26:12] Gavin Baker: is higher than it was before they ran spinning.
[00:26:14] Gavin Baker: And you could say, well, part of that is up savings.
[00:26:17] Gavin Baker: Well, at some level, that is part of what
[00:26:20] Gavin Baker: you expect the ROI to be for AI.
[00:26:23] Gavin Baker: And then you say, well, a lot of us actually just applying
[00:26:25] Gavin Baker: GPUs, moving the big, recommended systems
[00:26:27] Gavin Baker: that power the advertising and the recommendation systems
[00:26:30] Gavin Baker: from CPUs to GPUs.
[00:26:32] Gavin Baker: And you've had massive efficiency gains.
[00:26:34] Gavin Baker: And that's why all the revenue growth at these companies
[00:26:35] Gavin Baker: is accelerated.
[00:26:36] Gavin Baker: But like, so what?
[00:26:37] Gavin Baker: The ROI has been there.
[00:26:39] Gavin Baker: And it is interesting, like every big internet company,
[00:26:43] Gavin Baker: the people who are responsible for the revenue
[00:26:46] are intensely annoyed at the amount of GPUs
[00:26:50] Gavin Baker: that are being given to the researchers.
[00:26:52] It's a very linear question.
[00:26:53] Gavin Baker: If you give me more GPUs, I will drive more revenue.
[00:26:56] Gavin Baker: Give me those GPUs.
[00:26:57] Gavin Baker: We'll have more revenue, more growth profit.
[00:26:59] Gavin Baker: And then we can spend money.
[00:27:00] Gavin Baker: So it's as constant fight at every company.
[00:27:02] Gavin Baker: One of the factors in the prisoners to them
[00:27:04] Gavin Baker: is everybody has this like religious belief
[00:27:07] Gavin Baker: that we're going to get to ASI.
[00:27:09] Gavin Baker: And at the end of the day, what do they all want?
[00:27:11] Gavin Baker: Almost all of them want to live forever.
[00:27:13] Gavin Baker: And then you think that ASI's going to help them that.
[00:27:15] Gavin Baker: Good return.
[00:27:16] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: That's good return.
[00:27:17] But we don't know.
[00:27:19] Gavin Baker: And if it's humans, we have pushed the boundaries
[00:27:22] Gavin Baker: of physics, biology, and chemistry,
[00:27:24] Gavin Baker: the natural laws that govern the universe.
[00:27:26] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I'm very curious about your favorite throat cold water
[00:27:29] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: on this stuff type takes that you think about sometimes.
[00:27:32] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: One would be like the things that would cause,
[00:27:34] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I'm curious what you think, the things that would cause
[00:27:36] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: this demand for compute to change,
[00:27:38] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: or even the trajectory of it to change.
[00:27:40] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: There's one really obvious bear case.
[00:27:44] Gavin Baker: And it is just edge AI.
[00:27:46] Gavin Baker: And it's connected to the economic returns to ASI.
[00:27:48] Gavin Baker: In three years, on a bigger and bulkier phone
[00:27:51] Gavin Baker: to fit the amount of DRAM necessary,
[00:27:54] Gavin Baker: in the battery won't part of the last as long,
[00:27:56] you will be able to probably run a pruned down version
[00:28:00] Gavin Baker: of something like Gemini 5 or GROC4, GROC4.1,
[00:28:05] Gavin Baker: or Chatchy PT, Adam, I don't know, 30,
[00:28:10] Gavin Baker: 60 tokens per second.
[00:28:13] And then that's free.
[00:28:14] Gavin Baker: And this is clearly Apple's strategy.
[00:28:16] Gavin Baker: It's just we're going to be a distributor of AI,
[00:28:18] Gavin Baker: and we're going to make it privacy safe and run on the phone.
[00:28:21] Gavin Baker: And then you can call one of the big models,
[00:28:24] Gavin Baker: the God models in the cloud, whatever you have a question.
[00:28:28] Gavin Baker: And if that happens, if like 30 to 60 tokens,
[00:28:31] Gavin Baker: like on one, whatever it is, a 115,
[00:28:34] Gavin Baker: 30 to 60 tokens a second, at a 115 IQ is good enough,
[00:28:40] I think that's a bear case.
[00:28:42] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Other than just the scaling laws break.
[00:28:45] Gavin Baker: But in terms of if we assume scaling laws continue,
[00:28:48] Gavin Baker: and we now know they're going to continue for pre-training
[00:28:51] Gavin Baker: for at least one more generation,
[00:28:52] Gavin Baker: and we're very early in the two new scaling laws,
[00:28:56] Gavin Baker: for post-training, mid-training, RLVR, whatever people
[00:28:58] Gavin Baker: want to call it, and then test time computed inference,
[00:29:00] Gavin Baker: we're so early in those, and we're getting so much better
[00:29:03] Gavin Baker: at helping the models hold more and more context
[00:29:06] Gavin Baker: in their minds, has they do this test time compute,
[00:29:11] Gavin Baker: and that's really powerful because everybody's like,
[00:29:14] Gavin Baker: well, how's the model going to know this?
[00:29:16] Gavin Baker: Well, eventually you can hold enough context.
[00:29:18] Gavin Baker: You can just hold every Slack message,
[00:29:21] an Outlook message, and company manual,
[00:29:24] and in a company, in your context,
[00:29:28] Gavin Baker: and then you can compute the new task
[00:29:31] Gavin Baker: and compare it with your knowledge of the world,
[00:29:33] Gavin Baker: what you think, with the model things,
[00:29:34] Gavin Baker: all this context, and it may be that,
[00:29:37] Gavin Baker: just really, really long context windows
[00:29:40] Gavin Baker: are the solution to a lot of the current limitations,
[00:29:43] Gavin Baker: and that's enabled by all these cool tricks,
[00:29:45] Gavin Baker: like KV Cash Offload and stuff,
[00:29:47] Gavin Baker: but I do think other than scaling laws slowing down,
[00:29:51] Gavin Baker: other than there being low economic returns to ASI,
[00:29:55] edge AI is to me by far the most plausible
[00:29:59] Gavin Baker: and scariest bear case.
[00:30:01] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I like to visualize different S-curves
[00:30:02] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: you invested through the iPhone,
[00:30:04] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: and I love to see the visual of the iPhone models
[00:30:07] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: as it sort of went from this clunky, bricky thing
[00:30:10] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: up to the what we have now.
[00:30:11] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: We're like, each one's like a little bit,
[00:30:13] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: obviously we've sort of petered out on its form factor.
[00:30:16] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: If you picture something similar
[00:30:17] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: for the frontier models themselves,
[00:30:20] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: does it feel like it's at a certain part
[00:30:23] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: of that natural technology paradigm progression to you?
[00:30:26] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: If you're paying for Jim and I ultra are super rock,
[00:30:30] Gavin Baker: and you're getting the good AI,
[00:30:32] Gavin Baker: it's hard to see differences.
[00:30:33] Gavin Baker: I have to go really deep on something like,
[00:30:38] Gavin Baker: do you think PCI Express or Ethernet
[00:30:41] Gavin Baker: is a better protocol for scale-up networking and why?
[00:30:44] Gavin Baker: Show me the scientific papers.
[00:30:47] And if you shift between models
[00:30:49] Gavin Baker: and you ask a question like that,
[00:30:51] Gavin Baker: where you know it really deeply,
[00:30:53] Gavin Baker: know that then you see differences.
[00:30:57] Gavin Baker: I do play fantasy football,
[00:30:59] Gavin Baker: winnings are turning into charity,
[00:31:01] Gavin Baker: but it is like these new models are quite a bit better
[00:31:06] Gavin Baker: at helping like, who should I play?
[00:31:08] Gavin Baker: Yeah.
[00:31:09] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And they think in much more sophisticated ways.
[00:31:14] Gavin Baker: In both ways, if you're a historically good fantasy football player
[00:31:17] Gavin Baker: and you're having a bad season, it's why.
[00:31:20] Gavin Baker: This is why, because you're not using it.
[00:31:23] Gavin Baker: And I think we'll see that in more and more domains.
[00:31:26] Gavin Baker: But I do think they're already at a level
[00:31:29] Gavin Baker: where unless you're a true expert
[00:31:32] Gavin Baker: or just have an intellect that is beyond mind,
[00:31:35] Gavin Baker: it's hard to see the progress.
[00:31:39] Gavin Baker: And that's why I do think we need to shift
[00:31:41] from getting more intelligent to more useful.
[00:31:45] Gavin Baker: Unless more intelligence starts leading
[00:31:47] Gavin Baker: to these massive scientific breakthroughs.
[00:31:49] Gavin Baker: Breakthroughs, yeah.
[00:31:50] Gavin Baker: And we're hearing cancer in 26 and 27.
[00:31:52] Gavin Baker: I don't know that we're going to be hearing cancer,
[00:31:54] Gavin Baker: but I do think from an ROI, almost an ROIS curve,
[00:31:59] Gavin Baker: we need to kind of hand off from intelligence to usefulness.
[00:32:03] And then usefulness will then have to hand off
[00:32:07] Gavin Baker: to scientific breakthrough, just that creates whole new industries.
[00:32:11] Gavin Baker: What are the building blocks of usefulness in your mind?
[00:32:14] Gavin Baker: Just being able to do things consistently and reliably.
[00:32:17] Gavin Baker: And a lot of that is keeping all the context.
[00:32:21] Gavin Baker: Like there's a lot of context if someone wants to plan a trip for me.
[00:32:25] Gavin Baker: Like, I've acquired these strange preferences.
[00:32:27] Gavin Baker: Like I follow that guy, Andrew Cuperman.
[00:32:30] Gavin Baker: So I like to have an East-Facey balcony.
[00:32:31] Gavin Baker: So I can get morning sun.
[00:32:34] Gavin Baker: It's for the AI.
[00:32:35] Gavin Baker: I ask you remember, being on a plane with Starlink
[00:32:37] Gavin Baker: is important to me.
[00:32:39] Gavin Baker: OK, here are the resorts I've historically liked.
[00:32:41] Gavin Baker: Here are the kinds of areas I've liked.
[00:32:43] Gavin Baker: Here are the rooms that I would really like at each.
[00:32:46] Gavin Baker: That's a lot of context.
[00:32:47] Gavin Baker: And to keep all of that and kind of wait those,
[00:32:50] Gavin Baker: it's a hard problem.
[00:32:52] Gavin Baker: So I think context windows are a big part of it.
[00:32:54] Gavin Baker: There's this meter task evaluation thing.
[00:32:57] Gavin Baker: Like how long it can work for.
[00:32:58] Gavin Baker: How long it could work for.
[00:33:00] Gavin Baker: And you could think of that as being related in some way
[00:33:03] Gavin Baker: to context, not precisely.
[00:33:06] Gavin Baker: But that just task length needs to keep expanding.
[00:33:11] Gavin Baker: Because booking a restaurant and booking
[00:33:15] is economically useful.
[00:33:17] Gavin Baker: But it's not that economically useful.
[00:33:20] Gavin Baker: But booking me an entire vacation
[00:33:23] and knowing the preferences of my parents, my sister,
[00:33:26] Gavin Baker: my niece, and my nephew, and what it means that that's
[00:33:30] Gavin Baker: a much harder problem.
[00:33:31] Gavin Baker: And that's something that a human might spend three
[00:33:35] Gavin Baker: or four hours on optimizing that.
[00:33:37] Gavin Baker: And then if you can do that, that's amazing.
[00:33:40] But then again, it has to be good at sales and customer
[00:33:45] Gavin Baker: support relatively soon.
[00:33:47] Gavin Baker: I do think we're going to see in a kind of an acceleration
[00:33:49] Gavin Baker: in the awesomeness of various products
[00:33:51] Gavin Baker: just because engineers are using AI to make products better
[00:33:55] Gavin Baker: and faster.
[00:33:56] Gavin Baker: We both invested in Fortell, the hearing aid company,
[00:33:58] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: which is just absolutely remarkable.
[00:34:00] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, and I think it's something I never would have thought of.
[00:34:02] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And we're going to see, I think, something like that
[00:34:04] Gavin Baker: in every vertical.
[00:34:04] Gavin Baker: And that's AI being used for the most core function
[00:34:09] Gavin Baker: of any company, which is designing the product.
[00:34:12] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And then there's already lots of examples of AI being used
[00:34:15] Gavin Baker: to help manufacture the product and distribute it more
[00:34:18] Gavin Baker: efficiently.
[00:34:19] Gavin Baker: You'll weather top to my eyes like a supply chain,
[00:34:22] Gavin Baker: whether it's having a vision system,
[00:34:24] Gavin Baker: watch a production line.
[00:34:26] Gavin Baker: So I think a lot of stuff is happening.
[00:34:29] Gavin Baker: I think it's really interesting in this whole ROI part
[00:34:31] Gavin Baker: is Fortu 500 companies are always the last to adopt
[00:34:35] Gavin Baker: a new technology.
[00:34:35] Gavin Baker: They're conservative.
[00:34:36] Gavin Baker: They have lots of regulations, lots of lawyers.
[00:34:38] Gavin Baker: Startups are always the first.
[00:34:40] Gavin Baker: So let's think about the cloud, which was the first,
[00:34:43] Gavin Baker: which was the last really truly transformative new
[00:34:46] Gavin Baker: technology for enterprises.
[00:34:48] Gavin Baker: Being able to have all of your compute and the cloud
[00:34:52] Gavin Baker: and use SAS.
[00:34:53] Gavin Baker: So it's always upgraded.
[00:34:54] Gavin Baker: It's always great, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:34:56] Gavin Baker: You can get it on every device.
[00:34:58] Gavin Baker: I mean, those are dark days before the cloud, you know?
[00:35:00] Gavin Baker: The first AWS reinvent, I think it was in 2013.
[00:35:03] Gavin Baker: Every startup on planet Earth ran on the cloud.
[00:35:06] Gavin Baker: The idea that you would buy your own server and storage
[00:35:08] Gavin Baker: box and router was ridiculous.
[00:35:10] Gavin Baker: And that probably happened even earlier.
[00:35:12] Gavin Baker: That had probably already happened before the first reinvent.
[00:35:15] Gavin Baker: And then the first big Fortu 500 company
[00:35:17] Gavin Baker: started standardizing it maybe five years later.
[00:35:20] Gavin Baker: You see that with AI.
[00:35:21] Gavin Baker: I'm sure you've seen this in your startups.
[00:35:23] Gavin Baker: And I think one reason VCs are more broadly bullish on AI
[00:35:26] Gavin Baker: than public market investors is VCs see very real productivity
[00:35:30] Gavin Baker: gains.
[00:35:30] Gavin Baker: There's all these charts that for a given level of revenue,
[00:35:34] a company today has significantly lower employees
[00:35:38] Gavin Baker: than a company of two years ago.
[00:35:40] Gavin Baker: And the reason is AI is doing a lot of the sales, the support,
[00:35:45] Gavin Baker: and helping to make the product.
[00:35:46] Gavin Baker: I mean, there is, you know, iconic has some charts, a 16z.
[00:35:49] Gavin Baker: By the way, David George is a good friend.
[00:35:51] Gavin Baker: Great guy.
[00:35:52] Gavin Baker: He has his model busters thing.
[00:35:54] Gavin Baker: So there's very clear data that this is happening.
[00:35:56] Gavin Baker: So people who have a lens into the world of venture see this.
[00:35:59] Gavin Baker: And I do think it was very important in the third quarter.
[00:36:01] Gavin Baker: This is the first quarter where we had Fortu 500 companies
[00:36:05] Gavin Baker: outside of the tech industry give specific quantitative examples
[00:36:09] Gavin Baker: of AI driven uplift.
[00:36:11] Gavin Baker: So C. A. Robinson went up something like 20% on earnings.
[00:36:15] Gavin Baker: And should I tell people what C. A.
[00:36:18] Gavin Baker: Let's just say truck goes from Chicago to Denver.
[00:36:23] Gavin Baker: And then the trucker lives in Chicago.
[00:36:25] Gavin Baker: So it's going to go back from Denver to Chicago.
[00:36:27] Gavin Baker: There's an empty load.
[00:36:29] Gavin Baker: And C. A. Robinson has all these relationships
[00:36:31] Gavin Baker: with truckers and trucking companies.
[00:36:33] Gavin Baker: And they match shippers demand with that empty load supply
[00:36:38] Gavin Baker: to make the trucking more efficient.
[00:36:40] Gavin Baker: They're a free foreritor.
[00:36:41] Gavin Baker: There's actually lots of companies like this.
[00:36:44] Gavin Baker: But kind of they're the biggest and most dominant.
[00:36:46] Gavin Baker: So one of the most important things they do
[00:36:49] Gavin Baker: is they quote price and availability.
[00:36:51] Gavin Baker: So somebody a customer calls them up and says,
[00:36:53] Gavin Baker: hey, I urgently need 3, 18 wheelers from Chicago to Denver.
[00:36:58] Gavin Baker: In the past, they said it would take them 15 to 45 minutes.
[00:37:02] Gavin Baker: And they only quoted 60% of inbound requests.
[00:37:08] With AI, they're quoting 100% and doing it in seconds.
[00:37:12] And so they printed a great quarter and stock went up 20%.
[00:37:15] Gavin Baker: And it was a cuss of AI driven productivity that's impacting
[00:37:19] Gavin Baker: the revenue line, the cost line, everything.
[00:37:21] Gavin Baker: And so I actually think that's pretty important
[00:37:23] Gavin Baker: because I was actually very worried about the idea
[00:37:26] Gavin Baker: that we might have this Blackwell ROI air gap
[00:37:29] Gavin Baker: because we're spending so much money on Blackwell.
[00:37:31] Gavin Baker: Those Blackwells are being used for training.
[00:37:33] Gavin Baker: And there's no ROI on training.
[00:37:35] Gavin Baker: Training is you're making the model.
[00:37:36] Gavin Baker: The ROI comes from inference.
[00:37:38] Gavin Baker: So I was really worried that we're going to have maybe
[00:37:41] Gavin Baker: this 3 quarter period where the cap acts
[00:37:43] Gavin Baker: as unimaginably high.
[00:37:45] Gavin Baker: Those Blackwells are only being used for training.
[00:37:47] Gavin Baker: Right.
[00:37:48] Gavin Baker: And our thing flat, I've got that flat.
[00:37:50] Gavin Baker: Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:51] Gavin Baker: And so ROIC goes down.
[00:37:52] Gavin Baker: And you can see like meta, meta they printed,
[00:37:55] Gavin Baker: because meta has not been able to make a frontier model.
[00:37:58] Gavin Baker: Meta printed a quarter where ROIC declined.
[00:38:01] Gavin Baker: And that was not good for the stock.
[00:38:02] Gavin Baker: So I was really worried about this.
[00:38:04] Gavin Baker: I do think that those data points are important
[00:38:06] Gavin Baker: in terms of suggesting that maybe we'll
[00:38:08] Gavin Baker: be able to navigate this potential air gap in ROIC.
[00:38:12] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: It makes me wonder about in this market,
[00:38:14] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I'm like everybody else.
[00:38:15] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: It's the 10 companies at the top that are all the market cap
[00:38:18] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: more than all of the attention.
[00:38:20] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: There's 49 of the other companies, the S500.
[00:38:22] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: You studied those too.
[00:38:23] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: What do you think about that group?
[00:38:26] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: What is interesting to you about the group that now nobody
[00:38:29] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: seems to talk about?
[00:38:30] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And no one really seems to care about because they haven't
[00:38:32] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: driven returns and they're a smaller percent
[00:38:34] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: of the overall impact.
[00:38:36] Gavin Baker: I think that people are going to start to care.
[00:38:37] Gavin Baker: If you have more and more companies,
[00:38:38] Gavin Baker: print these C-drop and some like quarters.
[00:38:41] Gavin Baker: The companies that have historically been really well run.
[00:38:46] The reason they have a long track record of success
[00:38:50] Gavin Baker: is they have a long, you cannot succeed
[00:38:52] Gavin Baker: without using technology well.
[00:38:54] Gavin Baker: And so if you have a kind of internal culture
[00:38:56] Gavin Baker: of experimentation and innovation,
[00:38:58] Gavin Baker: I think you will do well with AI.
[00:39:00] Gavin Baker: So I would bet on the best investment banks
[00:39:03] Gavin Baker: to be earlier and better adopters of AI
[00:39:08] Gavin Baker: than maybe some of the trailing banks.
[00:39:11] Which is sometimes past days prologue.
[00:39:14] Gavin Baker: One thing that I strong opinion I have,
[00:39:17] all these VCs are setting up these holding companies.
[00:39:19] Gavin Baker: And we're going to use AI to make traditional businesses better.
[00:39:23] And they're really smart VCs and they're great track records.
[00:39:27] Gavin Baker: But that's what private equity has been doing for 50 years.
[00:39:30] You're just not going to be private equity at their game.
[00:39:34] And what Bista did in the early days, right?
[00:39:35] Gavin Baker: Yeah.
[00:39:36] Gavin Baker: Private equities maybe had a little bit of a tough run.
[00:39:38] Gavin Baker: Just multiples have gone up.
[00:39:40] Gavin Baker: Private assets are more expensive.
[00:39:41] Gavin Baker: The cost of financing has gone up.
[00:39:43] Gavin Baker: It's tough to take a company public
[00:39:45] Gavin Baker: because the public valuation is 30% lower
[00:39:47] Gavin Baker: than the private valuation.
[00:39:48] Gavin Baker: So P's had a tough run.
[00:39:50] Gavin Baker: I actually think these private equity firms
[00:39:52] Gavin Baker: are going to be pretty good at systematically applying AI.
[00:39:57] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: We haven't spent much time talking about meta and
[00:39:59] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: traffic or open AI.
[00:40:00] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And I'd love just like your impression on everything
[00:40:02] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: that's going on in this infrastructure side that we talked about.
[00:40:05] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: These are three really important players in this grand battle,
[00:40:08] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: this grand game.
[00:40:09] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: How does all of this development that we've discussed so far
[00:40:12] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: impact those players specifically, do you think?
[00:40:15] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: First thing, let me just say about frontier models broadly.
[00:40:17] Gavin Baker: Yeah.
[00:40:18] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: In 2023 and 24, I was fond of quoting Eric Fisheria.
[00:40:24] And Eric Fisheria's statement, our friend, brilliant man.
[00:40:27] Gavin Baker: And Eric would always say foundation models are the fastest
[00:40:30] Gavin Baker: appreciating assets in history.
[00:40:32] Gavin Baker: And I would say he was 90% right.
[00:40:34] Gavin Baker: I modified the statement.
[00:40:35] Gavin Baker: I said foundation models without unique data and internet
[00:40:39] Gavin Baker: scale distribution are the fastest appreciating assets in history.
[00:40:42] Gavin Baker: But reasoning fundamentally changed that in a really profound way.
[00:40:45] Gavin Baker: There was a loop, a flywheel to quote Jeff Bezos,
[00:40:48] Gavin Baker: that it was at the heart of every great internet company.
[00:40:52] Gavin Baker: And it was, you made a good product.
[00:40:54] Gavin Baker: You got users, those users using the product generated data
[00:40:57] Gavin Baker: that could be fed back into the product to make it better.
[00:41:00] Gavin Baker: And that flywheel has been spinning at Netflix, at Amazon,
[00:41:03] Gavin Baker: Meta at Google for over a decade.
[00:41:07] Gavin Baker: And that's an incredibly powerful flywheel.
[00:41:10] Gavin Baker: And it's why those internet businesses were so tough to compete
[00:41:13] Gavin Baker: with.
[00:41:13] Gavin Baker: It's why they're increasing returns to scale.
[00:41:16] Gavin Baker: Everybody talks about network effects.
[00:41:17] Gavin Baker: Much more in network effects, they were important for social
[00:41:21] Gavin Baker: networks.
[00:41:21] Gavin Baker: I don't know to what extent meta is a social network anymore.
[00:41:24] Gavin Baker: It's more like a content distribution.
[00:41:26] Gavin Baker: But they just had increasing returns to scale because of that
[00:41:30] Gavin Baker: flywheel.
[00:41:32] And that dynamic was not present in the pre-reasoning world
[00:41:35] Gavin Baker: of AI.
[00:41:36] Gavin Baker: You pre-trained a model.
[00:41:38] You let it out in the world.
[00:41:40] Gavin Baker: And it was what it was.
[00:41:41] Gavin Baker: And it was actually pretty hard, though,
[00:41:43] Gavin Baker: to do RLHF reinforcement learning with human feedback.
[00:41:46] Gavin Baker: And you try and make the bot model better.
[00:41:48] Gavin Baker: And maybe you'd get a sensor to it revives that people didn't
[00:41:51] Gavin Baker: like this.
[00:41:51] Gavin Baker: And so you tweak it.
[00:41:53] Gavin Baker: And there were the little up and down arrows.
[00:41:55] Gavin Baker: But it was actually pretty hard to feed that back into the model.
[00:41:58] Gavin Baker: With reasoning, it's early, but that flywheel
[00:42:02] Gavin Baker: is started to spin.
[00:42:03] Gavin Baker: And that is really profound for these frontier labs.
[00:42:08] Gavin Baker: So one, reasoning fundamentally changed the industry dynamics
[00:42:11] Gavin Baker: of frontier labs.
[00:42:12] Gavin Baker: Just explain why specifically that is, what is going on?
[00:42:15] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Because if a lot of people are asking a similar question,
[00:42:20] and they're consistently either liking or not liking the answer,
[00:42:26] Gavin Baker: then you can use that as a verifiable reward that's a good outcome.
[00:42:32] Gavin Baker: And then you can use feed those good answers back into the model.
[00:42:37] Gavin Baker: And we're very early at this flywheel spinning.
[00:42:42] Gavin Baker: It's hard to do now.
[00:42:44] But you can see it beginning to spin.
[00:42:47] Gavin Baker: So this is important, in fact, number one, for all of those dynamics.
[00:42:50] Gavin Baker: Second, I think it's really important that meta, Mark Zuckerberg,
[00:42:55] Gavin Baker: at the beginning of this year and January,
[00:42:57] Gavin Baker: said, I anticipate, you know, I'm highly confident,
[00:43:00] Gavin Baker: I'm going to get the quote wrong, that at some point in 2025,
[00:43:03] Gavin Baker: we're going to have the best and most performant AI.
[00:43:06] Gavin Baker: I don't know if he's in the top 100, OK?
[00:43:08] Gavin Baker: So he was as wrong as it was possible to be.
[00:43:11] Gavin Baker: And I think that is a really important fact,
[00:43:14] Gavin Baker: because it suggests that what these four companies have done
[00:43:18] Gavin Baker: is really hard to do.
[00:43:19] Gavin Baker: Because meta threw a lot of money at it.
[00:43:22] Gavin Baker: And they failed.
[00:43:23] Gavin Baker: Yamakoon had to leave.
[00:43:25] Gavin Baker: They had to have the famous billion dollar for AI researchers.
[00:43:29] Gavin Baker: By the way, Microsoft also failed.
[00:43:32] Gavin Baker: They did not make such an unequivocal prediction.
[00:43:35] But they bought inflection AI.
[00:43:38] Gavin Baker: And there were a lot of comments from them
[00:43:40] Gavin Baker: that we anticipate our internal models quickly getting better.
[00:43:43] Gavin Baker: And we're going to run more and more of our AI
[00:43:46] Gavin Baker: on our internal models.
[00:43:47] Gavin Baker: As an Amazon, they bought a company called the Dept AI.
[00:43:51] They have their models called Nova.
[00:43:53] I don't think they're in the top 20.
[00:43:55] Gavin Baker: So clearly, it's much harder to do than people
[00:43:58] Gavin Baker: thought a year ago.
[00:43:59] Gavin Baker: And there's many, many reasons for that.
[00:44:01] Gavin Baker: It's actually really hard to keep a big cluster
[00:44:04] Gavin Baker: of GPUs coherent.
[00:44:05] Gavin Baker: A lot of these companies were used to running their infrastructure
[00:44:08] Gavin Baker: to optimize for costs instead of performance.
[00:44:13] Gavin Baker: Complexity and complexity.
[00:44:15] Gavin Baker: And keeping the GPUs running at high utilization rate
[00:44:19] Gavin Baker: and a big cluster, it's actually really hard.
[00:44:22] Gavin Baker: And there are wild variations in how well companies run GPUs.
[00:44:28] Gavin Baker: And if you're running, if the most anybody
[00:44:30] Gavin Baker: because the lots of physics, maybe you get
[00:44:32] Gavin Baker: 200,000 to 300,000 black wells coherent, we'll see.
[00:44:35] Gavin Baker: But if you have 30% uptime on that cluster
[00:44:38] Gavin Baker: and you're competing with somebody who has 90% uptime,
[00:44:40] Gavin Baker: you're not even competing.
[00:44:42] Gavin Baker: So one, there's a huge spectrum in how well people run GPUs.
[00:44:45] Gavin Baker: Two, then I think there is these AI researchers
[00:44:48] Gavin Baker: they like to talk about taste.
[00:44:50] Gavin Baker: I find it very funny.
[00:44:51] Gavin Baker: Why do you make so much money?
[00:44:53] Gavin Baker: I have very good taste.
[00:44:55] Gavin Baker: What taste means is you have a good intuitive sense
[00:44:58] Gavin Baker: for the experiments to perform.
[00:45:00] Gavin Baker: And this is why you pay people a lot of money.
[00:45:03] Gavin Baker: Because it actually turns out that as these models get bigger,
[00:45:06] Gavin Baker: you can no longer run an experiment on 1,000 GPU cluster
[00:45:09] Gavin Baker: and replicate it on 100,000 GPUs.
[00:45:11] Gavin Baker: You need to run that experiment on 50,000 GPUs.
[00:45:15] Gavin Baker: And maybe it takes days.
[00:45:17] Gavin Baker: And so there's a very high opportunity cost.
[00:45:20] Gavin Baker: And so you have to have a really good team
[00:45:23] that can make the right decisions about which experiments
[00:45:25] Gavin Baker: to run on this.
[00:45:26] Gavin Baker: And then you need to do all the reinforcement learning
[00:45:30] Gavin Baker: during post-training well and the test time
[00:45:31] Gavin Baker: could be well.
[00:45:32] Gavin Baker: It's a complicated.
[00:45:33] Gavin Baker: It's really hard to do.
[00:45:35] Gavin Baker: And everything's it's easy.
[00:45:36] Gavin Baker: But all those things you'd I used to have the saying,
[00:45:38] Gavin Baker: like, hey, I was retelling on this long ago.
[00:45:41] Gavin Baker: Pick any vertical in America.
[00:45:43] If you can just run 1,000 stores and have them clean,
[00:45:47] Gavin Baker: well-lit, stocked with relevant goods at good prices
[00:45:54] Gavin Baker: and staffed by friendly employees who are not stealing from you,
[00:45:58] Gavin Baker: you're going to be a $20 billion company,
[00:46:00] Gavin Baker: a $30 billion company.
[00:46:01] Gavin Baker: Like, 15 companies have been able to do that.
[00:46:03] Gavin Baker: It's really hard.
[00:46:04] Gavin Baker: And it's the same thing.
[00:46:05] Gavin Baker: Doing all of these things well is really hard.
[00:46:10] And then reasoning with this flywheel, this is beginning
[00:46:14] Gavin Baker: to create a very separate tree.
[00:46:16] Gavin Baker: And what's even more important, every one of those labs,
[00:46:20] Gavin Baker: XAI, Gemini, OpenAI, and Anthropic,
[00:46:23] Gavin Baker: they have a more advanced checkpoint internally
[00:46:28] Gavin Baker: of the model.
[00:46:28] Gavin Baker: Checkpoint is just kind of continuously working
[00:46:31] Gavin Baker: on these models.
[00:46:32] Gavin Baker: And then you release kind of a checkpoint.
[00:46:34] Gavin Baker: And then the reason these models get fast is when
[00:46:36] Gavin Baker: the returnally is for sort of a new.
[00:46:37] Gavin Baker: And they're using that model to train the next model.
[00:46:41] Gavin Baker: And if you do not have that latest checkpoint,
[00:46:45] Gavin Baker: it's getting really hard to catch up.
[00:46:48] Gavin Baker: Chinese open source is a gift from God to matter.
[00:46:52] Gavin Baker: Because you can use Chinese open source to try.
[00:46:56] Gavin Baker: And that can be your checkpoint.
[00:46:58] Gavin Baker: And you can use that as a way to kind of bootstrap this.
[00:47:01] Gavin Baker: And that's what I'm sure they're trying to do in everybody else.
[00:47:05] Gavin Baker: The big problem and the big giant swing factor,
[00:47:08] Gavin Baker: I think China has made a terrible mistake with this rarest thing.
[00:47:11] Gavin Baker: I think China, because they have the Huawei as in.
[00:47:14] Gavin Baker: And it's a decent chip.
[00:47:15] Gavin Baker: And versus something like the deprecated hoppers every
[00:47:19] Gavin Baker: time, it looks OK.
[00:47:20] Gavin Baker: And so they're trying to force Chinese open source
[00:47:22] Gavin Baker: to use their Chinese chips.
[00:47:24] Gavin Baker: They're domestically designed chips.
[00:47:26] Gavin Baker: The problem is, Blackwell is going to come out now
[00:47:29] Gavin Baker: in the gap between these American frontier labs
[00:47:32] Gavin Baker: in Chinese open source is going to blow out
[00:47:34] Gavin Baker: because of Blackwell.
[00:47:35] Gavin Baker: And actually deep seek in their most recent technical paper
[00:47:38] Gavin Baker: V3.2 said like one of the reasons we struggle to compete
[00:47:41] Gavin Baker: with the American frontier labs
[00:47:43] Gavin Baker: is we don't have enough compute.
[00:47:44] Gavin Baker: That was their very politically correct,
[00:47:47] Gavin Baker: still a little bit risky way of saying,
[00:47:49] Gavin Baker: you know, if it's China said we don't want the Blackwells.
[00:47:52] Gavin Baker: That's right.
[00:47:53] Gavin Baker: And they're saying, guys, if I be a big mistake,
[00:47:55] Gavin Baker: that might be a big mistake.
[00:47:57] And so if you just kind of play this out,
[00:47:59] Gavin Baker: these four American labs are going to start to widen
[00:48:03] Gavin Baker: their gap for Chinese open source,
[00:48:04] Gavin Baker: which then makes it harder for anyone else to catch up
[00:48:07] Gavin Baker: because that gap is growing.
[00:48:09] Gavin Baker: So you can't use Chinese open source to bootstrap.
[00:48:11] Gavin Baker: And then geopolitically, China thought they had the leverage,
[00:48:15] they're going to realize, oh, whoopsie daisy,
[00:48:17] Gavin Baker: we do need the Blackwells.
[00:48:18] Gavin Baker: And unfortunately, the problem for them,
[00:48:21] Gavin Baker: they'll probably realize that in late 26.
[00:48:24] And at that point, there's an enormous effort
[00:48:26] Gavin Baker: underway to our past.
[00:48:27] Gavin Baker: There's all sorts of really cool
[00:48:28] Gavin Baker: DARPA and DOD programs to incentivize
[00:48:31] Gavin Baker: really clever technical logical solutions for rarests,
[00:48:33] Gavin Baker: you know, like using enzymes to refine them
[00:48:36] Gavin Baker: or there's all sorts of really cool things happening.
[00:48:39] Gavin Baker: And then there's a lot of rare earth deposits
[00:48:42] Gavin Baker: in countries that are very friendly to America
[00:48:45] Gavin Baker: that don't mind actually refining it in the traditional way.
[00:48:49] Gavin Baker: So I think rare earths are going to be solved way faster
[00:48:52] Gavin Baker: than anyone thinks.
[00:48:53] Gavin Baker: They're obviously not that rare.
[00:48:54] Gavin Baker: They're just misnamed.
[00:48:55] Gavin Baker: They're rare because they're really messy to refine.
[00:48:58] Gavin Baker: And so geopolitically, I actually think Blackwells
[00:49:00] Gavin Baker: is pretty significant.
[00:49:03] Gavin Baker: And it's going to give America a lot of leverage
[00:49:05] Gavin Baker: has this gap widens.
[00:49:07] Gavin Baker: And then in the context of all of that,
[00:49:09] Gavin Baker: going back to the dynamics between these companies,
[00:49:11] Gavin Baker: I'd say I will be out with the first Blackwell model.
[00:49:13] Gavin Baker: And then they'll be the first ones probably using Blackwell
[00:49:15] Gavin Baker: for inference at scale.
[00:49:17] Gavin Baker: And I think that's an important moment for them.
[00:49:18] Gavin Baker: And by the way, it is funny, like,
[00:49:20] Gavin Baker: you know, if you go on OpenRouter, you can just look.
[00:49:23] Gavin Baker: They have dominant share now, OpenRouter is whatever it is.
[00:49:26] Gavin Baker: It's 1% of API tokens.
[00:49:28] Gavin Baker: But it's an indication.
[00:49:30] Gavin Baker: They process 1.35 trillion tokens.
[00:49:32] Gavin Baker: Google did like 800, 900 billion.
[00:49:34] Gavin Baker: This is like whatever it is, last seven days or last month.
[00:49:37] Gavin Baker: You know, Anthropic was at 700 billion.
[00:49:39] Gavin Baker: Like XAI is doing really, really well.
[00:49:42] Gavin Baker: And the model is fantastic.
[00:49:43] Gavin Baker: I highly recommend it.
[00:49:44] Gavin Baker: But you'll see XAI, you know, come out with this.
[00:49:47] Gavin Baker: OpenAI will come out faster.
[00:49:49] Gavin Baker: OpenAI's issue that they're trying to solve a stargate
[00:49:52] Gavin Baker: is because they pay a margin to people for compute.
[00:49:55] Gavin Baker: And maybe the people who run their compute
[00:49:57] Gavin Baker: are not the best at running GPUs.
[00:49:59] Gavin Baker: They're a high cost producer of tokens.
[00:50:02] And I think this kind of explains a lot of their code red
[00:50:06] Gavin Baker: recently.
[00:50:06] Gavin Baker: Yeah, well, just the $1.4 trillion in spending commitments.
[00:50:10] Gavin Baker: And I think that was just like, hey,
[00:50:11] Gavin Baker: they know they're going to need to raise a lot of money,
[00:50:15] Gavin Baker: particularly if Google keeps its current strategy
[00:50:18] Gavin Baker: of sucking the economic oxygen out of the room.
[00:50:21] Gavin Baker: And you go from 1.4 trillion, rough vibes, code red,
[00:50:23] Gavin Baker: like pretty fast, you know.
[00:50:25] Gavin Baker: And the reason they have a code red
[00:50:27] Gavin Baker: is because of all these dynamics.
[00:50:29] Gavin Baker: So then they'll come out with a model,
[00:50:30] Gavin Baker: but they will not have fixed their per token cost disadvantage
[00:50:33] Gavin Baker: relative to both XAI and Google.
[00:50:36] Gavin Baker: And almost an anthropic at that point.
[00:50:38] Gavin Baker: Anthropic is a good company.
[00:50:40] Gavin Baker: You know, they're burning dramatically less cash
[00:50:43] than OpenAI and growing faster.
[00:50:44] Gavin Baker: So I think you have to give in,
[00:50:45] Gavin Baker: anthropic a lot of credit.
[00:50:46] Gavin Baker: And a lot of that is their relationship with Google
[00:50:49] Gavin Baker: and Amazon for the TPUs and the trainings.
[00:50:51] Gavin Baker: And so Anthropic has been able to benefit
[00:50:53] Gavin Baker: from the same dynamics that Google has.
[00:50:55] Gavin Baker: I think it's very indicative in this great game of chess.
[00:50:58] Gavin Baker: You know, you can look at Dario, Jensen,
[00:51:00] Gavin Baker: maybe have taken a few public comments,
[00:51:03] Gavin Baker: you know, that were, you know, made between them,
[00:51:06] Gavin Baker: just a little bit of jasting.
[00:51:08] Gavin Baker: Well, Anthropic just signed the $5 billion deal
[00:51:10] Gavin Baker: within video.
[00:51:11] Gavin Baker: That is because Dario is a smart man
[00:51:14] Gavin Baker: and he understands these dynamics
[00:51:16] Gavin Baker: about Black, Wall, and Rubid relative to TPU.
[00:51:19] Gavin Baker: And so Nvidia now goes from having two of the fighters,
[00:51:23] two fighters, XAI and OpenAI, two three fighters.
[00:51:27] Gavin Baker: So that helps in this Nvidia versus Google battle.
[00:51:31] Gavin Baker: And then if meta can catch up, that's really important.
[00:51:36] Gavin Baker: And so I am sure Nvidia is doing whatever they can
[00:51:40] Gavin Baker: to help meta, you know, whatever.
[00:51:42] Gavin Baker: Like let us, you're running those GPUs this way.
[00:51:46] Maybe we should twist the screw this way
[00:51:49] Gavin Baker: or turn the dial that way.
[00:51:50] Gavin Baker: And then it will be also if Black,
[00:51:53] Gavin Baker: Wall comes back to China,
[00:51:54] Gavin Baker: which it seems like it'll probably happen.
[00:51:56] Gavin Baker: That will also be very good
[00:51:57] Gavin Baker: because then Chinese Open Source will be back.
[00:51:59] Gavin Baker: What other, I'm always so curious
[00:52:01] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: about the polls of things.
[00:52:02] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Like one poll would be the other breakthroughs
[00:52:04] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: that you have your mind on, things in the data center
[00:52:07] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: that aren't chips that we've talked about before
[00:52:09] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: as one example.
[00:52:10] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I think the most important thing that's going to happen
[00:52:12] Gavin Baker: in the world, in this world,
[00:52:14] in the next three to four years is data centers in space.
[00:52:18] Gavin Baker: And this has really profound implications
[00:52:21] for everyone building a power plant
[00:52:23] or a data center on planet Earth.
[00:52:25] Gavin Baker: Okay.
[00:52:27] Gavin Baker: And there is a giant gold rush into this.
[00:52:29] Gavin Baker: I've heard anything about this.
[00:52:30] Gavin Baker: So please, as you do.
[00:52:31] Gavin Baker: You know, it's like everybody thinks like,
[00:52:32] Gavin Baker: hey, AI is risky.
[00:52:33] Gavin Baker: You know, but you know what,
[00:52:35] Gavin Baker: I'm going to build a data center.
[00:52:36] Gavin Baker: I'm going to build a power plant
[00:52:37] Gavin Baker: that's going to do a data center.
[00:52:38] Gavin Baker: We will need that.
[00:52:39] Gavin Baker: But if you think about it from first principles,
[00:52:41] Gavin Baker: data centers should be in space.
[00:52:43] Gavin Baker: Okay.
[00:52:44] Gavin Baker: What are the fundamental inputs to running a data center?
[00:52:48] Gavin Baker: Their power and their cooling.
[00:52:51] Gavin Baker: And then there are the chips.
[00:52:52] Gavin Baker: That's like the total,
[00:52:53] Gavin Baker: if you think about it from a total cost perspective.
[00:52:55] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Yeah.
[00:52:55] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And just the inputs to making the tokens
[00:52:57] Gavin Baker: come out of the magic machines.
[00:52:59] Gavin Baker: Yeah.
[00:53:00] So in space,
[00:53:02] Gavin Baker: you can keep a satellite in the sun 24 hours a day.
[00:53:07] Gavin Baker: And the sun is 30% more intense.
[00:53:09] Gavin Baker: You know, you can keep it in the sun
[00:53:10] Gavin Baker: just because like if the sun's here,
[00:53:12] Gavin Baker: here's this, you know, you can have the satellite,
[00:53:14] Gavin Baker: you know, always kind of catching the light.
[00:53:17] Gavin Baker: Catching the light.
[00:53:18] Gavin Baker: The sun is 30% more intense.
[00:53:19] Gavin Baker: And this results in six times more irradiance
[00:53:22] Gavin Baker: and outer space than on planet Earth.
[00:53:25] Gavin Baker: So you're getting a lot of solar energy.
[00:53:27] Gavin Baker: Point number one.
[00:53:28] Gavin Baker: Point number two,
[00:53:29] Gavin Baker: because you're in the sun 24 hours a day,
[00:53:31] Gavin Baker: you don't need a battery.
[00:53:33] Gavin Baker: And this is a giant percentage of the cost.
[00:53:35] Gavin Baker: So the lowest cost energy available in our solar system
[00:53:41] Gavin Baker: is solar energy and space.
[00:53:43] Gavin Baker: Okay.
[00:53:44] Second, for cooling.
[00:53:46] Gavin Baker: And one of these racks,
[00:53:48] Gavin Baker: a majority of the mass in the weight is cooling.
[00:53:51] And the cooling in these data centers
[00:53:54] Gavin Baker: is incredibly complicated, you know,
[00:53:56] Gavin Baker: I mean, the HVAC, the CDU,
[00:53:58] Gavin Baker: the liquid cooling.
[00:53:59] Gavin Baker: It's very cool to see.
[00:54:00] Gavin Baker: It's amazing to see.
[00:54:01] Gavin Baker: And space cooling is free.
[00:54:02] Gavin Baker: You just put a radiator on the dark side of the satellite
[00:54:07] Gavin Baker: and go all the way.
[00:54:08] Gavin Baker: And as close to absolute zero as you can get.
[00:54:11] So all that goes away.
[00:54:12] Gavin Baker: And that is a vast amount of cost.
[00:54:15] Gavin Baker: Okay.
[00:54:16] Gavin Baker: Let's think about how these, you know,
[00:54:19] Gavin Baker: maybe each satellite is kind of a rock.
[00:54:21] Gavin Baker: It's one way to think of it.
[00:54:22] Gavin Baker: Maybe some people make bigger satellites
[00:54:24] Gavin Baker: that are through racks.
[00:54:25] Gavin Baker: Well, how are you going to connect those racks?
[00:54:27] Gavin Baker: Well, it's funny in the data center.
[00:54:29] Gavin Baker: The racks are over a certain distance,
[00:54:32] Gavin Baker: connected with fiber optics.
[00:54:34] Gavin Baker: And that just means a laser going through a cable.
[00:54:37] The only thing faster than a laser going through
[00:54:39] Gavin Baker: a fiber optic cable is a laser going through absolute vacuum.
[00:54:43] So if you can link these satellites in space together
[00:54:47] Gavin Baker: using lasers, you actually have a faster
[00:54:50] Gavin Baker: and more coherent network
[00:54:52] Gavin Baker: than in a data center on Earth.
[00:54:54] Gavin Baker: Okay.
[00:54:55] Gavin Baker: For training, that's going to take a long time
[00:54:58] Gavin Baker: just because it's so big.
[00:54:59] Gavin Baker: Yeah, just because it's so big.
[00:55:00] Gavin Baker: But for inference,
[00:55:02] Gavin Baker: but I think even training will eventually happen.
[00:55:04] Gavin Baker: But then for inference, let's think about the user experience.
[00:55:07] Gavin Baker: When I, when we asked, when I asked Groka
[00:55:10] Gavin Baker: and about you and it gave the nice answer,
[00:55:12] Gavin Baker: a radio wave traveled from my cell phone to a cell tower.
[00:55:16] Then it hit the base station, went into a fiber optic cable,
[00:55:19] Gavin Baker: went to some sort of metro aggregation facility in New York,
[00:55:23] Gavin Baker: right within like, you know, tin blocks here.
[00:55:26] Gavin Baker: There's a small little metro router
[00:55:28] Gavin Baker: that's routed those packets to a big XAI data center somewhere.
[00:55:35] Okay.
[00:55:35] And then the computation was done
[00:55:38] Gavin Baker: and it came back over the same path.
[00:55:41] If the satellites can communicate directly with the phone
[00:55:45] Gavin Baker: and start linking his demonstrated direct to cell capability,
[00:55:48] Gavin Baker: you just go boom, boom.
[00:55:50] It's a much better lower cost user experience.
[00:55:54] Gavin Baker: So in every way,
[00:55:56] Gavin Baker: data centers in space from a first principle's perspective
[00:56:01] Gavin Baker: are superior to data centers on earth.
[00:56:03] Gavin Baker: So if we could teleport that into existence,
[00:56:05] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I understand that that portion.
[00:56:07] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: What are the frictions to that?
[00:56:09] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Like why will that not happen?
[00:56:10] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Is it launch costs?
[00:56:11] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Is it launch availability?
[00:56:12] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: We need a lot of those spaces and starships.
[00:56:15] Gavin Baker: Yeah.
[00:56:16] Gavin Baker: Like the starships are the only ones
[00:56:17] Gavin Baker: that can completely make that happen.
[00:56:19] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: We need a lot of those starships.
[00:56:21] Gavin Baker: You know, maybe China or Russia will be able to land a rocket.
[00:56:24] Gavin Baker: Blue origin just landed a booster.
[00:56:26] Gavin Baker: It's an entirely new and different way to think about SpaceX.
[00:56:30] Gavin Baker: And it is interesting that, you know, Elon posted yesterday
[00:56:34] Gavin Baker: or said in an interview that Tesla SpaceX and XAI
[00:56:38] Gavin Baker: are kind of converging.
[00:56:39] Gavin Baker: We're converging and they really are.
[00:56:41] Gavin Baker: So XAI will be the intelligence module for Optimus
[00:56:45] Gavin Baker: made by Tesla with Tesla Vision.
[00:56:47] Gavin Baker: Has its perception system.
[00:56:49] Gavin Baker: And then SpaceX will have the data centers in space
[00:56:54] Gavin Baker: that will power a lot of the AI, presumably for XAI and Tesla
[00:56:59] Gavin Baker: and the Optimus and a lot of other companies.
[00:57:01] Gavin Baker: And it's just interesting the way that they are converging.
[00:57:06] Gavin Baker: And each one is kind of creating competitive advantage
[00:57:09] Gavin Baker: for the other.
[00:57:10] Gavin Baker: So if you're XAI, it's really nice.
[00:57:13] Gavin Baker: Then you have this built-in relationship with Optimus.
[00:57:15] Gavin Baker: And now Tesla's a public company.
[00:57:17] Gavin Baker: So there's going to be, I cannot imagine the level of vetting.
[00:57:20] Gavin Baker: You'll go into that, it's your company agreement.
[00:57:23] Gavin Baker: And then you have a big advantage
[00:57:25] Gavin Baker: with these data centers in space.
[00:57:28] Gavin Baker: And then it's also nice if you're XAI
[00:57:31] Gavin Baker: that you have two companies with a lot of customers
[00:57:35] Gavin Baker: who you can use to help build your customer support
[00:57:39] Gavin Baker: agents, your customer sales agents with, kind of built-in
[00:57:42] Gavin Baker: customers.
[00:57:43] Gavin Baker: So they really are all kind of converging in a neat way.
[00:57:47] Gavin Baker: And I do think it's going to be a big moment when that first
[00:57:50] Gavin Baker: black well model comes out from XAI next year.
[00:57:54] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: If I go to the other end of the spectrum,
[00:57:55] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: and I think about something that seems to have been
[00:57:57] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: historically endemic to the human economic experience,
[00:58:00] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: that shortages are always followed by gluts in capital cycles.
[00:58:05] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: What if, in this case, the shortages
[00:58:08] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: compute, like Mark Chen now is on the record
[00:58:10] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: of saying they would consume 10X as much compute
[00:58:13] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: if you gave it to him in a couple weeks.
[00:58:15] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: So there seems to still be a massive shortage of compute,
[00:58:18] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: which is all the stuff we've talked about today.
[00:58:19] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: But there also just seems to be this iron law of history
[00:58:22] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: that gluts follow shortages.
[00:58:24] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: What do you think about that concept as it relates to this?
[00:58:26] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: There will be a lot.
[00:58:27] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: There will be a lot.
[00:58:29] Gavin Baker: You know, an AI is fundamentally different than the software
[00:58:32] Gavin Baker: just in that every time you use AI takes compute,
[00:58:37] Gavin Baker: in a way that traditional software just did not.
[00:58:39] Gavin Baker: I mean, it is true.
[00:58:40] Gavin Baker: I think every one of these companies
[00:58:42] Gavin Baker: could consume 10X more compute.
[00:58:44] Gavin Baker: Like what would happen is just the $200 tier would get a lot better.
[00:58:48] Gavin Baker: The free tier would get like the $200 tier.
[00:58:50] Gavin Baker: Google has started to monetize AI mode with ads,
[00:58:53] Gavin Baker: and I think that will give everyone else permission
[00:58:55] Gavin Baker: to introduce ads into the free mode.
[00:58:57] Gavin Baker: And then that is going to be an important source of ROI.
[00:59:00] Gavin Baker: You know, like open-eyes tailor-made.
[00:59:02] Gavin Baker: Yeah, absolutely.
[00:59:03] Gavin Baker: All of them in actions like, hey, here are your three vacations.
[00:59:07] Gavin Baker: Would you like me to book one?
[00:59:09] Gavin Baker: And then they're for sure going to collect a commission.
[00:59:11] Gavin Baker: Yeah.
[00:59:11] Gavin Baker: You know, here is, you know, there's many ways you can make money.
[00:59:14] Gavin Baker: I think we went into great detail on,
[00:59:17] maybe a prior podcast about how just inventory dynamics
[00:59:20] Gavin Baker: made these inventory cycles inevitable in simmys.
[00:59:24] Gavin Baker: And the iron law of simmys is just the customer buffer
[00:59:27] Gavin Baker: inventory has to equal lead times.
[00:59:29] Gavin Baker: And that's why you got these inventory cycles historically.
[00:59:32] Gavin Baker: We haven't seen a true capacity cycle in simmys.
[00:59:36] Gavin Baker: Maybe arguably since the late 90s,
[00:59:38] Gavin Baker: and that's because Taiwan Simmy has been so good
[00:59:40] Gavin Baker: at aggregating and smoothing supply.
[00:59:44] And a big problem in the world right now
[00:59:47] Gavin Baker: is that Taiwan Simmy is not expanding capacity
[00:59:49] Gavin Baker: as fast as their customers want.
[00:59:51] Gavin Baker: Yeah.
[00:59:52] Gavin Baker: And I think this is actually a pretty big,
[00:59:53] Gavin Baker: they're in the process of making mistakes just because,
[00:59:56] you know, you do have intel and with these fabs.
[00:59:59] Gavin Baker: They're not as good, and it's really hard to work
[01:00:01] Gavin Baker: with their PDK.
[01:00:03] But now you have this guy, Leap Boo,
[01:00:04] Gavin Baker: who's a really good executive
[01:00:07] Gavin Baker: and really understands that business.
[01:00:08] Gavin Baker: I mean, by the way, Patrick Helsinger,
[01:00:10] Gavin Baker: I think was also a good executive.
[01:00:12] Gavin Baker: And he put intel on the only strategy
[01:00:14] Gavin Baker: that could result in success.
[01:00:16] Gavin Baker: And I actually think it's shameful
[01:00:17] Gavin Baker: that the intel board fired him when they did it.
[01:00:19] Gavin Baker: But Leap Boo is a good executive
[01:00:20] Gavin Baker: and now he's reaping the benefits of Patrick's strategy.
[01:00:23] Gavin Baker: And Intel has all these empty fabs.
[01:00:25] Gavin Baker: And eventually, given the shortages we have of compute,
[01:00:30] Gavin Baker: those fabs are going to be filled.
[01:00:31] Gavin Baker: So I think Taiwan Simmy is in the process
[01:00:33] Gavin Baker: of making mistakes, but they're just so paranoid
[01:00:35] Gavin Baker: about an overbuilt.
[01:00:37] Gavin Baker: And they're so skeptical.
[01:00:38] Gavin Baker: They're the guys who met with Sim Altman
[01:00:40] Gavin Baker: and laughed at said, he's a podcast, bro.
[01:00:43] Gavin Baker: He has no idea what he's talking about.
[01:00:46] Gavin Baker: They're terrified of an overbuilt.
[01:00:48] Gavin Baker: So it may be that Taiwan Simmy,
[01:00:51] single-handedly that they're cautious.
[01:00:53] Gavin Baker: It's the brakes on the bubble.
[01:00:54] Gavin Baker: It's the governor.
[01:00:58] Gavin Baker: And we do, like I think governors are good.
[01:01:01] Gavin Baker: It's good that powers a governor.
[01:01:03] Gavin Baker: It's good that Taiwan Simmy is a governor.
[01:01:05] Gavin Baker: If Taiwan Simmy opens up at the same time
[01:01:09] Gavin Baker: when data centers in space relieve all power constraints,
[01:01:13] Gavin Baker: but that's like, I don't know, five, six years away,
[01:01:16] Gavin Baker: the data centers in space are a majority
[01:01:17] Gavin Baker: of deployed megawatts.
[01:01:18] Gavin Baker: Like, yeah, I think you can get it overbuilt really fast,
[01:01:20] Gavin Baker: but just we have these two really powerful natural governors.
[01:01:25] Gavin Baker: And I think that's good.
[01:01:26] Gavin Baker: Like smoother and longer is good.
[01:01:28] Gavin Baker: We haven't talked about the power
[01:01:30] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: of the vanilla to it through the space thing.
[01:01:32] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Haven't talked about power very much.
[01:01:34] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Power was like the most uninteresting topic.
[01:01:36] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Because the demand and nothing really changed
[01:01:38] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: for like a really, really long time.
[01:01:40] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: All of a sudden, I'm trying to figure out
[01:01:41] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: how to get like gigawatts here and everywhere.
[01:01:43] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: How do you think about, are you interested in power?
[01:01:45] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Well, very interested.
[01:01:46] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I do feel lucky in a prior life,
[01:01:47] Gavin Baker: I was the sector leader for the telecom and utilities team.
[01:01:50] Gavin Baker: Okay.
[01:01:51] Gavin Baker: I do have some base level of knowledge.
[01:01:53] Gavin Baker: So what, you know, having,
[01:01:55] Gavin Baker: having lots as a constraint is like really good
[01:01:58] Gavin Baker: for the most advanced Compu players.
[01:02:01] Gavin Baker: Because if lots are the constraint,
[01:02:03] the price you pay for Computus are relevant.
[01:02:05] Gavin Baker: The TCO of your Computus is absolutely irrelevant.
[01:02:08] Gavin Baker: Because if you could get three X or four X
[01:02:10] Gavin Baker: or five X more tokens per watt,
[01:02:13] Gavin Baker: that is literally three or four X or five X more revenue.
[01:02:17] And so, you know, it's just like if you're gonna build a,
[01:02:20] like okay, like an advanced data center costs 50 billion,
[01:02:23] Gavin Baker: a data center with your ASIC maybe costs 35 billion,
[01:02:26] Gavin Baker: but if that 50 billion dollar revenue,
[01:02:28] Gavin Baker: if that 50 billion dollar data center
[01:02:31] pubs out 25 billion of revenue
[01:02:33] Gavin Baker: and your ASIC data center at 35 billion,
[01:02:36] Gavin Baker: is only pumping out 8 billion.
[01:02:37] Gavin Baker: Well, like you're, you know, you're pretty pumped.
[01:02:39] Gavin Baker: It's good for like all of the most advanced technologies
[01:02:44] Gavin Baker: in the data center, which is exciting to be as an investor.
[01:02:47] Gavin Baker: So as long as power is a governor,
[01:02:49] Gavin Baker: the best products are gonna win irrespective of price
[01:02:52] Gavin Baker: and have crazy pricing power, okay?
[01:02:55] Gavin Baker: I think that's, that's the first application
[01:02:57] Gavin Baker: that's really important to me.
[01:02:58] Gavin Baker: Second, it is in the only solutions to this,
[01:03:02] Gavin Baker: we just can't build nuclear fast enough in America,
[01:03:05] Gavin Baker: like as much as we would love to build nuclear quickly,
[01:03:08] Gavin Baker: we just can't, we just can't.
[01:03:10] Gavin Baker: It's just too hard, you know,
[01:03:12] Gavin Baker: NEPA, all these rules, like it's just, it's too hard.
[01:03:15] Gavin Baker: Like our rare ant that we could move
[01:03:18] Gavin Baker: and it could be in a better environment
[01:03:20] Gavin Baker: can totally delay the construction
[01:03:23] Gavin Baker: of a nuclear power plant, you know, one ant.
[01:03:26] That's crazy actually.
[01:03:28] Gavin Baker: Like humans need to come first.
[01:03:29] Gavin Baker: We need to have a human centric view of the world.
[01:03:31] Gavin Baker: But like the solutions are natural gas and solar.
[01:03:35] Gavin Baker: And the great thing is, the great thing
[01:03:36] Gavin Baker: about these AI data centers is apart from the ones
[01:03:39] Gavin Baker: that you're gonna do and for its own,
[01:03:41] Gavin Baker: you can locate them anywhere.
[01:03:43] Gavin Baker: So I think you were going to see,
[01:03:44] Gavin Baker: and this is why you're seeing all this activity in Abelene,
[01:03:47] Gavin Baker: you know, because it's in the middle
[01:03:48] Gavin Baker: of a big natural gas basin,
[01:03:50] Gavin Baker: and we have a lot of natural gas in America
[01:03:52] Gavin Baker: because of fracking.
[01:03:53] Gavin Baker: Yeah, I think we were gonna have a lot of natural gas
[01:03:55] Gavin Baker: for a long time.
[01:03:56] Gavin Baker: We had rare production really fast.
[01:03:58] Gavin Baker: So I think this is gonna be solved.
[01:04:00] Gavin Baker: You know, you're gonna have power plants fed by gas or solar.
[01:04:03] Gavin Baker: I think that's the solution.
[01:04:04] Gavin Baker: And you know, you're already, you know,
[01:04:06] Gavin Baker: all these turbine manufacturers were reluctant
[01:04:08] Gavin Baker: to expand capacity, caterpillar just said,
[01:04:10] Gavin Baker: we're gonna increase capacity by 75% over the next few years.
[01:04:14] Gavin Baker: So like the system on the power side
[01:04:16] Gavin Baker: is beginning to respond.
[01:04:18] Gavin Baker: One of the reasons that I always still love talking to you
[01:04:20] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: is that you do, like you do as much in the top 10
[01:04:23] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: companies in the world as you do looking at,
[01:04:24] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: you brand new companies with, you know, entrepreneurs
[01:04:27] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: that are 25 years old trying to do something amazing.
[01:04:30] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And so you have this very broad sense of what's going on.
[01:04:33] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: If I think about that second category
[01:04:35] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: of young, enterprising technologists
[01:04:38] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: who now are like AI, they're like kind of the first generation
[01:04:40] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: of AI native entrepreneurs.
[01:04:43] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: What are you seeing in that group that's notable
[01:04:45] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: or surprising or interesting?
[01:04:47] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: These young CEOs, they're just so impressive in all ways.
[01:04:51] Gavin Baker: And they get more polished faster.
[01:04:53] Gavin Baker: And I think the reason is, is they're talking to the AI.
[01:04:56] Gavin Baker: How should I deal with pitching this investor?
[01:04:58] Gavin Baker: I'm meeting with Patrick O'Shaughnessy.
[01:05:01] What do you think the best ways I should pitch a mark?
[01:05:03] Gavin Baker: Yeah, and it works.
[01:05:04] Gavin Baker: Do a deep research.
[01:05:05] Gavin Baker: And it's good.
[01:05:06] Gavin Baker: Yeah.
[01:05:07] Gavin Baker: You know, hey, I have this difficult HR situation.
[01:05:10] How would you handle it?
[01:05:11] Gavin Baker: That's correct.
[01:05:12] Gavin Baker: And it's good at that.
[01:05:13] Gavin Baker: How would you, you know, we're struggling to sell our product.
[01:05:17] Gavin Baker: What changes would you make?
[01:05:20] Gavin Baker: And it's really good at all of that today.
[01:05:23] And so when that goes to these, you know,
[01:05:26] Gavin Baker: VCs are seeing massive AI productivity in all their companies.
[01:05:31] Gavin Baker: It's because their companies are full of these, you know,
[01:05:33] Gavin Baker: 23, 24 or, you know, even younger AI natives.
[01:05:37] Gavin Baker: I've been so impressed with like young investment talent.
[01:05:42] Gavin Baker: And it's just part of it, like your podcast is part of that.
[01:05:45] Gavin Baker: There's just, you know, knowledge and very,
[01:05:49] Gavin Baker: very specific knowledge has became so accessible, you know,
[01:05:53] Gavin Baker: through podcasts and the internet, impressive young people come in.
[01:05:57] Gavin Baker: And they're just, I feel like they're where I was as an investor,
[01:06:00] Gavin Baker: like in my, you know, early 30s and their 22.
[01:06:02] Gavin Baker: And I'm like, oh my God.
[01:06:03] Gavin Baker: Yeah.
[01:06:04] Gavin Baker: Like I have to run so fast to keep up.
[01:06:06] Gavin Baker: These kids who are growing up native in AI,
[01:06:09] Gavin Baker: they're just proficient with it in a way that I can try
[01:06:14] Gavin Baker: and really hard to become.
[01:06:15] Gavin Baker: Can we talk about semis VCs specifically?
[01:06:18] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And like what is interesting in that universe?
[01:06:20] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Oh, just one thing I just, that I just think is so cool about it.
[01:06:23] Gavin Baker: And so underappreciated is your average city conductor venture founder
[01:06:27] Gavin Baker: is like 50 years old.
[01:06:29] Gavin Baker: Okay.
[01:06:30] Gavin Baker: And Jensen and what's happened with Nvidia
[01:06:32] Gavin Baker: and the market cap of the video has like single handedly ignited
[01:06:36] Gavin Baker: and I did some conductor venture.
[01:06:37] Gavin Baker: But the way it's ignited it, it's ignited in an awesome way.
[01:06:40] Gavin Baker: That's like really good for actually Nvidia and Google and everyone
[01:06:44] Gavin Baker: is like, let's just say you're the best DSP architect in the world.
[01:06:48] Gavin Baker: You had made for the last 20 years, every two years,
[01:06:52] Gavin Baker: because that's what you have to do.
[01:06:53] Gavin Baker: Symmic conductors, it's like every two years
[01:06:55] Gavin Baker: you have to run a race.
[01:06:57] Gavin Baker: And if you won the last race, you start like a foot ahead.
[01:07:01] Gavin Baker: And over time, those compound and make each race easier to win.
[01:07:05] Gavin Baker: But like maybe that person and his team,
[01:07:08] Gavin Baker: maybe he's ahead of networking at a big public company.
[01:07:11] Gavin Baker: He's making a lot of money and he has a good life.
[01:07:13] Gavin Baker: And then because he sees these outcomes
[01:07:16] Gavin Baker: and the size of the markets of the data center,
[01:07:18] Gavin Baker: he's like, wow, I don't know, I just go start my own company.
[01:07:20] Gavin Baker: But the reason that's important is that I forget the number,
[01:07:23] Gavin Baker: but I mean, there are thousands of parts in a black well rack.
[01:07:26] Gavin Baker: And there's thousands of parts in a TPU rack.
[01:07:29] Gavin Baker: And in the black well rack, maybe Nvidia makes,
[01:07:32] I don't know, two or three hundred of those parts.
[01:07:36] And you know, same thing in an AMD rack.
[01:07:38] Gavin Baker: And they need all of those other parts to accelerate with them.
[01:07:43] Gavin Baker: So they couldn't go to this one year cadence.
[01:07:47] Gavin Baker: If the rest, everything was not keeping up with them.
[01:07:51] Gavin Baker: The fact that Symmic conductor Venture has come back with a vengeance,
[01:07:55] Gavin Baker: you know, Silicon Valley, stopping Silicon Valley long ago.
[01:07:57] Gavin Baker: My little firm, maybe has done more Symmic conductor deals
[01:08:00] Gavin Baker: in the last seven years than the top 10 VCs combined.
[01:08:03] Gavin Baker: But that's really, really important because now you have
[01:08:08] Gavin Baker: an ecosystem of companies who can keep up.
[01:08:11] Gavin Baker: And then that ecosystem of these venture companies
[01:08:14] Gavin Baker: is putting pressure on the public companies
[01:08:17] Gavin Baker: that are also need to part of this.
[01:08:19] Gavin Baker: And we're going to go to this annual cadence,
[01:08:22] Gavin Baker: which is just so hard.
[01:08:24] Gavin Baker: And it's one reason I'm really skeptical of these ASICs
[01:08:26] Gavin Baker: that don't already have some degree of success.
[01:08:30] Gavin Baker: So I do think that's a super, super important dynamic.
[01:08:33] Gavin Baker: And one that's absolutely foundation
[01:08:36] Gavin Baker: and necessary for all of this to happen.
[01:08:39] Gavin Baker: Because not even Nvidia can do it alone.
[01:08:41] Gavin Baker: Not AMD can't do it alone.
[01:08:42] Gavin Baker: Google can't do it alone.
[01:08:44] Gavin Baker: You need the people who make the transceivers.
[01:08:47] Gavin Baker: You need the people who make the wires,
[01:08:49] Gavin Baker: who make the backplanes, you know, who make every,
[01:08:52] Gavin Baker: who make the lasers.
[01:08:53] Gavin Baker: They all have to accelerate with you.
[01:08:55] Gavin Baker: And one thing that I think is very cool about AI as an investor
[01:08:57] Gavin Baker: is it's just, it's the first time where every level of the stack
[01:09:02] that I look at, at least, the most important competitors
[01:09:04] Gavin Baker: are public and private.
[01:09:06] Gavin Baker: You know, so Nvidia, they're very important, you know,
[01:09:10] Gavin Baker: private competitors, you know,
[01:09:11] Broadcom, important private competitors.
[01:09:13] Gavin Baker: Marvell, important private competitors, you know,
[01:09:15] Gavin Baker: Lumid, Coherent, all these companies.
[01:09:17] Gavin Baker: You know, there's even like a wave of innovation in memory,
[01:09:20] Gavin Baker: which is really exciting to see.
[01:09:22] Gavin Baker: Because memory is such a gaining factor.
[01:09:25] Gavin Baker: But something that could slow all this down and be a natural governor
[01:09:27] Gavin Baker: is if we get our first true DRAM cycle since the late 90s.
[01:09:31] Gavin Baker: Same or that means.
[01:09:32] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: You know, if like a DRAM wafer is like valued at like a five-carat diamond.
[01:09:37] Gavin Baker: Yeah.
[01:09:38] Gavin Baker: In the 90s, when he had these true capacity cycles,
[01:09:39] Gavin Baker: before Taiwan, some he kind of smoothed everything out
[01:09:42] Gavin Baker: and DRAM became more of an oligopoly.
[01:09:44] Gavin Baker: You know, you would have these crazy shortages
[01:09:46] Gavin Baker: where the price would just go 10x.
[01:09:48] Gavin Baker: These are unimaginable relative to the last 25 years.
[01:09:53] Gavin Baker: Well, like a giant DRAM cycle,
[01:09:55] Gavin Baker: a good DRAM cycle is a price start to stop squint down.
[01:09:58] Gavin Baker: An epic cycle is maybe it goes up, you know,
[01:10:01] Gavin Baker: whatever it is, 30, 40, 50%.
[01:10:03] Gavin Baker: But I mean, if it starts to go up by x's instead of percentages,
[01:10:06] Gavin Baker: that's a whole different game.
[01:10:08] Gavin Baker: By the way, we should talk about SAS.
[01:10:10] Gavin Baker: Yeah, let's talk about it.
[01:10:11] Gavin Baker: What do you think is going to happen?
[01:10:12] Gavin Baker: Applications, SAS companies are making the exact same mistake
[01:10:15] Gavin Baker: that Brick and Mortar retailers did with e-commerce.
[01:10:18] Gavin Baker: So Brick and Mortar retailers, you know,
[01:10:20] Gavin Baker: particularly after the telecom bubble crashed.
[01:10:25] Gavin Baker: You know, they looked at Amazon and they said,
[01:10:26] Gavin Baker: oh, it's losing money.
[01:10:28] You know, e-commerce is going to be a low-martred business.
[01:10:30] Gavin Baker: You know, how can just, you know, from first principles,
[01:10:34] Gavin Baker: how can it ever be more efficient as a business?
[01:10:37] Gavin Baker: Right now, our customers pay to transport themselves to the store
[01:10:42] and then they pay to transport the goods home.
[01:10:44] Gavin Baker: How can it ever be more efficient
[01:10:46] Gavin Baker: if we're, you know, sending shipments out,
[01:10:48] Gavin Baker: you know, to individual customers, you know,
[01:10:50] Gavin Baker: in Amazon's vision, of course,
[01:10:51] Gavin Baker: will eventually we're just going to go to the street
[01:10:53] Gavin Baker: and drop off a package at every house.
[01:10:55] Gavin Baker: And so they did not invest in e-commerce.
[01:10:57] Gavin Baker: They clearly saw customer demand for it,
[01:11:00] Gavin Baker: but they did not like the margin structure of e-commerce.
[01:11:03] Gavin Baker: That is the fundamental reason that essentially
[01:11:06] Gavin Baker: every Brick and Mortar retailer was really slow
[01:11:09] Gavin Baker: to invest in e-commerce.
[01:11:10] Gavin Baker: And now here we are and, you know,
[01:11:12] Gavin Baker: Amazon has higher margins and they're
[01:11:14] Gavin Baker: an North American retail business.
[01:11:15] Gavin Baker: Then a lot of retailers that are mass market retailers.
[01:11:18] Gavin Baker: You know, so margins can change.
[01:11:20] Gavin Baker: And if there's a fundamental transformative kind of new technology
[01:11:26] Gavin Baker: that customers are demanding,
[01:11:27] Gavin Baker: it's always a mistake not to embrace it.
[01:11:30] Gavin Baker: And that's exactly what the SaaS companies are doing.
[01:11:33] They have their 70, 80, 90% gross margins
[01:11:36] and they are reluctant to accept AI gross margins.
[01:11:39] Gavin Baker: You know, the very nature of AI is, you know,
[01:11:41] Gavin Baker: software you write at once and it's written very efficiently
[01:11:45] Gavin Baker: and then you can distribute it broadly at very low cost.
[01:11:48] Gavin Baker: And that's why it was a great business.
[01:11:49] Gavin Baker: AI is the exact opposite where you have to recompute
[01:11:53] Gavin Baker: the answer every time.
[01:11:54] Gavin Baker: And so, you know, a good AI company
[01:11:57] Gavin Baker: might have gross margins of 40%.
[01:12:00] Now, the crazy thing is because of those efficiency gains,
[01:12:04] they're generated cash way earlier than other people,
[01:12:07] Gavin Baker: you know, than other SaaS companies did historically,
[01:12:09] Gavin Baker: but they're generated cash earlier
[01:12:11] Gavin Baker: not because they have high gross margins
[01:12:12] Gavin Baker: but because they have very few human employees.
[01:12:15] Gavin Baker: And it's just tragic to watch all of these companies.
[01:12:18] Gavin Baker: Like, you want to have an agent?
[01:12:20] Gavin Baker: It's never going to succeed if you're not willing to run it
[01:12:24] Gavin Baker: at a sub 35% gross margin.
[01:12:27] Because that's what the AI natives are ready to add.
[01:12:29] Gavin Baker: Maybe they're ready in a 40.
[01:12:31] Gavin Baker: So if you were trying to preserve an 80% gross margin structure,
[01:12:35] Gavin Baker: you are guaranteed that you will not succeed at AI.
[01:12:40] Absolute guarantee.
[01:12:41] Gavin Baker: And this is so crazy to me because one,
[01:12:45] Gavin Baker: we have an existence proof for software investors
[01:12:48] Gavin Baker: being willing to tolerate gross margin pressure
[01:12:52] Gavin Baker: as long as gross profit dollars are okay.
[01:12:54] Gavin Baker: It's called the cloud.
[01:12:56] People don't remember,
[01:12:57] Gavin Baker: but you know, when Adobe converted from on-premise
[01:13:01] Gavin Baker: to the cloud, you know, to a SaaS model,
[01:13:04] Gavin Baker: not only did their margins implode,
[01:13:05] Gavin Baker: they're actually revenues imploded too.
[01:13:08] Gavin Baker: Because you went from charging up front,
[01:13:10] Gavin Baker: you know, to charging over a period of years.
[01:13:12] Gavin Baker: Microsoft, it was less dramatic,
[01:13:14] but you know, Microsoft was a tough stock
[01:13:17] Gavin Baker: in the early days of the cloud transition.
[01:13:21] Gavin Baker: Because investors were like, oh my God,
[01:13:22] Gavin Baker: you're an 80% gross margin business.
[01:13:24] Gavin Baker: And the cloud is the 50s and they're like,
[01:13:26] Gavin Baker: well, it's going to be gross profit dollar creative.
[01:13:30] Gavin Baker: It probably will improve those margins over time.
[01:13:32] Gavin Baker: Microsoft, they bought GitHub.
[01:13:34] And they use GitHub as a distribution channel
[01:13:38] for, you know, or co-pilot for coding.
[01:13:42] Gavin Baker: That's becoming a giant business, a giant business.
[01:13:45] Gavin Baker: Now for sure, it runs at much lower gross margins,
[01:13:49] Gavin Baker: but there are so many SaaS companies.
[01:13:52] Gavin Baker: Like I can't think of a single application SaaS company
[01:13:55] Gavin Baker: that could not be running a successful agent strategy.
[01:13:59] Gavin Baker: They have a giant advantage over these AI natives
[01:14:01] Gavin Baker: and that they have a cash journey to business.
[01:14:05] Like, and I think there is room for someone
[01:14:07] Gavin Baker: to be a new kind of activist or constructivist
[01:14:11] Gavin Baker: and just go to SaaS companies and say, stop being so dumb.
[01:14:18] All you have to do is say, here are my AI revenues
[01:14:22] Gavin Baker: and here are my AI gross margins.
[01:14:23] Gavin Baker: And you know it's real AI because it's low gross margins.
[01:14:26] Gavin Baker: I'm going to show you that.
[01:14:27] Gavin Baker: And here's a venture competitor over here
[01:14:30] Gavin Baker: that's losing a lot of money.
[01:14:31] Gavin Baker: So maybe I should take my gross margins to zero for a while.
[01:14:34] Gavin Baker: But I have this business that the venture funded company
[01:14:37] Gavin Baker: doesn't have.
[01:14:38] Gavin Baker: And this is just such a like obvious playbook
[01:14:42] Gavin Baker: that you can run Salesforce, ServiceNow, HubSpot,
[01:14:46] Gavin Baker: GitLab, Atlassian, all of them could run this.
[01:14:50] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And the way that those companies could or should think
[01:14:53] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: about the way to use agents is just to ask the question,
[01:14:57] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: okay, what are the core functions we do for the customer now?
[01:14:59] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Like how can we further automate that
[01:15:01] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: with agents effectively or is it some other stuff?
[01:15:03] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, 100% just like if you're in CRM,
[01:15:05] Gavin Baker: well, what are our customers do?
[01:15:06] Gavin Baker: They talk to their customers.
[01:15:09] Gavin Baker: We're customer relationship management software
[01:15:11] Gavin Baker: and we do some customer support too.
[01:15:13] Gavin Baker: So make an agent that can do that and sell that
[01:15:16] Gavin Baker: at 10 to 20% and let that agent access all the data you have.
[01:15:20] Gavin Baker: Because what's happening right now is another agent,
[01:15:24] another agent made by someone else
[01:15:26] Gavin Baker: is accessing your systems to do this job.
[01:15:29] Gavin Baker: Pulling the data into their system
[01:15:31] Gavin Baker: and then you will eventually be turned off.
[01:15:33] Gavin Baker: It is just crazy and it's just because,
[01:15:36] oh wow, but we want to preserve our 80% gross margins.
[01:15:40] Gavin Baker: This is a life for death decision.
[01:15:42] Gavin Baker: And essentially, everyone except Microsoft is failing it
[01:15:47] Gavin Baker: to quote that bimbo from that Nokia guy long ago.
[01:15:51] Gavin Baker: Like their platforms are burning.
[01:15:52] Gavin Baker: They're new platform, yeah.
[01:15:54] Gavin Baker: There's a really nice platform right over there
[01:15:57] Gavin Baker: and you can just pop to it
[01:15:58] Gavin Baker: and then you can put out the fire in your platform
[01:16:01] Gavin Baker: that's on fire and now you got two platforms and it's great.
[01:16:05] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Your data centers and space thing makes me wonder
[01:16:08] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: if there are other kind of like less discussed off the wall,
[01:16:12] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: things that you're thinking about in the markets in general
[01:16:15] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: that we haven't talked about.
[01:16:16] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: It does feel like since 2020 kicked off in 2022,
[01:16:22] Gavin Baker: punctured this kind of a series of rolling bubbles.
[01:16:26] Gavin Baker: So in 2020, there is a bubble in like EV startup EVs company.
[01:16:30] Gavin Baker: Start up EVs that were not Tesla.
[01:16:32] Gavin Baker: And that's for sure a bubble and they all went down
[01:16:34] Gavin Baker: you know 99% and there was kind of a bubble
[01:16:37] Gavin Baker: and more speculative stocks.
[01:16:40] Gavin Baker: Then we had the meme stocks, game stop.
[01:16:43] And now it feels like the rolling bubble
[01:16:45] Gavin Baker: is in nuclear and quantum.
[01:16:48] Gavin Baker: And these are fusion and SMR.
[01:16:51] Gavin Baker: Like it would be a, it would be a transformative technology.
[01:16:55] Gavin Baker: It's amazing.
[01:16:57] But sadly, from my perspective,
[01:16:59] Gavin Baker: none of the public ways you can invest in this
[01:17:03] Gavin Baker: are really good expressions of this theme
[01:17:05] Gavin Baker: are likely to succeed or have any real fundamental support.
[01:17:08] Gavin Baker: And same thing with quantum.
[01:17:10] Like I've been looking at quantum for 10 years.
[01:17:13] Gavin Baker: We have a really good understanding of quantum.
[01:17:15] Gavin Baker: And the public quantum companies again are not the leaders.
[01:17:19] Gavin Baker: You know, from my perspective,
[01:17:20] Gavin Baker: the leaders in quantum would be Google, IBM
[01:17:23] Gavin Baker: and then the Honeywell quantum.
[01:17:26] Gavin Baker: You know, so the public ways you can invest in this theme,
[01:17:28] Gavin Baker: which probably is exciting, are not the best.
[01:17:30] Gavin Baker: So you have two really clear bubbles.
[01:17:32] Gavin Baker: I also think quantum supremacy is very misunderstood.
[01:17:35] Gavin Baker: People hear it.
[01:17:36] Gavin Baker: And they think that it means that quantum computers
[01:17:38] Gavin Baker: are going to be better than classical computers at everything.
[01:17:41] Gavin Baker: With quantum, you can do some calculations
[01:17:45] Gavin Baker: that classical computers cannot do.
[01:17:49] That's it.
[01:17:49] That's going to be really useful and exciting and awesome.
[01:17:53] Gavin Baker: But it doesn't mean that quantum takes over the world.
[01:17:56] Gavin Baker: The thought that I have had, this is maybe less related
[01:18:02] to markets than just AI.
[01:18:05] Gavin Baker: I have just been fascinated that for the last two years,
[01:18:08] Gavin Baker: whatever AI needs to keep growing and advancing, it gets.
[01:18:17] Have you ever seen public opinion change so fast
[01:18:23] in the United States on any issue has nuclear power?
[01:18:27] Just happen like that.
[01:18:28] Gavin Baker: Like that.
[01:18:31] And like, why did that happen like right when AI needed it to happen?
[01:18:35] Gavin Baker: Now we're running up on boundaries of power and earth, you know?
[01:18:40] Gavin Baker: All of a sudden, data centers in space, you know,
[01:18:43] Gavin Baker: just it's just a little strange to me
[01:18:48] Gavin Baker: that whenever there is something, a bottleneck that might
[01:18:53] Gavin Baker: sew it down, everything accelerates, you know?
[01:18:57] Gavin Baker: Like Rubin is going to be such an easy, seamless transition
[01:19:01] Gavin Baker: relative to Blackwell and Rubin's a great chip.
[01:19:04] Gavin Baker: And then, you know, you have AMD getting into the game
[01:19:07] Gavin Baker: with the MI450.
[01:19:08] Gavin Baker: I get just whatever AI needs, it gets.
[01:19:11] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: You're a deep reader of sci-fi.
[01:19:12] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: So you're making me think of Kevin Kelly's great book,
[01:19:17] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: What Technology Wants.
[01:19:18] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: He comes at the technium like the overall mass of technology
[01:19:22] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: that just like is supplied by humans.
[01:19:24] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Absolutely.
[01:19:25] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And then, you know, I'm more powerful.
[01:19:28] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Yes, it just looks more powerful.
[01:19:30] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Now we're going into an in-state.
[01:19:31] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I have a selfish closing question, speaking of young people.
[01:19:35] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: So my kids were 12 and 10, but especially my son,
[01:19:38] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: who's older, is developing an interest in what I do,
[01:19:41] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: which I think is quite natural.
[01:19:43] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: And I'm going to try to start asking my friends
[01:19:45] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: who are the most passionate about entrepreneurship and investing.
[01:19:48] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Why they are so passionate about it,
[01:19:50] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: and what about it is so interesting and life-giving to them?
[01:19:54] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Which what you've done, the career you built,
[01:19:57] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: this part of the world to a young person that's interested in this.
[01:20:01] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I do believe at some level kind of investing
[01:20:03] Gavin Baker: is the search for truth.
[01:20:05] Gavin Baker: And if you find truth first, and you're right about it being a truth,
[01:20:10] Gavin Baker: that's how you generate alpha, it has to be a truth
[01:20:12] Gavin Baker: that other people don't have not yet seen.
[01:20:15] Gavin Baker: You're searching for hidden truths.
[01:20:17] Gavin Baker: The earliest thing I can remember is being interested in history.
[01:20:22] Gavin Baker: Looking at books with pictures of the Phoenicians,
[01:20:25] Gavin Baker: and the Egyptians, and the Greeks, and the Romans, and pyramids.
[01:20:29] Gavin Baker: I loved history.
[01:20:31] I vividly remember, I think in the second grade,
[01:20:35] Gavin Baker: has my dad drove me to school every day.
[01:20:37] Gavin Baker: We went through the whole history of World War II in one year.
[01:20:41] Gavin Baker: And I love that.
[01:20:43] And then that translated into a real interest
[01:20:47] Gavin Baker: in current events very early.
[01:20:49] Gavin Baker: So like, has a pretty young person.
[01:20:52] Gavin Baker: I don't know if it was eighth grade or seventh grade or ninth grade.
[01:20:55] Gavin Baker: Like I was reading The New York Times and The Washington Post,
[01:20:59] Gavin Baker: and I would get so excited when the mail came,
[01:21:03] Gavin Baker: because it made that maybe there was an economist,
[01:21:05] Gavin Baker: or a newsweek, or a timer, a US news,
[01:21:07] Gavin Baker: and I was really into current events.
[01:21:10] Gavin Baker: Because current events is kind of like applied history
[01:21:12] Gavin Baker: and watching history happen.
[01:21:14] Gavin Baker: And like thinking about what might happen next.
[01:21:17] And I didn't know anything about investing
[01:21:21] Gavin Baker: by parents or both of turties.
[01:21:23] Gavin Baker: Anytime I wanted to argue, but I was super rewarded.
[01:21:27] Gavin Baker: I could make a reasonable argument why I should stay up late.
[01:21:30] Gavin Baker: My parents would be so proud of it.
[01:21:31] Gavin Baker: They'd let me stay up late.
[01:21:32] Gavin Baker: I had to beat them.
[01:21:34] Gavin Baker: Like I was just kind of going through life,
[01:21:35] Gavin Baker: and I really loved to ski, and I love rock climbing.
[01:21:38] Gavin Baker: And I go to college, and rock climbing is,
[01:21:41] Gavin Baker: by far the most important thing in my life,
[01:21:43] Gavin Baker: I dedicated myself to it completely.
[01:21:45] Gavin Baker: I did all my homework at the gym.
[01:21:47] Gavin Baker: I got to the rock climbing gym, like at 7am,
[01:21:51] Gavin Baker: would skip a lot of classes to stay in the gym.
[01:21:53] Gavin Baker: I do my homework on like a big bouldering mat.
[01:21:57] Like every weekend I went and climbed somewhere
[01:21:59] Gavin Baker: with the Dartmouth Mountain Earing Club.
[01:22:01] Gavin Baker: And as part of that, like on Clivey trips,
[01:22:03] you know, maybe we'd play poker.
[01:22:05] Gavin Baker: The movie routers keep out while I was in college.
[01:22:07] Gavin Baker: We started to play poker.
[01:22:08] Gavin Baker: I like to play chess, but I was never that good at chess
[01:22:12] Gavin Baker: or poker.
[01:22:13] Gavin Baker: You never really dedicated myself to either.
[01:22:15] Gavin Baker: And my plan, like you know, after two or three years
[01:22:17] Gavin Baker: of college was I was going to leave.
[01:22:20] Gavin Baker: I was going to work as a, I was a ski bum at Alton College.
[01:22:24] Gavin Baker: I was a housekeeper.
[01:22:25] Gavin Baker: I've cleaned a lot of toilets.
[01:22:28] Gavin Baker: It was shocking to me how people treated me.
[01:22:31] Gavin Baker: And it is like permanently impacted how I treat other people.
[01:22:34] Gavin Baker: You know, like I want, you know, like you'd be cleaning
[01:22:38] Gavin Baker: somebody's room and they'd be in it.
[01:22:39] Gavin Baker: And they'd be reading the same book as you.
[01:22:41] Gavin Baker: And like, you know, you'd say, oh, that's a great book,
[01:22:43] Gavin Baker: you know, I'm about where you are.
[01:22:45] Gavin Baker: And they look at you like you were basically,
[01:22:48] Gavin Baker: like you speak.
[01:22:50] Gavin Baker: And then they get even more shocked.
[01:22:52] Gavin Baker: You read, you know, so it like had a big impact on how I've
[01:22:56] Gavin Baker: like just treated everyone since then.
[01:22:58] Gavin Baker: But anyways, I was going to be a ski bum in the winters.
[01:23:01] Gavin Baker: I was going to work on a river in the, in the summers.
[01:23:04] Gavin Baker: And that was how I was going to support myself.
[01:23:05] Gavin Baker: And then I was going to climb in the shoulder seasons,
[01:23:08] Gavin Baker: going to try and be a wildlife photographer
[01:23:10] Gavin Baker: and write the next great American novel.
[01:23:11] Gavin Baker: I can't believe I knew this.
[01:23:12] Gavin Baker: That was my plan.
[01:23:13] Gavin Baker: This was like my plan of record.
[01:23:15] Gavin Baker: I was really lucky.
[01:23:16] Gavin Baker: My parents, very supportive of everything I wanted to do.
[01:23:19] Gavin Baker: My parents had very strict parents.
[01:23:20] Gavin Baker: So of course they were extremely permissive with me.
[01:23:22] Gavin Baker: So, you know, I'll probably end up being a strict parent
[01:23:25] Gavin Baker: just the cycle continues.
[01:23:27] Gavin Baker: My parents were lawyers, you know, they, they, they had done
[01:23:29] Gavin Baker: reasonably well.
[01:23:30] Gavin Baker: They both grew up in, and I would say very economically
[01:23:33] Gavin Baker: disadvantaged circumstances.
[01:23:35] Gavin Baker: You know, like my dad talks about like he remembers every person
[01:23:39] Gavin Baker: who bought him a beer.
[01:23:40] Gavin Baker: Just because he could not, he couldn't afford a beer.
[01:23:43] Gavin Baker: You know, he worked the whole way through college.
[01:23:44] Gavin Baker: He was there on a scholarship.
[01:23:46] Gavin Baker: You know, he had one pair of shoes all through high school.
[01:23:49] Gavin Baker: But anyways, and so they were super on board with this plan.
[01:23:51] Gavin Baker: And I'd been very lucky.
[01:23:53] Gavin Baker: They sent me to college, and I didn't have to pay
[01:23:55] Gavin Baker: to pay for college.
[01:23:55] Gavin Baker: I paid for my college education.
[01:23:57] Gavin Baker: They said, you know, Gavin, we think this plan
[01:23:59] Gavin Baker: of being, you know, a ski bum, river-afty guide,
[01:24:02] Gavin Baker: wildlife photographer climbing the shoulder seasons,
[01:24:05] Gavin Baker: tried to write it all, but we think it sounds like a great plan.
[01:24:07] Gavin Baker: But you know, we've never asked you for anything.
[01:24:09] Gavin Baker: We've, have it encouraged you to study anything.
[01:24:11] Gavin Baker: We've supported you and everything you've wanted to do.
[01:24:13] Gavin Baker: Will you please get one professional internship?
[01:24:17] Gavin Baker: Just one.
[01:24:17] Gavin Baker: And we don't care what it is.
[01:24:19] Gavin Baker: The only internship I could get,
[01:24:21] Gavin Baker: this was at the end of myself, our summer at Dartmouth,
[01:24:23] Gavin Baker: was an internship with Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jean-Rat, DLJ.
[01:24:27] Gavin Baker: My job was to, every time DLJ published a research report,
[01:24:31] Gavin Baker: it was in like the Private Wealth Management Division.
[01:24:33] Gavin Baker: And I worked for the guy who ran the office.
[01:24:36] Gavin Baker: And my job was whenever they produced a piece of research,
[01:24:40] Gavin Baker: I would go through and look at which of his clients
[01:24:42] Gavin Baker: owned that stock, then I would put the research,
[01:24:46] Gavin Baker: I would mail it to the clients.
[01:24:48] Gavin Baker: You know, so this day, we wrote on General Electric.
[01:24:51] Gavin Baker: So I need to mail the GE report to these 30 people.
[01:24:54] Gavin Baker: And then I need to email the Cisco report to these 20 people.
[01:24:58] Gavin Baker: And then I started like reading the reports.
[01:24:59] Gavin Baker: And I was like, oh my God,
[01:25:01] Gavin Baker: this is like the most interesting thing imaginable.
[01:25:04] Gavin Baker: Investing, I kind of conceptualized it.
[01:25:06] Gavin Baker: It's a game of skill and chance, kind of like something like poker.
[01:25:10] Gavin Baker: And there's obviously chance in investing.
[01:25:13] Gavin Baker: You know, like if you're an investor in a company
[01:25:14] Gavin Baker: and a meteor hits their headquarters,
[01:25:16] Gavin Baker: like that's bad luck, but like you own that outcome.
[01:25:21] Gavin Baker: So there is chance that is irreducible,
[01:25:24] Gavin Baker: but there's skill too, but so that really appealed to me.
[01:25:26] Gavin Baker: And the way you got an edge in this,
[01:25:29] Gavin Baker: the greatest game of skill and chance imaginable
[01:25:32] Gavin Baker: was you had the most thorough knowledge possible of history.
[01:25:38] And you intersected that with the most accurate
[01:25:41] Gavin Baker: understanding of current events in the world
[01:25:44] Gavin Baker: to form a differential opinion on what was going to happen next
[01:25:48] Gavin Baker: in this game of skill and chance,
[01:25:49] Gavin Baker: which stock is mispriced in the peri-mutual system
[01:25:52] Gavin Baker: that is the stock market.
[01:25:54] Gavin Baker: And that was like day three.
[01:25:57] Gavin Baker: I went to the bookstore and I bought like the books
[01:26:00] Gavin Baker: that they had, which are Peter Lynch's books.
[01:26:02] Gavin Baker: I read those books in like two days.
[01:26:04] Gavin Baker: I'm a very fast reader.
[01:26:05] Gavin Baker: And then I read all these books about Warren Buffett.
[01:26:09] Then I read Market Wizards.
[01:26:10] Gavin Baker: Then I read Warren Buffett's Letters to a Shareholders.
[01:26:13] Gavin Baker: This is like during my internship.
[01:26:16] Gavin Baker: Then I read Warren Buffett's Letters to a Shareholders again.
[01:26:18] Gavin Baker: Then I taught myself accounting.
[01:26:20] Gavin Baker: There's this great book by Stocks Go Up and Down.
[01:26:22] Gavin Baker: Then I went back to school.
[01:26:23] Gavin Baker: I changed my majors from English and History
[01:26:25] Gavin Baker: to History and Economics.
[01:26:26] Gavin Baker: And I never looked back.
[01:26:28] Gavin Baker: And it consumed like I continued to really focus on climbing.
[01:26:33] Gavin Baker: I would be in the gym and I would print out everything
[01:26:36] Gavin Baker: that the people on the Motley Fool wrote.
[01:26:39] Gavin Baker: They had these fools.
[01:26:41] Gavin Baker: And they were early to talk about return on an invested capital.
[01:26:45] Gavin Baker: And incremental ROIC is like a really important indicator.
[01:26:50] Gavin Baker: And I would just read it and I would underline it.
[01:26:52] Gavin Baker: And I'd read books.
[01:26:53] Gavin Baker: And then I'd read the Wall Street Journal.
[01:26:54] Gavin Baker: And then eventually there was a computer
[01:26:56] Gavin Baker: of terminal finally set up near the gym.
[01:26:58] Gavin Baker: And I'd go to that gym and just read news about Stocks.
[01:27:01] Gavin Baker: It was the most important thing in my life.
[01:27:03] Gavin Baker: And like I barely kept my grades up.
[01:27:05] Gavin Baker: And yeah, that's how I got into it, man.
[01:27:06] Gavin Baker: History, current events, skill and chance.
[01:27:09] Gavin Baker: And I am a competitive person.
[01:27:12] And I've actually never been good at anything else.
[01:27:15] Gavin Baker: I got picked last for every sports team.
[01:27:18] Gavin Baker: Like I love to ski.
[01:27:19] Gavin Baker: I've literally spent a small fortune, a private ski lessons.
[01:27:23] Gavin Baker: I'm not that good of a skier.
[01:27:24] Gavin Baker: I like to play ping pong.
[01:27:26] All my friends can beat me.
[01:27:29] Gavin Baker: I tried to get really good at chess.
[01:27:30] Gavin Baker: This was before, you know,
[01:27:32] Gavin Baker: when you actually had to play the games,
[01:27:34] Gavin Baker: it was before I was easy to do it on the phone.
[01:27:37] Gavin Baker: And my goal was to beat one of the people.
[01:27:39] Gavin Baker: I'm sure there's a park somewhere.
[01:27:40] Gavin Baker: That's literally right there.
[01:27:41] Gavin Baker: Oh, there's right there.
[01:27:42] Gavin Baker: It's right there.
[01:27:43] Gavin Baker: Okay, well, there's water Cambridge.
[01:27:44] Gavin Baker: And I wanted to beat one of them.
[01:27:45] Gavin Baker: Never beat one of them.
[01:27:46] Gavin Baker: Never been good at anything.
[01:27:47] Gavin Baker: I thought I would be good at this.
[01:27:50] Gavin Baker: And the idea of being good at something
[01:27:52] Gavin Baker: other than taking a test that was competitive
[01:27:57] Gavin Baker: was very appealing to me.
[01:27:59] And so I think that's been a really important thing too.
[01:28:01] Gavin Baker: And to this day, this is the only thing
[01:28:03] Gavin Baker: I've been vaguely competitive at.
[01:28:05] Gavin Baker: I'd love to be good at something else.
[01:28:07] Gavin Baker: I'm just not.
[01:28:08] Gavin Baker: You know, I think I'm gonna start asking
[01:28:10] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: this question of everybody.
[01:28:12] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: The ongoing education of Pearson Maeve,
[01:28:13] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: amazing place to close.
[01:28:15] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: I love talking about everything.
[01:28:16] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Thank you so much.
[01:28:17] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: This is great, man.
[01:28:18] Patrick O'Shaughnessy: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
