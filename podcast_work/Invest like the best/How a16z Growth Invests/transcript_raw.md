[00:00:00] One of the elements of people judgment is what is the right founder for the right market.
[00:00:05] SPEAKER_01: I really like a certain archetype of founder. I call them the technical terminator.
[00:00:09] SPEAKER_01: The thing that I like about these technical terminators is they start technical and then you never
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_01: know if these people are going to become commercially minded, excellent, you know, sort of business people.
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_01: And then over time they learn the business side.
[00:00:30] I think early stage investors can often give you an interesting opinion about what the distant
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_00: future looks like. Probably great growth stage investors like you can give a really interesting
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_00: view on what the near to medium term future looks like. The companies that you've backed are sort
[00:00:52] SPEAKER_00: of a who's who of leaders across different technology sectors. If you had to think like three to
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_00: five years out, what are some of the most interesting ways you think the future will be different
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_00: than the present based on your experience with the companies that you've backed?
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_00: Obviously the big topic that we're tackling and trying to figure out in the near future is the
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_01: impact of AI. We've backed a ton of really exciting companies at every layer of the stack.
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_01: And we can talk about that and you know that's been part of our strategy, you know, from the model
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_01: layer infrastructure and tools, applications. I would break it apart into what a consumer's doing
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_01: what enterprises do in the AI world. And then I have a bunch of views on how the world's going to
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_01: be different as it relates to American dynamism, you know, hardware plus software robotics, autonomy,
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_01: stuff like that. On the AI side for consumers, I think we need to be really humble about where we are
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_01: right now. But I don't think that we have yet found the dominant in AI. We may have the dominant
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_01: brand and you know, open AI and chat to PT is growing faster than anything in the history of
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_01: technology. You know, I think they reach the same scale as Google, something like four times faster,
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_01: you know, billion people using it. And they're only monetizing a tiny piece of that, which I think
[00:02:02] SPEAKER_01: is a really exciting dynamic. But I don't think that the future of how we interact with AI is going
[00:02:08] SPEAKER_01: to be a chat pot. Like I just think that's way too limiting. I think the big shift will be a sort of
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_01: what is reactive today to something that's proactive in the future. And chat,
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_01: GPD maybe able to capture that. And I think they probably have the best chance of doing so. But I think
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_01: the way that we interact with all this stuff is going to change dramatically. It's going to have
[00:02:29] SPEAKER_01: long-form memory. It's going to be multimodal. And it's going to be proactive. It's going to offer us,
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_01: you know, solutions and how we do things. So I'm super excited about that. But I think the open-ended
[00:02:39] SPEAKER_01: upside of what companies can capture in economics from that is kind of endless in size. You know,
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_01: I like to look at history of consumer internet companies and what were our perceptions and then
[00:02:52] SPEAKER_01: what actually ended up happening in reality. So I think it's instructive to look back at Facebook
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_01: and Google. And I remember when we were in the private markets looking at investments and things
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_01: like Snap and Twitter, you know, 10 plus years ago. And we would always sit and say, well, yeah,
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_01: but Facebook and Google only monetize at X certain amount. And you know, all the consumer internet
[00:03:13] SPEAKER_01: businesses are sort of P times Q businesses. And you know, the P is, you know,
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_01: quantity has ended up being billions of users kind of took two and a half, two and a half billion
[00:03:22] SPEAKER_01: users or more in each case. But we always said, oh, you know, Facebook or Google, they make 20 bucks
[00:03:27] SPEAKER_01: a user. So like that's kind of the upper bound. And fast forward 10 years later, and Facebook and
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_01: Google make like 200 bucks a user in the developed world. And so when we look at things like chat
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_01: GPT, it's really fun to think about this. It's like, okay, how much time do people spend?
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_01: What kind of value do they get? How much consumer surplus is there? And how do we think about valuing
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_01: that? And it's pretty open ended, which is, which is really exciting right now. So the really
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_01: interesting thing is, you know, if you look at chat GPT and consumer stuff, there's like a billion
[00:03:58] SPEAKER_01: users, they monetize less than 50 million of them. And how will they monetize the rest?
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_01: That's a really fun problem to try to tackle. I think it's hard to describe, but it will be,
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_01: I think it'll be some form of like an affiliate thing that happens. It's like a new native thing.
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_01: Like it's the thing I always say to people is, you know, we again, we got to be humble in how we
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_01: think about this. We never would have predicted what a feed-based advertisement is. Like no one would
[00:04:26] have known what that is, because we didn't even know what the feed-based product was. It turns out,
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_01: it's probably the best advertisement format in history. Like it's really, really compelling.
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_01: And so it's not surprising that it monetized this really high. And people actually really like it.
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_01: Like I really like Instagram ads. So, you know, a year ago, this sort of light bulb went off for me.
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_01: Maybe it's six months ago. I did deep research on, you'll probably relate to this, a new baseball
[00:04:53] SPEAKER_01: bat for my son. And so, you know, he's nine years old. And it's pretty complicated. It's like,
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_01: okay, it needs to be a certain length and drop and all these certain specifications. And, you know,
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_01: there's there's this year's version and last year's version. And if I had to do that on Google,
[00:05:08] SPEAKER_01: like it would be a total mess. Like I would struggle with it. Amazon, no chance because of the ads.
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_01: Deep research was really, really, really good at it. And it kind of solved my problem for me.
[00:05:20] And so light bulb kind of went off for me at that moment. One, the models are going to get so much
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_01: better. And two, to me, it's sort of an execution problem of building the capabilities to go
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_01: execute that stuff on your behalf on the web. And so, I think that's a really exciting future.
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_01: There's going to need to be tons of guardrails built into it. You got to build a ton of product
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_01: and piping to do so. It's really hard. You know, Instagram famously tried to do shopping kind of
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_01: natively. And it's just too hardly. But I think that's a pretty exciting future. And shopping is
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_01: just one category. So, you know, if I take a step back and I think about AI, today really active
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_01: users spend almost 30 minutes a day in the products. Like for context, users spend like 50 minutes a day
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_01: on Instagram, like 70 minutes a day on TikTok. They're monetizing only a slight few of them today.
[00:06:10] Consumers get a ton of value. There's going to be a ton of consumer surplus available. And I think
[00:06:15] SPEAKER_01: that could lend itself to the creation of a huge company, the massive company. And again, I think
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_01: Chad Geltese in a lead today, but it's early in that specific area of the world, the sort of
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_00: pure AI part of the world. Where do you feel the most different than your peers in what you think
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_00: matters, what you think's exciting or not exciting? Where do you have, like, where do you feel most
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_00: divergent? I feel like I'm probably reasonably consensus on the excitement of the consumer side.
[00:06:42] SPEAKER_01: I can put it into context around the sort of upside around price that you get on the P times Q,
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_01: especially if time spent continues to go up, which I think it wills the models get better and they
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_01: have memory and things like that. I think on the enterprise side, one of the lessons I learned
[00:06:58] SPEAKER_01: from SaaS and Cloud, which by the way, the advancements of SaaS and Cloud are tiny compared to the
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_01: advancements of what AI is going to do is I think maybe a little bit more expansively on what the
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_01: companies can become on the enterprise side. But maybe I'm slightly more skeptical about what
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_01: their ultimate business models will be. So one of the really fun topics that people debate with
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_01: high degrees of confidence that I have very low confidence in is what is the ultimate business
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_01: models of these companies? And people put up these super compelling slides that are like, hey,
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_01: the whole software industry is only whatever, $400 billion. But look at how big white-collar labor is.
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_01: And we're going to go get a ton of that. And to me, that's like a little bit hand wavy. So
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_01: there's a couple of areas where the business model has progressed in a compelling way to go
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_01: tackle that directly. So customer support is one. But because there's a very discrete task with
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_01: very simple completion analysis that you can do, it's kind of simple to price it on that. Like,
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_01: you can shift the business model from a seat-based thing for Zendesk or something to a new business
[00:08:11] SPEAKER_01: model where if you successfully complete the task, you can charge on that. You know it's worth.
[00:08:17] Maybe the next furthest developed area is coding. But it's not completion of a task. It's
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_01: consumption driven. And especially in the developer world, that whole world is used to plant
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_01: things on consumption. Like, it's kind of how it has all shifted over the last 10 years.
[00:08:32] Everything else, I think, is pretty TBD. It's going to be very hard. And I think
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_01: when you see major technological shifts, it's very tempting to say, oh my gosh, there is so much
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_01: economic value that all these companies are going to capture top down. The reality of doing it is
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_01: much harder. And I always say to people like 90% of the technological surplus is going to go to
[00:08:59] SPEAKER_01: the end users. Like, just start with that as the assumption, whether it's consumer, whether it's
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_01: enterprise, you know, like a funny analogy that I heard from somebody else is, you know, how
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_01: is this steam engine ultimately priced? Like, it wasn't priced based on replacing like 50 laborers.
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_01: The competitive forces drove it to a certain price where there was an appropriate return on capital.
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_01: But the vast majority of those productivity gains went to the end users of those machines,
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_01: not the maker of the machines. And so, I think something similar will probably happen in the
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_01: enterprise. Even with that, you can create the biggest businesses in the world. So, you know,
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_01: an analogy would be Apple, right? Like, what would you pay for your iPhone?
[00:09:41] I mean, yeah, this guy's the limit. Like, 90% consumer surplus is probably low. You know,
[00:09:47] SPEAKER_01: if the iPhone calls a thousand bucks or something like that. So, you know, I'd say the same for Google,
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_01: I'd say the same for Facebook, it's going to happen in consumer. Consumers are going to be the
[00:09:55] SPEAKER_01: ones who realize the surplus. The same is going to happen in business. But I think the next generation
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_01: business companies can still be much bigger than the previous generation of companies given the
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_01: capability gains. When I last ran into a couple of years ago in person in San Francisco, we were talking
[00:10:08] SPEAKER_00: about Waymo. And you were sort of in the mode of like intensely studying that company and thinking
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_00: about it, which makes me very interested in this class of companies where you heard about Waymo
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_00: and self-driving as a service for a really, really long time with sort of nothing happening.
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_00: And then all of a sudden, you know, last time I was in San Francisco a couple weeks ago,
[00:10:26] SPEAKER_00: it's just every other car. And the explosive nature of Waymo as an example is really cool to watch.
[00:10:33] SPEAKER_00: There's all these other technologies you might call them American dynamism and
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_00: Indra's and Horowitz, whether that's robotics or, you know, small modular reactors or like really
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_00: exciting big technology ideas, which are, you understand the potential like if we had an in-home
[00:10:46] SPEAKER_00: robot that'd be awesome, but it's really hard to figure out how long it will take, maybe similar to
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_00: how long Waymo took or something. How do you think about investing in those kinds of companies where
[00:10:57] SPEAKER_00: it's incredibly exciting, clearly if we had it and it worked, it would be really valuable,
[00:11:01] SPEAKER_00: but it's really hard to know how long it's going to take to work.
[00:11:05] It's often these are the ones that are the biggest market opportunity.
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_01: Like robotics is the biggest market opportunity. Like we were all obsessed with
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_01: LLM. Yeah, if you knew it was going to work in five years, you put all your money into it.
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_01: I happen to think it will take a little bit longer. Part of that is informed by my experience with Waymo.
[00:11:24] You know, if you think like I'd contrast maybe what Waymo does and you know,
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_01: increasingly Tesla and some others with what a robot needs to do and it's very different.
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_01: You know, a car needs to basically stay in a lane, avoid anomalies, collisions, go a certain speed
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_01: limit, find places to park. It's not simple. When I describe it that way, it's more complicated than
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_01: that, but simply put, that's kind of what it has to do. I contrast that with what a robot has to do.
[00:11:56] SPEAKER_01: What does a robot have to do in your home? Inless degrees of freedom. Make a cup of coffee,
[00:12:03] SPEAKER_01: go do my laundry, but it took Waymo 10 years and if you go back to the DARPA challenge,
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_01: like the whole industry, you know, decades to get to this point, two decades to get to this point
[00:12:15] SPEAKER_01: roughly. And so my expectation is technology is advanced. Obviously the general AI techniques can
[00:12:22] SPEAKER_01: be applied to robotics to help it go much faster, but I think it's going to take a long time.
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_01: So how do you invest in that? We have an early stage team that is studying all the robotics
[00:12:30] SPEAKER_01: companies. We meet them all. We're learning a ton. We're waiting for them to find, you know,
[00:12:34] SPEAKER_01: the team that they can do an early stage traditional kind of seed or series A investment in. And then
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_01: at the growth stage, ideally they find that and we can invest in it. Or one of these companies that
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_01: were not investors in really starts to work. And you know, we've debated, what does it, what does it
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_01: mean to work? I think we'll know it when we see it, you know, like there will be things that start
[00:12:56] SPEAKER_01: happening and customers pulling their products that we will have not seen before. What's the lesson
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_00: from Waymo there on what it means to start to work? Like what do you think in the history of Waymo
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_00: was the point at which you would have said, okay, now like something happened and that makes this
[00:13:10] SPEAKER_00: more investable. So the interesting thing about Waymo for us, I'll tell you the history of our
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_01: Waymo investment. We originally invested in 2020 in Waymo. They came to us to raise outside
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_01: capital for the first time. So it's just purely funded by Google over time. They thought it would be
[00:13:25] SPEAKER_01: helpful for employees for hiring all that stuff, outside council, all that, diversify the cap table
[00:13:32] SPEAKER_01: to bring on some outside investors. So some folks invested in, we're the only VC firm that
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_01: invested in it. We invested out of our first growth fund. And it was really fun because I
[00:13:43] SPEAKER_01: guess they're seeing the future. Like taking the ride in 2019, it was doing some pretty amazing
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_01: stuff in retrospect. You know, it could do unprotected left. It could avoid construction sites. And
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_01: the thing it didn't know how to do it actually was like park, you know, we got to a parking lot and
[00:13:58] SPEAKER_01: kind of like stalled and, you know, we had to override and go drive up to the front. But you could
[00:14:03] SPEAKER_01: see signs that it was going to be pretty interesting. But it wasn't on the road. You know, we knew
[00:14:09] SPEAKER_01: they were going to be conservative about rolling it out. So Mark and Ben came to me and they said,
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_01: hey, you know, we got to do this Waymo investment. And I said, I know, like I don't like this at all.
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_01: Like this is crazy. It's going to take 10 years. You know, the valuation that we come in at is
[00:14:29] SPEAKER_01: going to be really high. And they said, you know what? Don't care. Like this is autonomous driving.
[00:14:36] SPEAKER_01: Like, are you kidding me? This is the mother of all markets. Like if they have the thing that can
[00:14:40] SPEAKER_01: drive cars autonomously, it's going to be worth a ton. Like stop overthinking it. And you know,
[00:14:44] SPEAKER_01: my team, we had built all this analysis and why, you know, it would take forever and the economics
[00:14:48] SPEAKER_01: were going to be strained. And so we compromised and we made a small investment in Waymo at the time.
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_01: And I was excited to be a part of it. I just, I thought the returns would be stretched.
[00:14:59] Fast forward five years later, at the end of 2024, they raised money again. And at the end of 2024,
[00:15:05] SPEAKER_01: they had cars on the road. And it turned out you, to your question, consumer preference slapped you
[00:15:13] SPEAKER_01: in the face. Like anyone who was in San Francisco who had the choice was taken away. But at that time,
[00:15:20] SPEAKER_01: we had the chance to invest more money, you know, and it was working. We took that opportunity to
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_01: write a much larger check and invest. By the way, one of the really interesting things about Waymo,
[00:15:29] SPEAKER_01: so you said you see it, you're in San Francisco, you see it everywhere. How many cars do you think
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_01: they have on the road in San Francisco? Because they're everywhere, right? Like everywhere you turn,
[00:15:37] SPEAKER_01: you see them. And a thousand. They have like 400. Wow. Yeah. So it turns out if your cars are
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_01: driving optimal routes and sort of fully utilized and not running into some of the problems that drivers
[00:15:53] SPEAKER_01: have, like it's pretty good. And so you can have a lot of coverage. There are something like 50,000
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_01: lift drivers in the San Francisco Bay Area. And Waymo overtook them in market share.
[00:16:03] SPEAKER_01: It feels like the appropriate time to disclose that you and I went to college together. The reason I
[00:16:08] SPEAKER_00: mentioned that is usually when we get together, we don't jump into talking about investing,
[00:16:12] SPEAKER_00: stuff, which makes me realize, I don't think I've ever actually asked you like, what is your
[00:16:17] SPEAKER_00: investment like philosophy or strategy or style or taste? Like, what is it and how did it develop?
[00:16:25] SPEAKER_01: My style and taste is very much, if I were summarizing one line, I like to pay fair prices
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_01: for great companies. Like everyone would say they would like to do that, right? The art in that
[00:16:42] SPEAKER_01: I think is recognizing where greatness may lie, where other people don't recognize that. And so
[00:16:51] on price greatness, it's priced but not to the fullest extent, right? And so I've studied
[00:16:58] SPEAKER_01: the history of technology companies and why they outperform and how they outperform.
[00:17:02] SPEAKER_01: Often in growth stage investing, it's always on the growth side. It's like, hey, the growth side
[00:17:08] SPEAKER_01: is where you get things really right. I tell the team that, it's like we can make a lot of mistakes
[00:17:13] SPEAKER_01: on forecasting margins and business models and unit economics and all that stuff but lots of people
[00:17:18] SPEAKER_01: know how to do that analysis. That's out there. So where can you actually get edge? You can get
[00:17:23] SPEAKER_01: edge from product insights, market insights and people insights. And so how do we maximize our
[00:17:31] SPEAKER_01: likelihood of doing that? On the people side, I'll start there because that's probably the hardest
[00:17:37] SPEAKER_01: to do and I've gotten it right a number of times and I think I have reasonably good taste in people.
[00:17:43] SPEAKER_01: Like I really like a certain archetype of founder. I call them the technical terminator.
[00:17:48] SPEAKER_01: I'm very close with with Ali from Databricks. Ali is the technical terminator. Like he
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_01: self evident. It's self evident. It wasn't self evident, you know, all along. He actually was
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_01: even CEO. You know, he became CEO later. He started the open source project. Yeah, he was one of seven,
[00:18:04] SPEAKER_01: one of seven. And so he was not the CEO. There was a much more established guy who we've partnered
[00:18:11] SPEAKER_01: with on a lot of companies. He's been a co founder of a lot of companies, great companies have come
[00:18:14] SPEAKER_01: out of his lab, Yon Stoica and Berkeley. So the thing that I like about these technical terminators
[00:18:20] is they start technical and then you never know if these people are going to become commercially
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_01: excellent, you know, sort of business people. And so you have the grounding, you have the products,
[00:18:35] SPEAKER_01: those are the people that are likely to figure out the next product area because they're technical
[00:18:39] SPEAKER_01: because they're in the products. You know, Mark Zuckerberg is an example of this. E-Lines,
[00:18:43] SPEAKER_01: a great example of this. And then over time they learn the business side. So it's been so fun
[00:18:49] SPEAKER_01: to work with Ali because he knows more about like sales ops and hiring processes and reporting
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_01: lines and all these things you have to do as a manager than probably any of our CEOs. But he
[00:19:01] SPEAKER_01: learned about like he's just been a sponsor. You have a favorite counter example to the technical
[00:19:05] SPEAKER_00: terminator like somebody that is completely non technical. Travis. Okay, interesting. Yeah, Uber.
[00:19:10] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. So one of the elements of people judgment is what is the right founder for the right market,
[00:19:18] SPEAKER_01: right? And that market was just a pure battle. Like it was like you need to fight. Yeah, like you
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_01: fight mayors, you fight competitors. And by the way, there were competitors like, you know,
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_01: and so you just needed to be ruthlessly competitive and driven and operationally intense. And you
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_01: know, that's he's the perfect counter sample to that. And we were I was an investor in Uber at GA.
[00:19:44] SPEAKER_01: And you know, he's the archetype. But there's a lot more of these technical ones that become
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_01: great business people in my life. You know, George Kurtz from CrowdStrike is a great example of it.
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_01: I'll tell you one more example, which is not as obvious Dave from Roblox. You know, when we met him,
[00:20:00] SPEAKER_01: I met him, you know, maybe 10 years ago or something in early days of whether it was actually kind of
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_01: working. And he was technically brilliant and he was so deep in the product. And you know, he's
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_01: the kind of guy that on the surface, if you didn't really know him well, you would kind of be like,
[00:20:15] SPEAKER_01: oh, is he a little bit, he's a little quieter. And it turns out like he's ruthlessly competitive.
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_01: And he really cares about market cap creation and like his stock price going up and for the right
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_01: reasons, you know, Dylan from Figma is a great example of this. Like he's so nice. He's one of the
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_01: nicest guys in our industry. But he is brutally ruthlessly competitive. The new AI guys and women,
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_01: like it's been really fun to see them develop this. Michael from Curcer, Shiv from a bridge,
[00:20:46] SPEAKER_01: was practically practicing cardiologist who has then shifted his attention to, you know,
[00:20:52] SPEAKER_01: building a technology company. He lives in Pittsburgh and he commutes to New York to work most
[00:20:58] SPEAKER_01: of the time. And I was with him in the office the other day and he said, you know, he's showing me
[00:21:03] the office. I'm like, oh, yeah, cool. That's great. That's nice. He's like, I'm going to put a bet
[00:21:07] SPEAKER_01: over there. I'm going to start sleeping in there. I'm like, man, you're like a doctor with kids
[00:21:13] SPEAKER_01: and stuff. And he's like, no, no, I just want to, I want to be working all the time when I'm in town.
[00:21:17] SPEAKER_01: So, you know, I love that sort of relentlessness and intensity paired with, you know, technological
[00:21:24] SPEAKER_01: capabilities, product understanding. And, you know, backing people like that, they're going to,
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_01: like pour everything they have into winning. But they're also more likely to figure out the next
[00:21:36] SPEAKER_01: things and navigate complex markets and changing environments. I had access to your entire calendar
[00:21:41] SPEAKER_00: for the last five years or something and saw all the companies and the debates where you ultimately
[00:21:46] SPEAKER_00: didn't invest but almost did. What would I learn from like that batch of companies and founders?
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_00: This is a very humbling job because we make so many mistakes. Errors of commission are really painful,
[00:21:57] SPEAKER_01: errors of omission are really, really painful too. And they're more costly just economically because
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_01: you can lose one times your money if you get things wrong and an error of commission. But you can
[00:22:10] SPEAKER_01: forego making really high returns if you get it wrong. There are no common patterns. I would say
[00:22:17] SPEAKER_01: when we get it right on not doing an investment, it's typically for the right reasons. It's
[00:22:25] typically because we see something that we don't love about the business quality. You know,
[00:22:28] SPEAKER_01: we feel really, really, really strongly about market leadership. Do you know the Glen Gary Glen
[00:22:33] SPEAKER_01: Ross movie? Yeah, another movie. You know the scene with Alec Baldwin. We refresh our memories.
[00:22:38] SPEAKER_00: Okay, so Alec Baldwin comes in. There's the scene with Alec Baldwin where he's running like a sales
[00:22:44] SPEAKER_01: contest. It's like a boiler room setting and he comes in and he's running a sales contest and he
[00:22:50] SPEAKER_01: walks in and he's like, okay, guys, new contest. Here we go. First prize gets Cadillac. Second prize
[00:22:56] SPEAKER_01: gets set of steak knives. Third prize or fired. And so we've adopted that as a way of describing
[00:23:02] SPEAKER_01: most of the technology markets that we live in. So we happen to think and I happen to think strongly
[00:23:08] SPEAKER_01: and my experience has been the vast majority of market cap creation is going to go to the market
[00:23:12] SPEAKER_01: leader. And this is probably underappreciated. Like we see this all the time with our peers in the
[00:23:17] SPEAKER_01: in the growth investing industry where they say things like, yeah, you know, even the number two
[00:23:21] SPEAKER_01: player, like it's going to be really viable. Like maybe, but like more often than not, that's not
[00:23:26] SPEAKER_01: the case. That's kind of obvious in network factor of businesses, consumer and companies,
[00:23:30] SPEAKER_01: Google, Facebook, etc. It's it's less obvious in enterprise companies, but it happens just as often.
[00:23:38] SPEAKER_01: Like there's no number two to Salesforce. Like Salesforce is Salesforce. Work day is work day.
[00:23:43] SPEAKER_01: Service now is service now. Like you and you'd feel a lot of pain if you did the number two or you
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_01: got forbid the number three in those markets. In early days of technological shifts,
[00:23:53] markets tend to fragment in ways that we don't foresee and they end up being less competitive in
[00:23:58] SPEAKER_01: certain areas and people kind of settle into different areas. So, you know, on the model side,
[00:24:04] SPEAKER_01: so far, the way it looks like it's played out is it will be more like the cloud industry. Like it's
[00:24:10] SPEAKER_01: not going to be a winner take all. Certain technical advantages seem limited in time frame, right? Like
[00:24:17] SPEAKER_01: there's kind of, you know, always this kind of constantly frogging of the model industry. So I think
[00:24:22] SPEAKER_01: it will look like, you know, the cloud industry in the sense that there will be multiple players.
[00:24:27] SPEAKER_01: There will be profit pools for them. It's sort of like early days we were saying like,
[00:24:32] SPEAKER_01: is this going to be aircraft manufacturing or is it going to be airlines? Like those are the two
[00:24:36] SPEAKER_01: extremans of the spectrum. Aircraft manufacturing has high profit margins because there's really high
[00:24:43] SPEAKER_01: capital intensity and it's extremely hard technically. So that like would seem to mirror the model
[00:24:52] SPEAKER_01: industry airlines on the other hand, you know, are horribly competitive industries and, you know,
[00:24:57] SPEAKER_01: that they all go bankrupt in the fullness of time. So it seems like the model industry is going to be
[00:25:01] SPEAKER_01: like aircraft manufacturers or the cloud industry. Why did cloud play out the way it did? Like, is it
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_00: just size of market? Is that I think it's size? Yeah, I think it's that simple that if it's big enough,
[00:25:11] SPEAKER_00: you're just going to have multiple winners and not a one to take off. Yeah, it's size of market.
[00:25:15] SPEAKER_01: To me, it's all that that one is all size market. Like it's just so vast and cloud is such an
[00:25:21] SPEAKER_01: interesting market because the cloud, like if you could just independently own AWS, Microsoft,
[00:25:27] SPEAKER_01: Azure and GCP, like those would be some of the most valuable companies in the world. Like those
[00:25:31] SPEAKER_01: would be awesome businesses to own. On the other side of it, you know, one of my partners,
[00:25:37] SPEAKER_01: Alex Rampel has this has this has a statement that he likes to say, which is like the best
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_01: best business in the world don't have customers. They have hostages. That's not actually the case
[00:25:47] SPEAKER_01: in cloud. Like sure, there are some things like egress fees. Like the clouds are anti-competitive
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_01: with egress fees. Like they make it really hard to leave and get your data out and all that stuff.
[00:25:57] SPEAKER_01: But that's kind of minor. Like generally speaking, the customers in that market are well served.
[00:26:01] SPEAKER_01: Like they're happy. Like it's been positive some for them. You know, and at the same time,
[00:26:05] SPEAKER_01: the clouds are really good businesses. I think the same is likely to happen in the model space.
[00:26:10] SPEAKER_01: And so the market is going to be so big it will fragment in ways that we don't yet expect. And,
[00:26:17] SPEAKER_01: you know, even if you're in a number two in terms of absolute revenue size or, you know,
[00:26:22] SPEAKER_01: sort of market awareness, that's okay. What's not okay probably, I would think, is being in the number
[00:26:29] SPEAKER_01: two in something like the dominant consumer, you know, chat interface or something like that.
[00:26:36] SPEAKER_00: I want to talk about competition in our industry for investment opportunities in the market leaders
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_00: led by technical terminators or others. It's become in our collective careers. You've been in
[00:26:48] SPEAKER_00: this specific business much longer than me. But across your career, it's become way more institutionalized.
[00:26:53] SPEAKER_00: There's way more players. There's way more money. The people you're up against on a daily basis
[00:26:58] SPEAKER_00: are probably more talented sometimes by a lot. So you have to keep up with that. How does the competitive
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_00: describe the competitive dynamic when you are trying to make a big investment in a big exciting
[00:27:10] SPEAKER_00: company led by a consensus, amazing person in a big market? What does that feel like now? And I'm
[00:27:16] SPEAKER_00: also interested in how it's changed over time. Yeah. So, Mark and Ben have told the stories about
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_01: the origin of starting the firm and their experience with the venture capital product
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_01: and why they built the firm the way they did. And whenever they tell those stories, I'm like,
[00:27:32] SPEAKER_01: that's great. And man, wouldn't have been fun to compete in that time? That would have been awesome.
[00:27:38] SPEAKER_01: The market is definitely more competitive now. It's become a lot more institutionalized for good
[00:27:42] SPEAKER_01: reason though. Like the thing that I'm telling our team and I talk about with my partners now
[00:27:48] is we're a grown up industry now. Like this is no longer some little bespoke asset class.
[00:27:54] When I started my career, there were, you know, you and I were getting out of college. How many,
[00:28:00] there were probably one or two technology companies in the largest 10 market cap companies in the
[00:28:06] SPEAKER_01: world. Now it's eight of 10, eight of 10, and seven of the eight are West Coast technology venture
[00:28:12] SPEAKER_01: backed companies. Like I feel like that hasn't that realization hasn't really fully hit, you know,
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_01: the finance industry. You know, if you look at that, tech has kind of overtaken all of the market
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_01: cap creation and is driving driving, the mostly driving force of the stock market and the economy.
[00:28:28] SPEAKER_01: The private markets have become a real asset class. This is something I'm studying now because,
[00:28:34] SPEAKER_01: you know, the venture industry, you know, is sort of seen as like this small, non-scalable thing.
[00:28:40] Turns out there's five trillion of private market cap that is, you know, up 10X in the last 10
[00:28:47] SPEAKER_01: years. And it's honestly some of the best companies in the world. That market cap represents almost
[00:28:54] SPEAKER_01: a quarter of the entire S&P 500. It's more than half of the Mag 7. So I think that we now are in the
[00:29:03] SPEAKER_01: grown-up in the big leagues and we need to start acting like it. So we've adapted our firm a lot
[00:29:09] SPEAKER_01: to that realization. And oh, by the way, one other comment just on that industry, you know,
[00:29:15] SPEAKER_01: in how it's changed. We just did this analysis. If you look at our public universe, so where do we
[00:29:21] SPEAKER_01: spend most of our time? It's like software consumer and tech stuff. The public universe in those
[00:29:26] SPEAKER_01: sectors, there's less than five companies growing 30%. It's kind of staggering. Like that's a low
[00:29:34] SPEAKER_01: number. Our portfolio on average dollar weight is growing 112%. And some of these companies are big
[00:29:39] SPEAKER_01: enough to be, you know, the large companies. And, you know, if you look at the small cap universe
[00:29:44] SPEAKER_01: in the public markets, first of all, public markets have shrunk by half in the last 20 years. And if
[00:29:48] SPEAKER_01: you look at the, the sort of composition of small cap public companies, the quality I would argue
[00:29:56] SPEAKER_01: is so much lower than what is available in the private markets. So the industry is real. It shouldn't
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_01: be a surprise that the competition has intensified. I think about the competition, similar to how our
[00:30:07] SPEAKER_01: venture folks think about it, which is the market has sort of become a barbell. You know, and so
[00:30:15] SPEAKER_01: we're faced with the large multi-stage firms that have very strong venture practices on the
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_01: one hand. And those are the fiercest competitors for us. I respect my peers there. They're trying
[00:30:26] SPEAKER_01: to play the same game as us, which is when we have something special at the series A or the seed,
[00:30:33] SPEAKER_01: like we want to hold it really tightly. And they want to do the same thing. And sometimes they're
[00:30:37] SPEAKER_01: effective at it. Sometimes we're effective at it. But we have to kind of battle that out.
[00:30:43] On the other side is, you know, on the venture side, it's sort of bespoke kind of,
[00:30:50] SPEAKER_01: you know, in the retail analogy, there's like the super store, like the Walmart and, you know,
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_01: Amazon, which is sort of how we would get characterized. And then the other side is sort of like the
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_01: Gucci store, you know, or the Prada store, which is like deep specialization. So, you know,
[00:31:03] SPEAKER_01: Nat and Daniel would have been an example of the, you know, Elad, you know, as an example of that.
[00:31:09] SPEAKER_01: And then there's many others that do a really good job, you know, at what they do. So, you know,
[00:31:14] SPEAKER_01: have respect for a lot of the crossover folks, you know, who are in our world and have built
[00:31:18] SPEAKER_01: private businesses and have done a good job with it. So, what do you do to beat these people?
[00:31:23] SPEAKER_00: Like the actual extreme versions of the answer. Like the lengths that you're willing to go to to win.
[00:31:28] SPEAKER_00: I think you would love to have some story that's like sensational in the moment where we
[00:31:34] SPEAKER_01: did something crazy. The reality of the growth stage business is we win deals based on years of
[00:31:41] SPEAKER_01: relationship building. You know, we recently did a deal where the founder, we had sort of worked
[00:31:46] SPEAKER_01: the founder so hard that, you know, he called us and he was like, hey, I'm ready to do this. I'll just
[00:31:53] SPEAKER_01: talk to you. And I'm like, oh, wow. Okay, fruits of my labor. Like two years of this. This is good.
[00:31:58] SPEAKER_01: Then at that point, he's one of the best companies in the market. And the dynamic that we are faced with
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_01: is, okay, this is awesome. I got a clean look. I know for sure if he was going to market,
[00:32:12] SPEAKER_01: he would get a higher price than what he just told me. But can I bear the price? And so that's often
[00:32:18] SPEAKER_01: the exercise that we have to go through as growth investors is what do we know differently
[00:32:24] SPEAKER_01: about the product or the market or what are our expectations that will allow us to do it that
[00:32:30] maybe, you know, aren't as obvious. And so what are you doing in those two years that earned you
[00:32:34] SPEAKER_00: that right? Maybe that's what the extreme measures are. Helping them as if we were already investors
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_01: in their company. And so helping them with candidates, helping them customers spending quality time
[00:32:46] SPEAKER_01: and showing that we understand their business. Like, maybe often that's the biggest thing. Honestly,
[00:32:51] SPEAKER_01: the, for the companies where we're not existing investors, oddly enough, sometimes it's easier
[00:32:58] SPEAKER_01: because our platform is so strong, our brand is so strong. I'll give you another fun example,
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_01: which was, you know, Dylan at Figma when we first invested in Dylan at Figma. You know, I was
[00:33:09] SPEAKER_01: considering joining the firm from GA. This was 2018. You know, one of, I knew all the guys already
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_01: at the firm. And so I'm spending time with Peter Levine, who's one of our partners. And, you know,
[00:33:19] SPEAKER_01: I come in and I'm like, Peter, what's top of mind? You know, how are you thinking about the growth
[00:33:23] SPEAKER_01: business? What can I tell you? He was like, we need this tomorrow. We got invested in Figma.
[00:33:30] SPEAKER_01: Like, we need this tomorrow. Like, we, I don't know how we didn't, you know, we, we, we missed it. We,
[00:33:35] SPEAKER_01: you know, I was linked to it. Like, we just need a growth business and it was growth deal and we
[00:33:38] SPEAKER_01: should have done it. It's crazy. We did GitHub early. How did we not do this one? And he was just,
[00:33:43] SPEAKER_01: like, apoplectic, you know, like, I need this. And so that was very encouraging and exciting. So day
[00:33:49] SPEAKER_01: one, you know, I told you, I knew the six companies in the portfolio. I also knew like the five-ish
[00:33:54] SPEAKER_01: companies that are really loved outside the portfolio. You know, Roblox was one that I was close to.
[00:33:58] SPEAKER_01: Figma was another. And so from the moment I joined, we had done the full court press on Dylan. Like,
[00:34:03] SPEAKER_01: he came to our summit. You know, it was Mark and Ben Bearhugs. Like, he was really into crypto. We
[00:34:08] SPEAKER_01: Bearhugged him on the crypto side. Like, we did everything we could with him, helping him with a
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_01: board search. We placed a person in our network onto his board. Like, we were trying to do everything.
[00:34:18] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, trying to catalyze the deal and he was like, I'll let you know when, I'll let you know
[00:34:22] SPEAKER_01: when. So COVID strikes. And he calls us and he's like, now's the time. Like, oh my god. This was
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_01: in the moment of COVID where we all thought the world was going to end. You know, everything was
[00:34:31] SPEAKER_01: screwed. Stock market was way down. And I felt like, oh great. Good timing. So, you know, at least we
[00:34:37] SPEAKER_01: got the look. And so he, you know, he came and pitched. We had done all the work. And we're having
[00:34:42] the debate as a team, you know, it was taking this tradition. Me and my team were taking this
[00:34:47] SPEAKER_01: traditional growth lens, looking at it and we're like the market for designers is for designers.
[00:34:52] SPEAKER_01: Not that big. You know, it's like really small. And if you do the math of the market size of
[00:34:56] SPEAKER_01: designers and what they charge, you know, just I don't think that the price makes sense at
[00:35:01] SPEAKER_01: $2 billion. Like, this is just, it's too limiting. And our venture guys were losing their minds
[00:35:07] SPEAKER_01: in this discussion. They're like, you guys are totally missing the point. Like, the number,
[00:35:12] SPEAKER_01: the ratio of designers to engineers is basically double for the modern technology companies.
[00:35:21] SPEAKER_01: So that's a leading indicator. Everyone is going to, you know, that ratio is going to change.
[00:35:25] SPEAKER_01: There's going to be double the designers in the world. More importantly, the whole engineering
[00:35:28] SPEAKER_01: to design process is changing. And there's sort of a melding that's happening of front-end engineering
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_01: and design. And so thinking about this as the market for design is way too limiting. And so you're
[00:35:41] SPEAKER_01: just missing the point. We were debating it and, you know, it was like speaking past each other.
[00:35:45] SPEAKER_01: And finally, Ben called it off. He's like, okay, all right, like we're not going to solve this tonight.
[00:35:50] SPEAKER_01: You know, ultimately it was a call in the growth fund side. And I slept on it. And I woke up and
[00:35:56] SPEAKER_01: I was like, look, this is an exceptional business model. And we're kind of squinting to believe
[00:36:01] SPEAKER_01: enough on the market size. You know, great founder, great business model is the market good enough.
[00:36:07] SPEAKER_01: And I'm kind of happy to take that risk. The risk I don't want to take is quality of business,
[00:36:14] SPEAKER_01: quality of founder. But you really had to have a nuanced view of the market in order to get there.
[00:36:19] SPEAKER_01: As like with a traditional growth investing lens. And so fortunately, we got there. You know,
[00:36:23] SPEAKER_01: it worked out really well. I bring up that story one to say that's an example of something where you
[00:36:29] SPEAKER_01: kind of have to the price is the price and you kind of have to figure out if you can take it.
[00:36:33] SPEAKER_01: Like if you're willing for the very best of the best companies. But two, I think it speaks to
[00:36:38] the advantage that we have and what you need to be successful in growth investing. Like you need
[00:36:44] SPEAKER_01: those product and market insights or you're just going to live in a spreadsheet and die in a
[00:36:48] SPEAKER_01: spreadsheet. And so, you know, everything that we've done or I've done and our team has done
[00:36:55] SPEAKER_01: to design a process of tightly integrating with our early stage teams has been in the spirit of
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_01: optimizing insights around people, products and markets. And I think that's where you actually
[00:37:07] SPEAKER_01: get success. One thing that I'm trying to do more of because I'm just interested by it is the
[00:37:13] SPEAKER_00: to hear about like the minutia of your day and life. Like the in this incredibly competitive
[00:37:19] SPEAKER_00: environment, I've become interested in how some of the best investors literally just like run a
[00:37:24] SPEAKER_00: given day. And what that looks like for you. And I think you'd be surprised like how in the weeds
[00:37:31] SPEAKER_00: I'm interested in learning about. And so like air on the side of detail, like I'm just I'm just
[00:37:36] SPEAKER_00: curious what the actual life of your job feels and looks like. You know, Bob Swan, who is a long time
[00:37:44] SPEAKER_01: mentored and friend of mine and an operating partner at our firm gave me this really good advice
[00:37:50] SPEAKER_01: that he and John Donoho at the end of every year always went through an exercise where they
[00:37:56] SPEAKER_01: spent like two hours looking at their calendar from the year. And then they had an objective
[00:38:01] SPEAKER_01: of cutting 30% of stuff that was on their calendar. And that you know, there was a way for them to
[00:38:07] SPEAKER_01: make sure that they were giving responsibility down to the people on their teams, but also that
[00:38:11] SPEAKER_01: they would get leverage. So he's given me that and then he reminds me of it when he can tell him
[00:38:16] SPEAKER_01: too busy with things that I shouldn't be. And so I think I'm like not very good at this,
[00:38:21] SPEAKER_01: but I'll answer the question anyway. I try to make sure I'm spending adequate time meeting
[00:38:30] SPEAKER_01: companies. So right now our investment business looks something like two thirds relatively known
[00:38:38] SPEAKER_01: companies and one third like kind of newer stuff. But I want to make sure my time is spent pretty
[00:38:45] SPEAKER_01: differently than that. Like I want my time to be 20% on those known companies and spending time
[00:38:51] SPEAKER_01: with people like Ali and you know, the founders' band role like whatever it may be, flux safety.
[00:38:56] SPEAKER_01: But I want most of my time spent on the new stuff. Like I need to be learning about those new
[00:39:00] SPEAKER_01: markets. And so constantly meeting with AI founders, talking to smart AI employees and making sure
[00:39:05] SPEAKER_01: that I'm deep and conversational and have an understanding of those markets. So I spend a lot of my day
[00:39:10] SPEAKER_01: on that. I've started to kind of move away from like doing one-on-ones and I'm like, you know what?
[00:39:16] I don't need to schedule one-on-ones. I talk to my team all the time. I'll call them after hours.
[00:39:20] SPEAKER_01: I've started to very deliberately block off hours and days. So I block off two hours every Tuesday,
[00:39:28] SPEAKER_01: two hours every Thursday. And then I also put an hour and a half block twice a week in afternoons.
[00:39:36] And that often gets consumed with things that are pressing and you know, I need to make calls or
[00:39:40] SPEAKER_01: whatever it may be. But I find that I learn a lot and develop a lot of my own thinking just by
[00:39:47] SPEAKER_01: having think time. And I'm the kind of person that has 20 things open in the browser and I want to
[00:39:53] SPEAKER_01: read them all and then I don't get to them. So unless I block off a bunch of time, I actually just
[00:39:58] SPEAKER_01: don't find that I'm spending the time learning as much as I should. You know, that's, I'd say,
[00:40:04] trying to learn about company spending time with entrepreneurs, I want to be 80% of my time.
[00:40:11] SPEAKER_01: And then 20% is spending time with founders, you know, internal management,
[00:40:17] you know, time shift when we're fundraising. How many new companies do you think you meet a week?
[00:40:24] We as a growth fund probably meet 30 companies a week. Now not new, probably 30 companies a week.
[00:40:30] SPEAKER_01: I personally probably need 10 maybe. So how do you run those meetings? Like if I came into one of those 10,
[00:40:38] SPEAKER_00: what is the structure of the meeting? I keep the introduction super brief. I like to jump in and say,
[00:40:43] SPEAKER_01: hey, why don't you please spend, you know, five minutes explaining to me the strategy and your vision?
[00:40:50] SPEAKER_01: Because I've read your website. I know a little bit about the company. I've talked to some
[00:40:54] SPEAKER_01: customers maybe, but like I need to hear the like the what is the bigger. Like what do you want to tell?
[00:40:59] SPEAKER_01: You tell me. And then I just ask questions for 20 minutes. Okay. So what do you think about this?
[00:41:05] SPEAKER_01: What do you think about that? This may be a stupid question. But can you tell me about this? And I find
[00:41:09] SPEAKER_01: that to be a lot more effective. And you know, the ultimate compliment that we get from a founder is like,
[00:41:16] thanks, you've done your research or you know, hey, thanks for asking that question. That's pretty smart.
[00:41:22] SPEAKER_00: If you think about the reasons why you do this versus something else, what are the most important ones?
[00:41:26] SPEAKER_00: Like why why don't you why aren't you a founder? Why don't you work in some other industry? Why don't you
[00:41:32] SPEAKER_00: have your own firm? Like there's other things that you could do? What are the most important reasons why
[00:41:36] SPEAKER_00: this is the thing you do? So my wife would say that I have a low attention span. What she means by
[00:41:42] SPEAKER_01: that is I'm interested in a lot of different things. And this is a really cool way of getting to learn
[00:41:50] SPEAKER_01: about tons of new stuff. I suspect this is the same reason that you like to invest is how lucky
[00:41:56] SPEAKER_01: are we we get to sit and spend time with the entrepreneurs who are building the most interesting
[00:42:01] SPEAKER_01: companies in the world right now. We get to learn about the most cutting edge technology stuff that
[00:42:06] SPEAKER_01: if you were in the public markets or just in a job, you would never get a chance to learn about.
[00:42:11] SPEAKER_01: So I love to learn and I love to be around, you know, kind of great founders as they're exploring
[00:42:18] SPEAKER_01: really interesting things. So that that part of it is really, really attractive. There's another
[00:42:25] SPEAKER_01: part that plays to a totally different side of me, which is this business is a scoreboard business.
[00:42:32] And like I convey this to our team all the time. There's a scoreboard in this business.
[00:42:37] And our expectation is that we win. Now it's a very long dated scoreboard, you know, especially in
[00:42:42] SPEAKER_01: the venture side, but on the growth side, even it's a pretty long dated scoreboard. But at the
[00:42:46] SPEAKER_01: end of the day, like we have to put up returns. Like our customers are our founders and our LPs.
[00:42:52] SPEAKER_01: And on the founder side, we need to make sure we do a great job with them and they're sort of a
[00:42:56] SPEAKER_01: virtuous flywheel if we do. On the LPs side, like it's pretty simple. Like are we doing a good job
[00:43:02] SPEAKER_01: generating returns. So we, A16z, we're known as sort of running ourselves a little bit differently
[00:43:07] SPEAKER_01: as a firm. Mark and Ben really drive that. We do things like, you know, Ben runs every new employee
[00:43:14] SPEAKER_01: onboarding and he runs through our culture document. When you sign an offer letter at our firm,
[00:43:20] SPEAKER_01: you sign your offer letter, but you also have to sign our culture document, which lays out our
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_01: cultural principles. I also created a subset of principles that I wanted to convey for our growth
[00:43:30] SPEAKER_01: fund. The scoreboard, and we expect to win, is a very direct way of saying like we better be competitive.
[00:43:37] I have one that is we are the Yankees and we're going to act like it. And what I mean by that is not,
[00:43:45] SPEAKER_01: you know, we're going to be arrogant or, you know, we think we're the best team or something like that.
[00:43:51] SPEAKER_01: What I mean by that is we're lucky enough to be a part of a firm that has an incredible brand.
[00:43:57] And so we're going to run our team very, very high performance. Like if you're on the Yankees,
[00:44:02] SPEAKER_01: you better be performing. Like this is the big stage. And so our expectations for our team
[00:44:06] SPEAKER_01: were very collaborative. We care about winning as a team, but you better be good. Like you better
[00:44:11] SPEAKER_01: be doing your job really well. You better be working hard. This is one of the things that
[00:44:17] maybe is not as obvious to people. It wasn't as obvious to me actually until I joined the firm.
[00:44:23] It's so funny when I was considering it. My perception from the outside before I really started
[00:44:29] SPEAKER_01: the process was like Mark and Ben, I don't know, they're kind of like celebrities.
[00:44:34] SPEAKER_01: Simile celebrities, like do they really work hard? They get all these other interests. And I got in
[00:44:39] and man, it is a competitive place. Like we are very intensely competitive. We won win. And everybody
[00:44:45] SPEAKER_01: works really, really hard. Like no one is resting on their laurels. We're all constantly chatting,
[00:44:51] SPEAKER_01: nonstop. Like late at night, we're all working hard. We're kicking around ideas. And I love that.
[00:44:57] SPEAKER_01: I love the dynamic of partnership, but high expectations around performance. On the, you know,
[00:45:03] SPEAKER_01: why am I at A16z? Why don't I run my own firm? I always tell people kind of have a dream job.
[00:45:09] SPEAKER_01: This is awesome. I got to join a firm that was on the top of their game. They were on
[00:45:15] SPEAKER_01: their scent, but there was a real late and opportunity for us to build a franchise on the gross side.
[00:45:21] SPEAKER_01: And I came from a place with a really strong culture at GA, but I joined a place that is full of
[00:45:29] SPEAKER_01: optimism. And I think you need that in growth investing. Like that is the number one ingredient.
[00:45:34] SPEAKER_01: You've got to be optimistic. You've got to be able to see what can go right.
[00:45:37] SPEAKER_01: But I also got a chance to hire the team. I got to set the strategy, set the investment process,
[00:45:45] SPEAKER_01: take what I felt, you know, were some of the learnings that I had, which were great. And, you know,
[00:45:50] SPEAKER_01: bring those things with me and leave some things behind. And so, for example, one of the things
[00:45:54] SPEAKER_01: that we set up at the outset was a bit of a different investment decision-making process than
[00:46:01] SPEAKER_01: a traditional growth equity investment firm. Right? So most growth equity investment firms
[00:46:06] SPEAKER_01: have an investment committee. It's central. You go, you present, you kind of battle to get the votes,
[00:46:13] the disappear, and then the smoke comes out. And like here's the decision. Here's the decision.
[00:46:17] SPEAKER_01: What we decided to do at the firm in the growth fund was do it totally differently. So we were
[00:46:21] SPEAKER_01: going to actually make the decision process just like our venture process, which is single trigger
[00:46:26] SPEAKER_01: puller. The expectation I have set with our team and that Mark and Ben have sort of conveyed,
[00:46:32] SPEAKER_01: and I think we do a pretty good job of this. You got to be intellectually honest.
[00:46:37] You've got to be transparent. And we openly expect disagreement. But once you disagree,
[00:46:43] SPEAKER_01: you disagree, and then you commit. I think by doing it this way, you encourage people to fully
[00:46:49] SPEAKER_01: explore the risks of investing and fully explore the rewards. You're never in this temptation
[00:46:57] SPEAKER_01: to sell or to politic for a vote or try to influence someone's decision for the wrong reasons.
[00:47:04] SPEAKER_01: Like if you really like something and you really want to push, we don't have that dynamic. So I
[00:47:07] SPEAKER_01: think it allows us to more openly explore the merits of an investment. And I think it's been
[00:47:14] SPEAKER_01: you know a reasonably good process. And we're small. And so we, you know, we move very fast. We do
[00:47:18] SPEAKER_01: this, you know, very iteratively. It's not like we need to have a Monday investment committee
[00:47:23] SPEAKER_01: process. Like my first investment committee decision was, you know, before I even joined the firm.
[00:47:30] SPEAKER_01: And it was, you know, Mark Scott and I having breakfast and we were deciding on our investment
[00:47:34] SPEAKER_01: at breakfast. I like to keep it informal, but we want to make it rigorous at the same time.
[00:47:38] SPEAKER_01: The other thing I did that's a little bit different is when we hired the team, by the way,
[00:47:44] SPEAKER_01: I feel very lucky. It's one of the most special parts of how the job for me. It's about 10
[00:47:50] SPEAKER_01: investors. So it's pretty small. The reason we can be so small is because we have the early stage
[00:47:54] SPEAKER_01: teams, but you know, a cultural trade that I think we've done a pretty good job of building is
[00:47:59] SPEAKER_01: just collaboration and the willingness to roll up your sleeves and help people.
[00:48:03] SPEAKER_01: As part of the team's sort of promotion criteria, evaluation, et cetera, I put in their
[00:48:10] contribution to collective investment judgment, like entry level. Like from the start,
[00:48:14] SPEAKER_01: this is part of your job. You better be contributing to our collective investment judgment.
[00:48:19] SPEAKER_01: And it's something that we're going to evaluate you on from the start. And so it's a little bit
[00:48:23] SPEAKER_01: different, you know, for a junior person to be faced with that. A lot of times the junior folks
[00:48:27] SPEAKER_01: when they join, they have to find their footing and, you know, when do they chime in, when do they
[00:48:30] SPEAKER_01: not. But I think it's made us, you know, better as a team at making decisions.
[00:48:34] SPEAKER_01: If you think about the environments that are better or worse for growth investing of the type
[00:48:38] SPEAKER_00: that you do, what are those conditions? Like if you could cook up in the kitchen, like the perfect
[00:48:44] SPEAKER_00: environment for you to be deploying dollars, what are the features of it?
[00:48:48] Well, the optimal would be early product cycle, bad capital cycle. But those rarely happen in,
[00:48:56] SPEAKER_01: you know, coincide with one another. If I had to pick, I mean, it's all early product cycle.
[00:49:01] SPEAKER_01: For the style of growth investing that we do, what does that mean early product cycle?
[00:49:05] It means we're at the outset of a new technological change that is going to
[00:49:11] SPEAKER_00: propel a new market wave. And so maybe it's easiest to highlight in retrospect.
[00:49:18] It turns out that when you and I were starting our investing careers, like we started at a really
[00:49:23] SPEAKER_01: good time. Like you did. I was in public markets. Well, you were in public markets and so you had to
[00:49:27] SPEAKER_01: deal with GFC and stuff. Notwithstanding that, that's capital, it's capital cycle. That one.
[00:49:33] It turns out, and it's obvious in retrospect, it's really hard to feel at the moment.
[00:49:37] SPEAKER_01: Maybe less so because AI is so well covered. And the question is, are we at an AI bubble now or not?
[00:49:42] SPEAKER_01: Is there a good product cycle ahead of us? But it turns out that we had at the same time, we had the
[00:49:47] SPEAKER_01: mobile, we had cloud, SaaS, e-commerce, all the same time. And that was a great setup for us.
[00:49:55] If you look at all the mistakes that we've made as an industry 2021, it's very well covered.
[00:50:01] SPEAKER_01: I always tell people the biggest mistake from 2021 is that we were actually kind of late product
[00:50:05] SPEAKER_01: cycle. And we just didn't realize it at the time. There's a bit of a head fake with COVID.
[00:50:08] SPEAKER_01: We didn't realize we were late product cycle. And what that means in practice is the ideas are just
[00:50:14] SPEAKER_01: worse. The market opportunities are worse. It's just harder to go be successful. Right now,
[00:50:20] SPEAKER_01: when I talk to our investors, our LPs, they're all asking me, all of the questions are,
[00:50:26] SPEAKER_01: are we in a bubble? Is the market too hot? How are you dealing with valuations?
[00:50:30] SPEAKER_01: And I'm like, look, we're trying to be very balanced about this. At the same time, 10 years from now,
[00:50:35] SPEAKER_01: there's going to be a bunch of really, really great companies. And so we've got to be in the market
[00:50:40] SPEAKER_01: on the field. It turns out that the last two years coming out, 22 to early 25, I think we're
[00:50:49] SPEAKER_01: a really good period. I think this is going to be a great vintage of time to have been investing.
[00:50:53] SPEAKER_01: We also have been surprised at how long the companies have stayed private. They've stayed on the
[00:50:58] SPEAKER_01: Bingo card for us longer than we expected. And that's been great because we've converted those in
[00:51:02] SPEAKER_01: a really, I think in a really attractive way. If you look at the last year of our activity,
[00:51:09] our portfolio dollar weighted is growing 112% and we entered at 21 times revenue. And so I'll
[00:51:15] SPEAKER_01: have this debate. First of all, I recognize that revenue multiples are flawed and all that,
[00:51:20] SPEAKER_01: especially for traditional investors. If I could invest for the rest of my career in 112%
[00:51:26] SPEAKER_01: growing companies that are really, really great and good in markets at 21 times revenue,
[00:51:30] SPEAKER_01: I would do it in a heartbeat. I would do it in a heartbeat. I think that's way less risky than
[00:51:36] SPEAKER_01: something where you're buying 12% grower and PE for 15 times EBITDA because growth just takes
[00:51:44] SPEAKER_01: care of so much for you. I think above 30% growth, the market still doesn't fully value the growth rate.
[00:51:50] SPEAKER_01: Why is that the case? I think it's just hard to model. My conclusion, I've studied all these
[00:51:57] SPEAKER_01: companies that are, I call them the model busters, but I've studied all these companies. It is
[00:52:02] SPEAKER_01: just so hard for any investor to build a five or 10-year model where high growth persists.
[00:52:10] SPEAKER_01: It's just not natural. The natural inclination, no one built a financial model for Google or Visa
[00:52:18] SPEAKER_01: that had them growing 20 years into existence at 15 or 20%. It would just be totally unnatural to do so.
[00:52:26] If you look at the moment of the iPhone, and this goes back to the point about product cycles and
[00:52:30] SPEAKER_01: how much you can get surprised, in 2009, if you looked at consensus estimates for Apple,
[00:52:37] and then compared for 2013. 2009, consensus estimate for the year 2013,
[00:52:45] and compared it to actual performance in 2013, consensus estimates were off by 3x.
[00:52:51] SPEAKER_01: That's a massive number, and that's the most covered company in the world.
[00:52:59] I think you can be surprised on growth on these things. I get a big kick out of that. I try to
[00:53:04] SPEAKER_01: learn a lot about it, but I think it's not natural to model anything that way. It's so natural to
[00:53:10] SPEAKER_01: just say, hey, this company's growing 80%, then they're going to grow 65, then 50, then 40, then 30,
[00:53:16] SPEAKER_01: then a terminal growth rate, and it's very different than a company if it grows 80, and then the
[00:53:21] growth rate persists 75, 65. It's like a 3x difference in your evaluation, and so you can just
[00:53:27] SPEAKER_01: get it massively different. That's why I love high growth. It's obvious. That's the math behind
[00:53:30] SPEAKER_01: why I love it. Again, it's actually just hard to appreciate because it's not natural to build a
[00:53:36] SPEAKER_01: model that way. You and I have talked before about this idea of push versus pull companies. Can you
[00:53:40] SPEAKER_00: describe that difference and how that's an idea that you care about when evaluating them?
[00:53:44] SPEAKER_00: It's magic when you find a pull business. I have a post-it note on my computer in the office
[00:53:53] SPEAKER_01: that says, is the market demanding more of your product? It's the most special thing when it happens.
[00:54:00] SPEAKER_01: And by the way, a lot of these AI companies, like what's so magical about the way
[00:54:06] Chatsch-y-P-T has grown? It's a billion users. It's organic. It's all brand. And the shocking
[00:54:11] SPEAKER_01: thing about that one, by the way, is it doesn't have a network effect. That was one of the more
[00:54:16] SPEAKER_01: surprising things for us. Is the market demanding more of your product? It's probably the most important
[00:54:22] SPEAKER_01: question that we can answer because when it happens, especially in consumer, it tends to create
[00:54:28] SPEAKER_01: the most special companies in the world. We've seen it in companies like Roblox when it really
[00:54:34] SPEAKER_01: works, and that one has two network effects. So it's super special. We also see it in companies
[00:54:40] SPEAKER_01: that aren't network effect or consumer. In the case of Andral, it turns out the market really,
[00:54:45] really is demanding more of their product. And there's many reasons for that. We've reached
[00:54:50] SPEAKER_01: all at the same time this confluence of AI capabilities, autonomy, know how and how to
[00:54:56] SPEAKER_01: navigate governments, mostly from alums of companies like Palantir in SpaceX. At the same time
[00:55:04] that we have a desperate geopolitical need. And so the market is demanding more of their product,
[00:55:09] SPEAKER_01: and that's really special. One of the things that I say about push businesses,
[00:55:14] which is you got to go sell it, sometimes those are really successful. And there's industries
[00:55:18] SPEAKER_01: where this is a case like cyber security and things like that. They don't tend to get easier
[00:55:22] SPEAKER_01: over time. They tend to get harder. If you have to go sell or market your product,
[00:55:27] SPEAKER_01: the bigger you get, often it gets harder. And so that's not always the case. Sometimes you get
[00:55:32] SPEAKER_01: increasing returns to scale from brand and things like that. But especially on the consumer side,
[00:55:37] SPEAKER_01: it almost always gets harder if you're a push business. TikTok maybe is the exception of the
[00:55:41] SPEAKER_01: rule. Where's their push that early? They pushed it early and so aggressively. And obviously,
[00:55:47] SPEAKER_01: if you're Facebook, you probably sit around and think about that decision forever. Maybe it's not
[00:55:52] SPEAKER_01: even a decision I wasn't on the inside, obviously. But obviously the growth of TikTok was fueled
[00:55:58] SPEAKER_01: by advertising on Facebook in large part, which is kind of crazy to think about. But especially
[00:56:04] SPEAKER_01: if you're a sort of Google or Facebook driven ad business, it almost never gets easier.
[00:56:10] SPEAKER_01: It always gets harder in Google and Facebook. The ones who accumulate better economics over time,
[00:56:15] SPEAKER_01: at the expense of the people who advertise on them. So the push versus pull thing, especially,
[00:56:20] SPEAKER_01: like so right now we talk about this in the age of AI. I think they're sort of like, how do we
[00:56:25] SPEAKER_01: assess AI businesses right now? It's an interesting thing. One is ease of customer acquisition.
[00:56:29] SPEAKER_01: And we see this with like the really, really special ones, like cursor, which is sort of been
[00:56:35] SPEAKER_01: largely viral growth. It happens even with things that need to be sold like a bridge. Like, you've
[00:56:40] SPEAKER_01: got to go sell to hospital systems. It turns out like hospital systems are dying for this because
[00:56:45] SPEAKER_01: the doctors love it. It's really good. It saves them a lot of time and it's really valuable. So ease
[00:56:49] SPEAKER_01: of customer acquisition is something that is sort of a must for us in this AI wave. The second is
[00:56:56] SPEAKER_01: customer behavior, customer retention, customer engagement. There are some headfakes that we've
[00:57:00] SPEAKER_01: seen of things that grow really fast and then they kind of fall off in their experimental. So,
[00:57:05] SPEAKER_01: you know, the things that have sort of durable behavior, things like cursor, you know,
[00:57:08] SPEAKER_01: where the users really, really use it. Ideally, you're increasingly used over time. Harvey is an
[00:57:13] SPEAKER_01: example of a company where as the models have gotten better, customer engagement and usage is
[00:57:18] SPEAKER_01: actually really grown. It actually took kind of a step change, which we've seen, which is interesting
[00:57:25] SPEAKER_01: to see because it kind of happened at the same time as reasoning. The reasoning breakthroughs,
[00:57:30] SPEAKER_01: we're like, oh, that makes sense actually. Like lawyers need to reason and turns out like,
[00:57:34] SPEAKER_01: the models got really good at reasoning and people use the products a lot more. And then there's
[00:57:37] SPEAKER_01: gross margins. And we kind of give a little bit of a pass on gross margins right now. We're in this
[00:57:42] SPEAKER_01: funny environment where, you know, late stage SaaS cloud, we would look at a company and it's like,
[00:57:47] SPEAKER_01: oh, man, if you're not 70% plus gross margin, you're not really a SaaS business cloud business
[00:57:52] SPEAKER_01: or whatever. That's going to be a knock and people will trade you differently. And that's when
[00:57:56] SPEAKER_01: you get value, just revenue versus gross profit or whatever. Now it's like a badge of honor to have
[00:58:01] SPEAKER_01: low gross margins. It's where like, oh, at least people are using your AI products. You know, if we
[00:58:06] SPEAKER_01: see, like we get these pitches and they're like, I have an AI thing, and I got 75% gross margins.
[00:58:10] SPEAKER_01: I'm like, well, no one's using the AI stuff then. That doesn't really seem like an AI product to me.
[00:58:14] SPEAKER_01: You know, we give a little bit of a pass on that. The expectation is the cost, you know,
[00:58:19] SPEAKER_01: is going to continue to go down. Just inference costs. Inference costs is going to go down
[00:58:22] SPEAKER_01: at a time. I mean, there's so many existential questions about market structure, you know, that
[00:58:27] SPEAKER_01: will predict inference costs, but you know, the history of technology would suggest that it's
[00:58:32] SPEAKER_01: going to go down at a time. You know, it's been the cost of, you know, inference has gone down
[00:58:38] SPEAKER_01: at the same time that reasoning happened. And so token usage has gone way up. So, you know,
[00:58:45] SPEAKER_01: you haven't yet seen any improvement in gross margins. But I think, you know, over time,
[00:58:50] SPEAKER_01: that's likely to happen. Do you basically just not care? Like, if a company has 0%
[00:58:54] SPEAKER_00: gross margin, for example, but the revenue growth and the customer love and all this kind of stuff,
[00:58:58] SPEAKER_00: the poll is all there. Does it round to, we don't care. So there's a big difference between
[00:59:04] SPEAKER_01: having 30% gross margins and 70% gross margins. So we do care. Our expectation is,
[00:59:11] if you're producing a lot of customer value, and if the models get a lot better over time,
[00:59:14] SPEAKER_01: you're going to increasingly produce customer value, that the cost is going to go down. There's
[00:59:20] SPEAKER_01: not going to be so much market power, the model providers, that it's going to settle out where
[00:59:25] SPEAKER_01: these businesses are probably higher margin businesses. I think they'll be lower margin
[00:59:28] SPEAKER_01: businesses than SaaS businesses. You know, maybe they end up as 50% margin companies is supposed to
[00:59:32] SPEAKER_01: 80. But the size of the impact and the usage and the amount that they'll be able to capture to
[00:59:39] SPEAKER_01: our point on business model earlier is probably so high that it's fine. How much do you care that
[00:59:44] SPEAKER_00: the way the product behaves and the way it's distributed is like truly singular and different
[00:59:50] SPEAKER_00: than competitors versus just like the best of a class of company? There's sort of a foundational
[00:59:56] SPEAKER_01: point, which is every great company either has unique product or unique distribution.
[01:00:04] SPEAKER_01: The best companies in the world have both. The best companies in the world have such unique
[01:00:10] SPEAKER_01: product that it leads to unique distribution. But if you don't have either of those, what's your
[01:00:15] SPEAKER_01: favorite example of that? I'll use a recent one that the product is so good that people just
[01:00:24] SPEAKER_01: naturally gravitate to it as cursor. And again, maybe in the fullness of time, that'll get harder.
[01:00:30] SPEAKER_01: But GitHub is a great example of this. I'll tell a funny story about GitHub too.
[01:00:36] SPEAKER_01: So GitHub was so special of a company that for a long period of time, they never actually
[01:00:43] SPEAKER_01: talked to customers. So the first time I ever met GitHub, we got to tell you this, this is so
[01:00:50] SPEAKER_01: awesome. We sold to Walmart and they're paying us $400,000 and no one ever talked to them on the phone.
[01:00:58] We were like, wow, this is an incredibly magical product and an incredibly magical market.
[01:01:04] Just imagine if you had talked to them on the phone, like what would they have paid you if you
[01:01:06] SPEAKER_01: just called them on the phone? They'd probably paid you $4 million. You know, unique product that
[01:01:11] SPEAKER_01: leads to unique distribution with a founder that wants to optimize the situation. So the AI founders,
[01:01:22] SPEAKER_01: I'm not the one involved with cursor, but Michael is a very special founder and his team.
[01:01:28] SPEAKER_01: They recognize what they have and then they are aggressively pursuing the enterprise at the same time.
[01:01:32] SPEAKER_01: And so that's a really good combination where you have unique product, you have great product
[01:01:36] SPEAKER_01: people love. That leads to some uniqueness of distribution and then you can build on that
[01:01:40] SPEAKER_01: advantage by saying, hey, we have all this bottoms up, you're like, we're going to go sell our
[01:01:44] SPEAKER_01: prizes. And so, big part of what we do is affirm is we help to facilitate customer
[01:01:51] SPEAKER_01: introductions, customer new business. We call it our go-to-market function. They're referred to as
[01:01:55] SPEAKER_01: EBCs sometimes. And we get notes after everyone. And this is the most fun thing in the world of AI
[01:02:02] SPEAKER_01: because we get these notes in like in the case of cursor every single time. It's like immediately
[01:02:09] SPEAKER_01: to pop. Immediately to pop, proof concept, whatever. Immediately to pop. And like, oh,
[01:02:14] SPEAKER_01: immediately to full sale deal. And like the customer, you can see that. That's actually incremental
[01:02:19] SPEAKER_01: data for us and making decisions. But you can see it like it is magic when it happens. And so
[01:02:28] SPEAKER_01: Martin led the A of cursor, one of my partners who leads our infrastructure fund. And after one of
[01:02:34] SPEAKER_01: these emails, he chimed in. And it's a big list. It's like 100 people on the list or something.
[01:02:41] He wrote product fucking market fit. And so now we're like, oh, PMF is now PFMF.
[01:02:49] SPEAKER_01: And so when you see that, that's unique product. That's unique distribution. And like you have
[01:02:55] SPEAKER_01: a founder, founding team, full seven employees who really want to optimize it. What are the trade-offs
[01:03:01] SPEAKER_00: of the way that Andreson is structured? Like no firm is perfect. Like there's choices for how you
[01:03:07] SPEAKER_00: have structured and nested the team. Lots of different groups leaders of groups like you.
[01:03:12] What are the negative parts or the negative parts of the trade-offs for how Andreson is structured
[01:03:18] SPEAKER_00: versus like a more monolithic structure or something that was just different? Our strategy for
[01:03:23] SPEAKER_00: scaling is pretty well covered. But effectively, we think scale allows us to bring more power to
[01:03:32] SPEAKER_01: the entrepreneurs and give them a greater chance to be successful in the market. That's the fundamental.
[01:03:38] That's the fundamental thesis behind the scaling for us. And with more resources, you can bring
[01:03:44] SPEAKER_01: you know, more resources to bear for the entrepreneur. So for us, when I joined,
[01:03:50] SPEAKER_01: every single Monday and every single Friday, we used to sit in the room together, all of us.
[01:03:56] And we'd hear all the pitches and then we'd have long meetings to talk about each of them,
[01:04:00] SPEAKER_01: all as a group. And so, you know, Dixon was leading our crypto fund and you know, we'd have
[01:04:06] SPEAKER_01: bio fund pitches and we'd all listen to all them and then we'd all debate. And then we realized
[01:04:11] SPEAKER_01: at a point like that was not the optimal use of time, you know, like Dixon weighing in on a,
[01:04:16] SPEAKER_01: you know, bio investment and vice versa, like probably doesn't make sense. And you could
[01:04:20] SPEAKER_01: extrapolate that out to a bunch of our, you know, a bunch of our investment processes. So we decided
[01:04:25] SPEAKER_01: to decentralize, Benemart said to decentralize the firm, sort of put, you know, more power down into
[01:04:31] SPEAKER_01: the investing teams that ran each investment fund. And the reasoning behind that is two fold.
[01:04:38] SPEAKER_01: One, we thought it would allow us to have better expertise around the table. Like if you're only
[01:04:44] SPEAKER_01: just fully deep in infrastructure or applications or American dynamism or crypto or bio, that's an
[01:04:51] SPEAKER_01: advantage. It's both an advantage in making decisions, but also an advantage in go-to-market with
[01:04:55] SPEAKER_01: the entrepreneurs. And then secondly, if we are going to scale, you can't scale an organization with
[01:05:01] SPEAKER_01: like 25 or 30 decision makers around a table. It's too hard. Like you can't make a trade-off between,
[01:05:07] SPEAKER_01: should we put an incremental dollar into a bio fund investment or a crypto investment or how should
[01:05:12] SPEAKER_01: we think about reserving this first that? It's too hard. And so we shrank the size of decision
[01:05:17] SPEAKER_01: makers by doing this to a smaller group who's in charge of their own funds. And so far, that's
[01:05:22] SPEAKER_01: working really well. And I think that's mostly a function of the fact that our early stage folks,
[01:05:27] SPEAKER_01: they're really good. And we're all really collaborative. The only trade-off that we have at the
[01:05:32] SPEAKER_01: growth fund is selfishly that process that I described where we all sit around the table.
[01:05:36] SPEAKER_01: It's kind of valuable for me. Like, you know, it's good for us to have access to all information
[01:05:41] SPEAKER_01: at all times because we sit across all of our early stage funds. The way we operate is we invest
[01:05:46] SPEAKER_01: across all of our sector. What percent of the investments you make did the firm have a prior
[01:05:51] SPEAKER_00: investment? A little over half. And then if you take the number of investments, so if you just do it
[01:05:59] SPEAKER_01: by dollars, it's a little over half that are pre-existing venture investments. And then if you add
[01:06:05] SPEAKER_01: the dollars that we're investing in pre-existing investments that were pre-existing growth fund
[01:06:10] SPEAKER_01: originated investments, it's something like follow-ons. It's something like 70%. So like 70% of the
[01:06:15] SPEAKER_01: dollars that we're investing, we get deep knowledge on the companies. I call it GameFilm.
[01:06:22] SPEAKER_01: Like, we just get, like, I talk about GameFilm all the time. You know, it's so important when
[01:06:27] SPEAKER_01: assessing an investment, when assessing a founder, you know, GameFilm was not just numbers. Like,
[01:06:31] SPEAKER_01: it's... How do you do reserving in the growth fund? Does it?
[01:06:34] SPEAKER_01: Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:06:35] SPEAKER_01: When we first started the growth fund, I was like, Scott, zero reserves. Let's do it. Every single dollar
[01:06:41] SPEAKER_01: is going to have to be, you know, scrutinized to it for literally every dollar. It turns out that's
[01:06:45] SPEAKER_01: not really practical. Like, you need to reserve a little bit. So we reserve a tiny amount. And this
[01:06:50] SPEAKER_01: is for small follow-ons where, you know, our participation is important, but we're not a lead.
[01:06:55] SPEAKER_01: We do zero reserving for large investment amounts that we think we're going to make in a company.
[01:07:01] SPEAKER_01: Because I think that would lead to lazy decision making. You know, we'd say, oh, well, we're reserved
[01:07:05] SPEAKER_01: for it. Let's do it. So you just treated as a new investment. Every single thing is a new investment.
[01:07:09] SPEAKER_01: So if you look at our largest investments in the growth fund and just run down the list, you know,
[01:07:15] SPEAKER_01: Databricks, SpaceX, Android, OpenAI, XAI, Flock Safety, Figma, Stripe, Coinbase. Look,
[01:07:24] SPEAKER_01: they're across all of... Most of them are across multiple funds. That's kind of by design. Like,
[01:07:29] SPEAKER_01: we want it... We want to be flexible and say, hey, if we're super excited about a new investment,
[01:07:34] SPEAKER_01: keep going. Just keep going. We have no target metrics for inside the fund, first outside the fund.
[01:07:42] SPEAKER_01: We have no target metrics for industry, like, you know, infrastructure versus American dynamism,
[01:07:48] SPEAKER_01: versus crypto or whatever. It should always be best idea as when. But I, you know, managed the fund.
[01:07:53] SPEAKER_01: And so I closely track like how are we doing on those metrics? And generally speaking, like,
[01:07:59] SPEAKER_01: thematically, do we feel like the fund is a good reflection of what we see as the opportunity set
[01:08:03] SPEAKER_01: for the next 10 years? Can we talk about selling? This is such an interesting topic to me because
[01:08:07] SPEAKER_00: you can ask lots of investors that invest in private markets, like when and how they sell.
[01:08:12] SPEAKER_00: And most of the answers you hear are really simple heuristics. Like, when you hear a lot is,
[01:08:17] SPEAKER_00: you know, when there's a crystallization, you sell a third, hold a third, hold a third forever.
[01:08:22] SPEAKER_00: It is like a thread wasn't... Yeah, like now, later or never. Yeah. That'd be one example. There's
[01:08:26] SPEAKER_00: lots of, you know, similar heuristics. How do you think about, especially because you're investing
[01:08:31] SPEAKER_00: at the growth stage, probably closer to the opportunity to sell to another investor or the thing going
[01:08:36] SPEAKER_00: public, talk about what you've learned about selling and just how you've done it so far.
[01:08:42] Selling is... It's so hard to do this job. We've tried a number of different variations. So I think
[01:08:48] SPEAKER_01: it's different at the venture stage. So like your Fred Wilson model, like the third to third,
[01:08:53] SPEAKER_01: I think it's totally sensible. You know, because he's coming in extremely early. And so, you know,
[01:08:58] SPEAKER_01: for him, that's relatively simple. You know, we have our own version of, it's not algorithmic,
[01:09:03] SPEAKER_01: but semi algorithmic decision making for the early stage. And, you know, we take some very simple
[01:09:10] SPEAKER_01: qualitative things like is the founder still running the company, which we value a lot, value a lot.
[01:09:16] SPEAKER_01: And then a sort of qualitative, are they the market leader that we feel great about? And if so,
[01:09:21] SPEAKER_01: we would buy us to hold longer. And if not, we would buy us to, you know, exit sooner. We also try
[01:09:26] SPEAKER_01: to overlay an assessment of how it's valued versus performance, which is really, really hard.
[01:09:32] And so, I would say we've been fortunate in that generally we've gotten it pretty right.
[01:09:39] SPEAKER_01: Why don't you buy whole companies? One of our folks in IRS me yesterday, like, why have we done
[01:09:44] SPEAKER_01: it by out fund? I think culturally, it's totally different than what we do. Like, all that we want
[01:09:53] SPEAKER_01: to do and all that we stand for is helping the next generation of companies go beat the incumbents.
[01:09:59] And so, culturally, buying the incumbent and trying to make them last as long as possible and
[01:10:05] SPEAKER_01: squeeze as much as they can out of their customers or whatever it may be, it's just culturally
[01:10:12] SPEAKER_00: antithetical to what we do. What are the most interesting strategies or things that
[01:10:17] SPEAKER_00: upstarts due to beat incumbents? Like, what are your favorite ways that company's beat incumbent?
[01:10:23] SPEAKER_00: Business model shift is a super powerful thing that's very hard for incumbents to react to.
[01:10:28] That's part of what is so exciting about the customer support industry in Decagon.
[01:10:32] SPEAKER_01: It's like the odds are so stacked in their favor because the business models can be very hard
[01:10:37] SPEAKER_01: for incumbents to react to. And it's on the customer side, better, faster, cheaper
[01:10:41] SPEAKER_01: by an order of magnitude in each case. So, business model shift is one. The two simple components
[01:10:48] SPEAKER_01: that I'm looking for, which generally we're not really seeing yet, is completely re-imagined UI
[01:10:54] SPEAKER_01: and then completely new sources of data. So, we're large investors in Databricks. We're very
[01:11:00] SPEAKER_01: optimistic about the data layer. I think they'll have some success and enabling applications built
[01:11:06] SPEAKER_01: on top. But the UI UX thing and the data thing, I think are what paired with a business model shift.
[01:11:11] SPEAKER_01: I think are what are going to give the startups the best chance against the incumbents.
[01:11:16] SPEAKER_01: The more dramatic the shift in those, the harder it's going to be for the incumbents. So,
[01:11:20] SPEAKER_01: take Salesforce.com. Like, I use this as an example. It's a good company. I never
[01:11:24] SPEAKER_01: thought it would be as big as it is. It's a good company. So, maybe they'll be one of the incumbents
[01:11:28] SPEAKER_01: that survives and reacts. What do people do in Salesforce.com? It's basically like
[01:11:35] SPEAKER_01: a sophisticated forum checker with some analysis. It's brutal. It's painful to use.
[01:11:43] The future with AI is not going to be anything like that. It's just going to be to my point
[01:11:48] SPEAKER_01: earlier about pro-active versus reactive. It's going to be a proactive thing. You a salesperson,
[01:11:53] you're going to log in your Salesforce and it's going to be like, hey, these are the five
[01:11:58] SPEAKER_01: customers that you have business that you should be doing. By the way, I've been monitoring
[01:12:02] SPEAKER_01: what they've been doing online. There's a shift in this group. You got to be aware of it. I've
[01:12:06] SPEAKER_01: drafted a call script. This person actually likes to be talked to on the phone. This person
[01:12:11] SPEAKER_01: wants just to engage via your AI email. I've drafted one for you. I've already taken a bunch of
[01:12:16] SPEAKER_01: action on your behalf. Here's what you need to do. That's going to be the future, I think.
[01:12:20] SPEAKER_01: The data that goes into informing that is no longer the database that makes Salesforce so powerful.
[01:12:26] SPEAKER_01: It's all the unstructured data that's getting pulled from every interaction that everyone has everywhere.
[01:12:31] SPEAKER_01: My hope is that the fullness of the new product has that entirely reimagined UI UX. The fact that it's
[01:12:40] SPEAKER_01: pulling all this new data from different places is an advantage to incumbent because Salesforce is
[01:12:46] SPEAKER_01: so sticky because of the column or database that they have. Then if you on top of it have a new
[01:12:51] SPEAKER_01: business model that's attached to it, I think that's a really good shot for a startup to be able to
[01:12:55] SPEAKER_01: finally go rip Salesforce out. If you look at the SaaS and Cloud Wave, basically the whole story
[01:13:01] SPEAKER_01: was a 7Xing in the amount of revenue in the market. There's this question of who wins the
[01:13:07] SPEAKER_01: incumbents versus startups. It basically split like 50-50. 7X, more revenue, incumbents grew a bunch.
[01:13:14] SPEAKER_01: They took half of the new share, startups took half the new share. I think the more dramatic the
[01:13:20] SPEAKER_01: shift, especially with the more dramatic the shift in the potential business model, the more likely
[01:13:25] SPEAKER_01: of favors the startups. That's the bets we make. My hope is that's what happens, but we'll see.
[01:13:31] SPEAKER_00: It's incredibly fun to explore all this with you in a formal way, having done it so in
[01:13:36] SPEAKER_00: formal way for 20 years or whatever it is. I think you might know my traditional closing question.
[01:13:40] SPEAKER_00: What is the kindest thing that anyone has ever done for you?
[01:13:43] SPEAKER_00: I do know that question. I've thought a lot about it because there's a lot of things that I consider
[01:13:49] SPEAKER_01: in my life that have broken my way. I grew up in Kentucky far away from this world.
[01:13:56] SPEAKER_01: A lot of lucky breaks kind of went my way. The thing that I reflect on the most is
[01:14:02] SPEAKER_01: we spent the whole time talking about work. The other thing that I do in my life is my kids.
[01:14:10] And something has become really clear to me with my kids' age that they are now, which is
[01:14:15] SPEAKER_01: the sacrifices my parents made for me are extraordinary. They're incredible.
[01:14:20] SPEAKER_01: My dad always brings up like, oh, I was on the sidelines in the rain watching you.
[01:14:25] SPEAKER_01: Driving you from soccer to baseball to basketball, sports and all the activities that I was able to
[01:14:31] SPEAKER_01: participate in as a kid, I think made me into the person I am in a lot of ways.
[01:14:35] SPEAKER_01: And now I see it with my kids because I have to do that work and I have such a greater appreciation
[01:14:40] SPEAKER_01: for what my parents gave to me and the sacrifices they made.
[01:14:42] SPEAKER_01: Amazing simple thought. Thanks for your time.
[01:14:44] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, great to be with you.
