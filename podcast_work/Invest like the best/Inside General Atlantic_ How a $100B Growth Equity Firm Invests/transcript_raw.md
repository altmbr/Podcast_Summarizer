[00:00:00] And I said, Dennis, it's a bubble.
[00:00:03] SPEAKER_01: How does it feel to be in a bubble?
[00:00:05] SPEAKER_01: Grab my hand and said, Martin, it feels better
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_01: than being outside the bubble.
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_01: And I was like, he's absolutely right.
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_01: I have to go into this bubble.
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_01: I'm in the wrong side of the table.
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_00: So I met Martin through Alex Bering at 3G.
[00:00:20] SPEAKER_00: I tried to ask everybody that I interview,
[00:00:22] SPEAKER_00: who should I do next?
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_00: Alex said, Martin, I asked why.
[00:00:25] SPEAKER_00: He said he's just the most lovable investor
[00:00:29] SPEAKER_00: that he's come across.
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_00: Something's where it cues to be in dolphins
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_01: in a sea of sharks.
[00:00:33] SPEAKER_00: I'd love to be a dolphin.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_01: Who wants to be a shark?
[00:00:35] SPEAKER_00: Dolphins have much better life.
[00:00:37] SPEAKER_00: I think in this conversation, you'll see that Alex is right.
[00:00:40] Martin has a refreshingly light, funny attitude
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_00: and way about him.
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_00: He clearly does not take himself or almost anything
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_00: too seriously.
[00:00:49] SPEAKER_00: And yet, has become one of the most successful private markets
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_00: investors now helping run General Atlantic, one of the story,
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_00: private equity and growth equity franchises in the world.
[00:01:00] SPEAKER_00: Drop down with no equipment other than the spear.
[00:01:03] SPEAKER_01: You let little fish go by because you're not there
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_01: to come little fish.
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_01: You're waiting for the big fish.
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_00: I think his life is an adventure where you can feel him,
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_00: not only getting better, but at every single moment,
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_00: making fun of it and laughing.
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_00: You'll hear him and me laugh a lot in this episode.
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_00: I wish there was way more of that in the investing field.
[00:01:25] SPEAKER_00: We're so often, it's so serious and so intense.
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_00: You can have excellence and laughter at the same time.
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_00: And I think Martin in this conversation
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_00: is a testament to that truth.
[00:01:40] Alex introduced us from 3G.
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_00: He told me this incredible story about you getting a job
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_00: after him telling you know and what you did to get it.
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_00: Can you tell that?
[00:01:49] SPEAKER_00: Can you tell him?
[00:01:49] SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry.
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_00: I'm also getting excited.
[00:01:51] SPEAKER_00: I tried to know the race, the one of the good stars.
[00:01:55] Coming out of business school, I need to say I worked at live.
[00:01:59] SPEAKER_01: Some from Bolivia, Bolivia is too small.
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_01: I was finishing eight years in the US,
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_01: US felt too competitive.
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_01: So I had to think somewhere else that had to be big,
[00:02:10] SPEAKER_01: not too competitive and have beautiful people.
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_01: I was single.
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_01: So that was the criteria.
[00:02:17] SPEAKER_01: So Brazil.
[00:02:17] SPEAKER_01: Brazil.
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_01: And of one, Brazil.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_01: So I look at the most exciting jobs in Brazil.
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_01: And at the time, the 3G founders had a private equity shop,
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_01: which at the time was the largest private equity shop
[00:02:31] in the emerging markets.
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_01: This is 1997.
[00:02:35] And one of the partners has recently graduated
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_01: from the same school, was coming to town
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_01: to interview Brazilians to hire one person.
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_01: So I was like, this is destiny.
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_01: This is for me.
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_01: So I reached out to Alex Bering, who is now running 3G.
[00:02:52] SPEAKER_01: And he's become a great friend.
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_01: And I introduce myself.
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_01: This is Bolivia and Supersmart.
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_01: I really want to make it in Brazil.
[00:03:00] SPEAKER_01: I hear you're doing a dinner.
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_01: I'd love to come by if you'll have me.
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_01: And Alex was super smart and tough.
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_01: He's like, Martin, we're only hiring one person.
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_01: And it's not going to be a guy from Bolivia.
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't speak Portuguese.
[00:03:13] SPEAKER_01: So no, you can't come to my dinner.
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_01: I was like, bummer.
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_01: So that night, I show up to the dinner,
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_01: introduced myself as Martin.
[00:03:22] SPEAKER_01: And I say, don't worry.
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_01: I'm not even going to eat.
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_01: I just want to listen to you.
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_01: Biggest time.
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_01: I'm just interesting.
[00:03:27] SPEAKER_01: And I think he was taken back by my boldness
[00:03:30] SPEAKER_01: that he did.
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_01: They did interview me.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_01: And they did hire me, but they made one condition.
[00:03:38] I had to take some Portuguese lessons
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_01: before I showed up three months later.
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_01: And I said, I'm happy to do it as long as you pay for them.
[00:03:46] And that's how I met my wife.
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_01: She was your teacher.
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_01: She was my teacher.
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_01: She was technically a teacher.
[00:03:51] SPEAKER_01: The way it really worked is I called my Brazilian friends.
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_01: And I said, can you find a very smart, very attractive
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_01: Brazilian PhD master somewhere in the Boston area?
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_01: And I have someone that will pay her to talk to me.
[00:04:04] And that's, I've still married 25 years later.
[00:04:08] What have you learned from Alex and from his team?
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_00: The founders of 3G, the original three founders,
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_01: are incredible people to my work
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_01: with in the beginning of my career.
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_01: And I won sort of a book.
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_01: This is 2003.
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_01: The company I had co-founded was going through trouble.
[00:04:29] SPEAKER_01: I took some time off.
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_01: And I wanted to answer the question
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_01: of how does one make money in countries with so much troubles?
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_01: I mean, Brazil in the 90s and in the first decade
[00:04:42] SPEAKER_01: of the century was incredibly turbulent.
[00:04:44] SPEAKER_01: I mean, crisis after crisis after crisis.
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_01: Very hard to make, to create wealth, to build companies
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_01: with sort of, it's like navigating through the fog.
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_01: You can move very slowly.
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_01: And there's things that can come at you from different ways.
[00:04:58] SPEAKER_01: I partnered with this professor, this mentor,
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_01: a mind from Harvard College.
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_01: He was teaching at Harvard Business School, Don So.
[00:05:05] SPEAKER_01: And what we did was paired company analysis.
[00:05:09] SPEAKER_01: Look, 10 very successful companies in Brazil
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_01: that had made tremendous wealth creation in the crazy 90s.
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_01: But look at their actions in contrast
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_01: to 10 much less successful companies during the same period of time.
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_01: And the test was these were pairs of companies
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_01: that looked similar in size and value
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_01: at the beginning of the 90s.
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_01: But by the end of the 90s, one was at least five
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_01: X more valuable than the other.
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_01: So that was the control group.
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_01: And that's how we studied.
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_01: And one of the companies is the beer company, Brahma,
[00:05:41] SPEAKER_01: that the Georgia Paul D'Oleman and Marcel Tevis
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_01: and Beto Cicapira had bought in 1989.
[00:05:48] That was competing against the other being company called
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_01: Antarctica, that was owned by the Germans and at a foundation.
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_01: Who in 1989 was a better, more profitable, more valuable
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_01: company.
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_01: But by a decade later, when these two merged,
[00:06:05] the Brahma shareholders kept 95% of the equity value.
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_01: So it was 10 X by the creation relative to the comparison twin.
[00:06:14] How did they do it?
[00:06:16] They're great spear fisherman.
[00:06:19] You don't chase the fish.
[00:06:22] You wait.
[00:06:24] SPEAKER_01: Well, you decide where you're going to anchor it.
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_01: You drop down with no equipment other than the spear
[00:06:31] and you hold your breath for one minute, for two minute.
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_01: You let little fish go by because you're not there to hunt little fish.
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_01: You're waiting for the big fish.
[00:06:42] SPEAKER_01: And then when you're almost running out of oxygen,
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_01: you've got two or three seconds to get the big fish and then go up
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_01: as you're both feeling the lack of oxygen.
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_01: He's feeling a spear through his chest.
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_01: But it's an exercise of waiting.
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_01: Why do they say these are great spear fishermen?
[00:06:58] SPEAKER_01: The step number one is spear fishing.
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_01: It's deciding where you're going to anchor.
[00:07:02] In looking to buy their beer company,
[00:07:04] they started to think about it five years before.
[00:07:08] There were owners of the number one investment bank in Brazil, bank of Argentina.
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_01: They were making tons of money out of volatility and inflation
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_01: because in high inflation periods,
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_01: you can make a lot of money if you are smart with math and finance.
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_01: But they knew inflation would end one day.
[00:07:25] And they said, we want to buy a company that will benefit
[00:07:29] from a low inflation rising consumption.
[00:07:34] Beer is one such company.
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_01: But they waited five years for this company to come for sale.
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_01: And it came for sale two weeks before an election.
[00:07:45] SPEAKER_01: When the Swiss owners got scared that a socialist was going to become president,
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_01: Ula first time government, and he was from the workers party.
[00:07:55] And they called them and it's just, can you do a deal in a week?
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_01: We'd like to get out of town.
[00:08:01] We don't want to take the risk of socialist.
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_01: And then the big deal was in trouble when the big devaluation
[00:08:07] SPEAKER_01: and closed the deal in three months.
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_01: And then he waited another seven years to do a deal with interbroupe
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_01: and then the biggest of all deals waited a following decade
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_01: to do a deal with a house or bush.
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_01: And then he waited 10 years to get out of town.
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_01: And then he waited another seven years to do a deal with interbroupe
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_01: and then he waited a following decade to do a deal with an house or bush.
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_00: And basically over this period, $80 million,
[00:08:38] initial investment in Brahma became a $60 billion plus,
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_01: excluding dividends.
[00:08:47] SPEAKER_01: But they're a great fisherman.
[00:08:50] And they wait for the big fish.
[00:08:52] SPEAKER_01: And as a concept, that is something I've learned from them,
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_01: which is every four or five years,
[00:09:01] SPEAKER_01: there's a once in a generation opportunity
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_01: that you have to be ready and be willing to move quickly to capture.
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_01: And if you do, you can create this proportionate value
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_01: for your company, for your investors, for your employees.
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_01: Do you have a story of your own that is the closest
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_00: to a great spearfishing outing?
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_00: I wasn't an entrepreneur.
[00:09:22] SPEAKER_01: I was set out by these three guys to go and find great interpranural
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_01: companies and invest $500 million in 20 companies.
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_01: You got 18 months go in month three.
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_01: That was your mission.
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_01: That was my mission.
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_01: That was my mission.
[00:09:34] SPEAKER_01: The mission number one out of business school.
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_01: Now that I was speaking Portuguese, I could go.
[00:09:40] And by month three, I remember talking to a buddy of mine
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_01: through our benchmarking different models.
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_01: And a buddy of mine had taken a job in the US,
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_01: company the web public and the dot com area, clearly a bubble,
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_01: being valued at 20 times revenue, which
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_01: sounds quaint by today's standards, by the 1998 standards.
[00:10:02] SPEAKER_01: And I said, Dennis, it's a bubble.
[00:10:06] How does it feel to be in a bubble?
[00:10:09] And he said to me, you grab my hand and said,
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_01: Martin, it feels better than being outside the bubble.
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_01: And I was like, he's absolutely right.
[00:10:17] SPEAKER_01: I have to go into this bubble.
[00:10:19] SPEAKER_01: I'm on the wrong side of the table.
[00:10:21] SPEAKER_01: So very quickly, I left the fund.
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_01: And within I think three months, we had raised $80 million
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_01: to launch somebody in the dot com, which was the eCommerce Amazon
[00:10:33] SPEAKER_01: dot com merged with Alibaba to take on Brazil.
[00:10:38] SPEAKER_01: And that happened very, very quickly.
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_01: A second time after we saw my business during the GFC,
[00:10:45] SPEAKER_01: I was working for another fund briefly.
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_01: And looking to buy a fixed income exchange of Brazil,
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_01: it's a dominant platform, 80% in the dot margin business.
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_01: A lot of competition.
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_01: And then all of a sudden, the GFC happened.
[00:11:02] And everyone dropped out.
[00:11:04] Everyone.
[00:11:05] And I was like, no, you're double down.
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_01: And we were able to buy a market dominant, high margin
[00:11:12] business that's six times even down.
[00:11:15] And we did it in two months.
[00:11:17] And people were like, what do you mean you're
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_01: doing something with the GFC?
[00:11:20] SPEAKER_01: And I said, if we're not willing to buy a dominant platform
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_01: a six times EBITDA, we should shut down.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_00: The world means the world is ending.
[00:11:29] SPEAKER_01: And we should, the world is not ending.
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_01: A dominant platform will always be
[00:11:33] SPEAKER_01: bored more than six times even that.
[00:11:36] SPEAKER_01: And there's been every three or four years, there's
[00:11:38] SPEAKER_01: one such unique distortion that you have to move very quickly.
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_01: That's perhaps one of the learnings
[00:11:44] SPEAKER_01: of being an entrepreneur in the dot com.
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_01: Like I'm a rare investor that has been an operator.
[00:11:48] SPEAKER_01: But it's not just that I had been an operator.
[00:11:52] What the dot com taught me, and I just
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_01: realized this recently, you can do seven years of work
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_01: in one year.
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_00: Say more about it.
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_00: Like when Elon Musk says, do your 10-year plan
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_01: and try to get it done in one year?
[00:12:07] SPEAKER_01: You're like, he's crazy.
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_01: Look what he's built.
[00:12:10] SPEAKER_01: And in the dot com, it felt like the world was on steroids.
[00:12:15] SPEAKER_01: Like in Sumerian, on the only have we raised $80 million
[00:12:17] SPEAKER_01: within the first three months.
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_01: Within one year, I was in charge of international.
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_01: We opened Sumerino in six countries.
[00:12:25] SPEAKER_01: With warehouses and customers and registrations and teams,
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_01: it was done in one year.
[00:12:31] If you had told me how early it would take a normal person
[00:12:34] SPEAKER_01: to do that, I would say three to four years going fast.
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_01: And we were like, no, we have to do it.
[00:12:40] SPEAKER_01: This is the first mover will be incredibly valuable.
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_01: We did it in one year.
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_01: So it's this ability to move very, very fast,
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_01: to capture opportunities which are fleeting,
[00:12:52] which seem humanly impossible.
[00:12:54] SPEAKER_01: We're actually not.
[00:12:56] This seems like a moment of that is happening
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_00: to maybe on megasteroids.
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_00: I think of a company like Cognition
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_00: as a recent example that I know well,
[00:13:04] SPEAKER_00: where the pace of growth of the business
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_00: is just sort of hard to believe that it's possible.
[00:13:09] SPEAKER_00: It's serving developers, maybe previously a company
[00:13:12] SPEAKER_00: like Stripe, which is one of the great companies
[00:13:14] SPEAKER_00: in the US and the technology world is a certain size.
[00:13:17] SPEAKER_00: It's grown that size over 15 years.
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_00: And these things are growing at a pace
[00:13:21] SPEAKER_00: that is, it's sort of hard to wrap one's head around.
[00:13:24] SPEAKER_00: And so I'm curious how you think about that
[00:13:26] SPEAKER_00: in the current moment right now.
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_00: But also what lessons you learned about
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_00: what it takes to go to put a 10 year plan into one year.
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_00: Like what is different about the behavior
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_00: in that compressed one year period
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_00: that makes that possible?
[00:13:40] So this is like my fourth or fifth bubble.
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_01: And all bubbles are born out of a truly transformative
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_01: technology.
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_01: Technology.
[00:13:49] SPEAKER_01: And in all the previous bubbles,
[00:13:53] SPEAKER_01: the promise was spectacular.
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_01: The short term was disappointing.
[00:13:58] SPEAKER_01: And the long term delivered more than expected.
[00:14:02] SPEAKER_01: But in that process, a lot of fortunes were made and destroyed.
[00:14:07] SPEAKER_01: So I think as a firm, John Thlegs is
[00:14:10] SPEAKER_01: been around for 45 years.
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_01: We try to make different mistakes in each bubble.
[00:14:15] SPEAKER_01: And I'm sure we're getting a new.
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:14:18] SPEAKER_01: Our approach this time, different from the internet,
[00:14:22] SPEAKER_01: has been to be incredibly aggressive
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_01: at deploying AI in the portfolio.
[00:14:28] The promise of AI is clear to everyone.
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_01: Let's see which working in the real world
[00:14:33] SPEAKER_01: and let's share Brex practices.
[00:14:35] SPEAKER_01: And we have an incredible scale.
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_01: Over 200 portfolio companies.
[00:14:39] SPEAKER_01: We have 100 people in our portfolio support,
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_01: portfolio operations team.
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_01: This year, we'll do 500 projects with the portfolio.
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_01: A third of them are AI projects.
[00:14:48] SPEAKER_01: So we're seeing what works in the front lines.
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_01: And as soon as we see a use case with real ROI
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_01: and real revenue to the provider of the service,
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_01: and you can sort of model what the economics
[00:15:03] SPEAKER_01: and the cost to serve and what the long term profitability
[00:15:05] SPEAKER_01: maybe is of this exciting new market, then we bounce.
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_01: The first one where we felt that has happened
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_01: is co-generation.
[00:15:14] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, co-generation and cursor and all that.
[00:15:16] SPEAKER_00: And it's just happened right now in the last 12 months.
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_01: It's crazy.
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_01: I mean, based on public information,
[00:15:21] SPEAKER_01: on topic revenues in co-chair,
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_01: went from 200 million to four over 4 billion in 12 months.
[00:15:26] SPEAKER_01: In B2B, that kind of growth has not happened ever, ever.
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_01: And it's so exciting.
[00:15:31] SPEAKER_01: And it's working in real life and programmers are happy.
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_01: And then all of a sudden,
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_01: you get this new reality where human programmers
[00:15:38] SPEAKER_01: are hyper-productive and they're working alongside
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_01: agentic programmers who have no moral north star
[00:15:43] SPEAKER_01: and do not sleep.
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_01: And how you get them to work together to a common output
[00:15:47] SPEAKER_01: which is super sensitive to you,
[00:15:49] SPEAKER_01: the client who's running on a software.
[00:15:52] Super exciting.
[00:15:52] That's one area.
[00:15:54] Marketing optimization, obviously.
[00:15:57] SPEAKER_01: It's machine learning on steroids.
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_01: And we're investors in liftoff,
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_01: which is very much on this.
[00:16:03] SPEAKER_01: We're investors in a software company called Insider
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_01: that does enterprise marketing optimization.
[00:16:08] SPEAKER_01: Data, companies turbocharged with AI.
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_01: We're investors in an Israeli company called VI.
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_01: There's so much, it's super exciting.
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_01: It's super risky.
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_01: We're probably going to look back and say,
[00:16:19] SPEAKER_01: we weren't bold enough in going for the killer app
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_01: soon enough, but we've been bold enough before
[00:16:23] SPEAKER_01: and it didn't pay to go very early.
[00:16:25] SPEAKER_01: And I think what's really interesting about GA,
[00:16:30] SPEAKER_01: we've been around for 45 years
[00:16:32] through all these technological cycles.
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_01: And we've been international for 30 years.
[00:16:38] SPEAKER_01: We've been in emerging markets for 25 years.
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_01: So we take on a lot of risk, macro risk.
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_01: We take on a lot of technology risk
[00:16:46] SPEAKER_01: because we are investing across,
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_01: we call 18 power alleys that cut across five sectors.
[00:16:52] Guess what our loss ratio is?
[00:16:55] Tell me.
[00:16:56] 4% on capital or on capital.
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_00: Oh, capital.
[00:17:02] For this kind of like we,
[00:17:04] SPEAKER_01: when venture in growth equity lost ratios of 20 to 40%
[00:17:08] SPEAKER_01: are common.
[00:17:09] But there's something about the way we deal with risk
[00:17:13] SPEAKER_01: that allows us to capture what we think
[00:17:14] SPEAKER_01: our recently good returns.
[00:17:16] SPEAKER_01: And that's surprising the low risk ratio.
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_01: And it has to do I think with an appetite for risk.
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_01: We don't take binary risk.
[00:17:26] For us, when we do this sort of the scenario planning
[00:17:29] SPEAKER_01: of 3 to 1000 scenarios on one dozen in one mind,
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_01: you do when you think of an investment,
[00:17:35] SPEAKER_01: for us a worst case scenario,
[00:17:37] SPEAKER_01: a company grows into the valuation we paid for it.
[00:17:42] SPEAKER_01: And that limits what you do.
[00:17:44] It limits the timing of where you go into a new industry.
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_01: You probably leave some money on the table,
[00:17:50] but you also leave a lot of risk on the table.
[00:17:54] And that product of you know,
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_01: reasonable returns with low risk,
[00:17:58] is a great product.
[00:18:00] I have 95% of my nerve worth in that product.
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_01: My life's sleep well at night.
[00:18:03] SPEAKER_01: I have a vastly undiversified portfolio of, you know,
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_01: two assets, G.A. and Treasuries.
[00:18:09] SPEAKER_01: The 45 years ago,
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_00: the sort of origin story of G.A.
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_00: itself is so interesting.
[00:18:14] SPEAKER_00: Chuck Fini is such an interesting character.
[00:18:16] SPEAKER_00: How does his spirit loom in the business
[00:18:21] SPEAKER_00: and in your personal consciousness?
[00:18:23] SPEAKER_00: He's the accidental billionaire.
[00:18:26] SPEAKER_01: Got the idea of duty-freeze by looking at naval bases
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_01: where commerce was free in the Pacific during the career war,
[00:18:33] SPEAKER_01: start building these duty-free shops,
[00:18:34] SPEAKER_01: becomes a billionaire sales to Louis Vuitton.
[00:18:37] And he's confronted with the question,
[00:18:40] what is the purpose of wealth?
[00:18:42] What do I do this is wealth?
[00:18:44] And his answer resonated really well with me.
[00:18:48] The purpose of wealth is to improve the human condition.
[00:18:51] Now, not tomorrow.
[00:18:54] No, because the present value of happier life
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_01: for more people now is very valuable.
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_01: So he wants to give it all away.
[00:19:05] Forget giving half away.
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_01: He's like, my dream is my last check will bounce.
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_01: I want to die a poor man and I want to give it all.
[00:19:15] SPEAKER_01: But before I give it all,
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_01: I believe you can create additional wealth
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_01: by investing in innovation,
[00:19:22] by backing great entrepreneurs globally.
[00:19:25] And he said, you, a GA,
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_01: as the original founding team at GA,
[00:19:30] SPEAKER_01: go back to the world's best entrepreneurs.
[00:19:33] SPEAKER_01: Be a good partner and know that all the proceeds
[00:19:36] SPEAKER_01: of our work will go to great causes.
[00:19:38] SPEAKER_01: And we've been doing that for 45 years.
[00:19:40] SPEAKER_01: Backing great innovators everywhere.
[00:19:44] We've invested in over 500 companies
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_01: over the last 45 years,
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_01: half of our investments have been outside of the United States.
[00:19:52] SPEAKER_01: And we've seen the power of innovation to create wealth globally.
[00:19:57] SPEAKER_01: This is not a privilege just to the US,
[00:19:59] SPEAKER_01: it's not a privilege just to the European.
[00:20:01] SPEAKER_01: And this concept of what is the purpose of wealth
[00:20:07] is also meaningful personally.
[00:20:09] SPEAKER_01: I think when I think of the wealth I'm creating
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_01: and the people that are work with all creating,
[00:20:14] SPEAKER_01: we're all incredibly thoughtful of how we allocate
[00:20:18] SPEAKER_01: our time and wealth to make the world better.
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_01: And the ways that are meaningful to us,
[00:20:23] SPEAKER_01: and there's no right and wrong.
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_01: But I find that accumulating wealth is,
[00:20:27] SPEAKER_01: is makes you gloated and slow.
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_01: Using your body and your life as a channel of, you know,
[00:20:34] SPEAKER_01: wealth that comes, but it goes to places that can be made better.
[00:20:37] SPEAKER_01: But it's a beautiful way to approach life.
[00:20:40] SPEAKER_01: And particularly if you're in the profession of allocating
[00:20:43] SPEAKER_01: other people's wealth into great innovators,
[00:20:46] SPEAKER_01: it all makes sense.
[00:20:48] SPEAKER_01: It all fits in internally consistent.
[00:20:51] SPEAKER_01: And that's why we've been around for 45 years.
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_01: There are not that many.
[00:20:54] SPEAKER_01: You can count them in both hands
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_01: if the number of firms that are investors in tech and innovation
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_01: that have been around have been successful this long.
[00:21:03] And I think it has to do with the internally consistent vision,
[00:21:08] SPEAKER_01: mission and plan that Chuck had for GA.
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_00: That's not a normal origin story for a firm like this.
[00:21:15] SPEAKER_00: Usually it's really just purely commercial enterprise,
[00:21:17] SPEAKER_00: some young investors set off and build a firm.
[00:21:20] SPEAKER_00: This was different.
[00:21:21] SPEAKER_00: What else about that founding DNA
[00:21:23] SPEAKER_00: makes the setup of the firm unique?
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_00: How does his original vision and setup allow you
[00:21:27] SPEAKER_00: to act differently than others do today?
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_00: There's this phrase written into our founding documents,
[00:21:34] SPEAKER_01: which is we're good partners to each other,
[00:21:37] to our founders and to our clients.
[00:21:39] SPEAKER_01: The partnership ethos is fundamental.
[00:21:42] And when you look at 45 years of references of 500 people
[00:21:46] with how many companies, thousands of people we partner with,
[00:21:50] and you say, what do you think of GA?
[00:21:52] SPEAKER_01: They're good partners, they're good guys, they're good people.
[00:21:55] SPEAKER_01: They say they do what they say they're going to do.
[00:21:57] SPEAKER_01: They put the company's interest first.
[00:22:00] SPEAKER_01: Sometimes we're accused of being dolphins in a sea of sharks.
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_01: And I'd love to be a dolphin.
[00:22:04] SPEAKER_01: Who wants to be a shark?
[00:22:06] SPEAKER_01: Dolphins have much better life.
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_01: So I think that's a big part of the firms DNA.
[00:22:12] SPEAKER_01: So I'll give you an example.
[00:22:14] SPEAKER_01: I ran our general athletics Latin America program
[00:22:17] SPEAKER_01: for the first seven years of my career at general athletics.
[00:22:20] SPEAKER_01: And in all the Dolphins sessions, they asked me,
[00:22:24] SPEAKER_01: what's, how did you do it?
[00:22:25] SPEAKER_01: How did you make money in the one neighborhood
[00:22:27] SPEAKER_01: that no one makes money because of it?
[00:22:29] SPEAKER_01: This is fear.
[00:22:30] SPEAKER_01: No, I just, I don't go, that's part of the reason.
[00:22:34] SPEAKER_01: But the other reason is I say the reason we do well in Latin America,
[00:22:41] SPEAKER_01: is we don't have a Latin America fund.
[00:22:44] Because if we had a Latin America fund,
[00:22:45] SPEAKER_01: we're going to put money into Latin America.
[00:22:47] SPEAKER_01: We're going to buy at the top of the bottom.
[00:22:49] SPEAKER_01: And you know what, if you want to make money, you do the opposite.
[00:22:51] SPEAKER_01: You buy at the bottom, you sell the top.
[00:22:54] SPEAKER_01: And they're like, oh, interesting.
[00:22:56] SPEAKER_01: Why don't other people do it?
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_01: It turns out it's really hard to do.
[00:23:00] To have a team in Latin America, or in China, or in India,
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_01: or in Southeast Asia, compete for attention and money
[00:23:11] SPEAKER_01: through a one-global IC.
[00:23:13] It's so hard to do unless your culture is about partnership.
[00:23:19] SPEAKER_01: The culture demands good partnership.
[00:23:22] SPEAKER_01: And the culture expels behavior that's not consistent.
[00:23:27] We've been a good partner.
[00:23:28] We're structured in a way that, first,
[00:23:31] SPEAKER_01: we are the largest investor in our own product by design.
[00:23:35] SPEAKER_01: Right now, we have about the employees of General Atlantic
[00:23:38] SPEAKER_01: have about 8% of the funds we have ministers over $5 billion
[00:23:42] SPEAKER_01: over our own capital.
[00:23:44] This does not feel like managing other people's money.
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_01: These fields, my day to day, I'm managing my family
[00:23:51] SPEAKER_01: wealth, first and foremost.
[00:23:53] SPEAKER_01: And I'm doing it with care and with intention and purpose.
[00:23:57] The way we fundraise is different also.
[00:24:02] SPEAKER_01: One of the problems with the industry
[00:24:04] SPEAKER_01: is the five-year fundraiser cycle.
[00:24:07] To be able to raise your next fund,
[00:24:09] SPEAKER_01: you have to deploy at a certain speed.
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_01: And you need to return capital to certain cadence,
[00:24:14] SPEAKER_01: otherwise you don't get to do the next fund.
[00:24:16] SPEAKER_01: And if there is a winter of risk like we've had for the last three
[00:24:21] SPEAKER_01: years, you're at a dry powder exactly at the time,
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_01: but things are on sale.
[00:24:28] So the traditional fundraising, five-year cycle
[00:24:30] SPEAKER_01: creates lots of distortions and pain for our industry.
[00:24:34] We have an Evergreen, hybrid Evergreen fund raising cycle.
[00:24:38] SPEAKER_01: Meaning, yes, every two to three years,
[00:24:39] SPEAKER_01: we have a normal fund.
[00:24:40] SPEAKER_01: So if you want a normal fund, come to GA every two or three years.
[00:24:43] SPEAKER_01: Perfect.
[00:24:44] SPEAKER_01: But if you're a large institution and are willing to do
[00:24:47] SPEAKER_01: a standard managed account, you can come in anytime.
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_01: And the two structures invest at the same portfolio
[00:24:54] SPEAKER_01: from here forward.
[00:24:55] SPEAKER_01: There's never conflict of buying the legacy.
[00:24:57] SPEAKER_01: But the advantage of that is there's no fundraising cliffs.
[00:25:01] SPEAKER_01: We're always fundraising.
[00:25:02] SPEAKER_01: It's always steady.
[00:25:04] SPEAKER_01: There's no big jumps.
[00:25:04] SPEAKER_01: There's no pressure to liquidate something
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_01: to meet some artificial target.
[00:25:08] SPEAKER_01: That makes our lives so much easier.
[00:25:11] SPEAKER_01: And then the third component that I think is distinctive,
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_01: which I hate it initially, because we have a communist system
[00:25:19] SPEAKER_01: of compensation, which is you all get a percent
[00:25:22] SPEAKER_01: of the total performance, not your individual performance.
[00:25:25] SPEAKER_01: That's all you can do.
[00:25:26] SPEAKER_01: I'm a mirror fisherman.
[00:25:29] SPEAKER_01: I'm a mirror fisherman.
[00:25:30] SPEAKER_01: I guess something special after me.
[00:25:32] SPEAKER_01: I mean, this communism didn't work in the Soviet Union.
[00:25:35] SPEAKER_01: Why is it like a...
[00:25:37] And then I saw how it changed everything
[00:25:40] in that the level of collaboration is fantastic.
[00:25:44] And the way you prevent the Soviet union from happening
[00:25:48] is if you're not pulling your weight, you're not on the boat.
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_01: So it's a meritocracy in that you...
[00:25:53] SPEAKER_01: To be in this community where we all
[00:25:55] SPEAKER_01: win together and lose together, we all have to be effective
[00:25:59] SPEAKER_01: and bringing as much into the partners
[00:26:01] SPEAKER_01: that we're taking away from it.
[00:26:02] SPEAKER_01: And that's what keeps the health and meritocracy of the system.
[00:26:05] SPEAKER_01: But there isn't a hyper-insensitive to be hyper-productive
[00:26:09] SPEAKER_01: because if I have hyper-productive,
[00:26:10] SPEAKER_01: I'll make more wins in that game.
[00:26:12] No, it's much more about winning as a team,
[00:26:14] SPEAKER_01: as opposed to winning as an individual.
[00:26:19] SPEAKER_00: The dual structure, which is unusual, not common,
[00:26:23] SPEAKER_00: what are the negatives or trade-offs associated with that?
[00:26:27] SPEAKER_00: Do the fund investors get upset that they don't really know
[00:26:30] SPEAKER_00: what percent of the total they're going to get?
[00:26:33] SPEAKER_01: There's two very serious trade-offs.
[00:26:36] SPEAKER_01: First of all, it takes forever to explain.
[00:26:38] SPEAKER_01: LAUGHTER
[00:26:40] A beauty scale right here.
[00:26:42] SPEAKER_01: And they're like, why do you have two series?
[00:26:45] SPEAKER_01: What's one is better, which one is worse?
[00:26:47] SPEAKER_01: I can get it, why this is good for you?
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_01: But how is it good for me?
[00:26:51] SPEAKER_01: So instead of the onboarding experience is a painful experience.
[00:26:57] SPEAKER_01: The other downside is fundraising is a perpetual activity.
[00:27:02] Whereas for a lot of my competitors every five years,
[00:27:06] SPEAKER_01: it's a six-month sprint that all they do is fundraise
[00:27:10] SPEAKER_01: and then they can not fundraise for another four and a half years.
[00:27:13] It's kind of like binge-dieting.
[00:27:15] SPEAKER_01: You only do it once every six years.
[00:27:17] SPEAKER_01: And for us, it's a no-brainer.
[00:27:19] SPEAKER_01: This structure that leads to more productive deployment
[00:27:23] of camera.
[00:27:24] SPEAKER_01: My friend, John Kim, who is a very well known fundraiser
[00:27:27] SPEAKER_00: at General Catalyst, has this simple equation,
[00:27:29] SPEAKER_00: which is that persuasion equals desire minus fear.
[00:27:33] What have you learned about fundraising,
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_00: given that you've had to do it as a firm on a constant basis?
[00:27:39] I think most humans go from formative fear.
[00:27:43] And one of the traps of our industry
[00:27:46] SPEAKER_01: is you can only fundraise when things are very expensive,
[00:27:50] SPEAKER_01: because that's what everyone's on the floor.
[00:27:52] Have you been able to invert that fear to FOMO problem
[00:27:55] SPEAKER_00: so that you can, if you have been able to raise some money
[00:27:58] SPEAKER_00: in the harder times, what is the key to doing that well?
[00:28:01] SPEAKER_00: There's always someone in the world that has excess capital,
[00:28:05] even in a time of fear.
[00:28:08] And you go there.
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_01: I do this like in Brazil, one other of our tricks,
[00:28:13] SPEAKER_01: our strategies to navigate global complexity
[00:28:18] is in every geography we're in,
[00:28:21] we have the best families,
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_01: the most entrepreneurial families become investors,
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_01: and we cultivate them, not necessarily for their money,
[00:28:28] SPEAKER_01: but for their insights around the country
[00:28:31] SPEAKER_01: and around the entrepreneurs we wish we partner.
[00:28:32] SPEAKER_01: It takes a really long time.
[00:28:34] And a lot of those families are typically entrepreneurial,
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_01: they're like, no, no, I don't invest in funds.
[00:28:38] SPEAKER_01: I invest directly because I create a business
[00:28:40] SPEAKER_01: and I'm so good and I'm good at getting the big fish.
[00:28:43] SPEAKER_01: And I'm like, I ask them a very simple question.
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_01: I say, hey, what percent of your net worth
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_01: do you have in Brazil?
[00:28:51] And they're like, hmm, like liquid net worth?
[00:28:54] SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, no, total net worth.
[00:28:57] And they're like, hmm, the numbers typically between 90
[00:29:00] SPEAKER_01: and 95% say that's very interesting.
[00:29:03] SPEAKER_01: And I say close your eyes, imagine you're not Brazilian,
[00:29:08] you're a citizen of the world.
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_01: What percent of your wealth would you put in Brazil?
[00:29:13] SPEAKER_01: And they're like, oh, three percent.
[00:29:15] SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah, how about I help you?
[00:29:17] SPEAKER_01: I'll take a little closer to three, the 95 you're in.
[00:29:21] SPEAKER_01: So I find that argument to be generally effective
[00:29:25] SPEAKER_01: because it's genuinely in their best interest.
[00:29:28] And I think people have a natural tendency
[00:29:30] SPEAKER_01: to over invest in that in which they understand.
[00:29:33] SPEAKER_01: And of course, those families understand
[00:29:35] SPEAKER_01: what it is to invest in Brazil.
[00:29:37] SPEAKER_01: But in doing that, they're massively undiversified.
[00:29:40] And the world has become really, really risky.
[00:29:43] And there's only one free lunch in finance.
[00:29:46] SPEAKER_01: Remember that from now?
[00:29:48] SPEAKER_01: The diversification is the only free lunch.
[00:29:51] SPEAKER_01: So thinking strategically of how to diversify
[00:29:55] SPEAKER_01: with whom to diversify is hard, but super valuable
[00:30:00] SPEAKER_01: if you want that free lunch.
[00:30:02] Speaking of diversification, maybe the most interesting dimension
[00:30:04] SPEAKER_00: of that today is geographic.
[00:30:06] SPEAKER_00: We were talking before we had recorded about the incredibly
[00:30:10] SPEAKER_00: wide gulf between the pristine US equity assets
[00:30:14] SPEAKER_00: and basically everywhere else in the world.
[00:30:17] SPEAKER_00: There was a time when you saw this chart between the S&P 500
[00:30:20] SPEAKER_00: and the Acque World, XCUS or something.
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_00: And it was kind of back and forth and back and forth.
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_00: And then the line has just gone like this for 20 years
[00:30:27] SPEAKER_00: where the US has just so completely dominated
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_00: everybody else in enterprise value creation
[00:30:32] SPEAKER_00: or some measure like that.
[00:30:34] How do you interpret that shift?
[00:30:36] SPEAKER_00: Is it secular?
[00:30:37] SPEAKER_00: Is it going to be cyclical and go back
[00:30:39] SPEAKER_00: towards the international markets?
[00:30:41] SPEAKER_00: What do you think about that crazy bifurcation?
[00:30:45] The premium for XUS exceptionalism has never been higher.
[00:30:52] SPEAKER_01: US public equities are trading at 26 times earnings
[00:30:56] SPEAKER_01: for a 4% forecasted growth, which is at the 97th percentile
[00:31:02] SPEAKER_01: of the last 25 years.
[00:31:04] SPEAKER_01: And the US dollar, despite a 10% depreciation this year,
[00:31:07] SPEAKER_01: is pretty much a two standard deviations
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_01: far away from the neutral state.
[00:31:15] SPEAKER_01: So the US has never been this expensive.
[00:31:19] I love the US.
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_01: It's still the number one economy.
[00:31:21] SPEAKER_01: I see what have half my assets in the US,
[00:31:23] SPEAKER_01: but not 90% of my assets in the US.
[00:31:25] SPEAKER_01: Not only is it very expensive,
[00:31:27] SPEAKER_01: total debt to GDP is 125% of GDP.
[00:31:30] That is the highest of the OECD.
[00:31:32] SPEAKER_01: It's higher than it was after World War II
[00:31:35] SPEAKER_01: when America levered to defeat the axis of evil.
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_01: Current plans in place.
[00:31:39] SPEAKER_01: Within five years, we're going to be at 145% of GDP,
[00:31:44] SPEAKER_01: which is higher than Greece and Italy.
[00:31:47] And the US has not had a recession since 2009.
[00:31:50] Are you sure you want to have 95% of your assets
[00:31:52] SPEAKER_01: in the United States of America?
[00:31:54] I don't.
[00:31:56] SPEAKER_01: If you look at the rest of the world,
[00:31:59] SPEAKER_01: you can buy Europe at 14 times earnings.
[00:32:01] SPEAKER_01: You can buy Brazil at nine times earnings.
[00:32:03] SPEAKER_01: You can buy Mexico at 10 times earnings.
[00:32:05] We're finding 40%, 50% growers at 12 times EBITDA,
[00:32:09] SPEAKER_01: 14 times EBITDA, as many of them
[00:32:11] SPEAKER_01: serving dollarized clients.
[00:32:13] SPEAKER_01: So the case for global diversification,
[00:32:17] SPEAKER_01: the price for global earnings,
[00:32:21] SPEAKER_01: the cases that have been stronger,
[00:32:22] SPEAKER_01: the prices that have been lower on a relative basis.
[00:32:26] SPEAKER_01: So I do think that in the next 10 years,
[00:32:29] SPEAKER_01: those who achieve some level of diversification
[00:32:32] SPEAKER_01: will be rewarded.
[00:32:34] Because I do think there's a little bit of froth
[00:32:36] SPEAKER_01: in the US market and the opposite
[00:32:38] SPEAKER_01: in a lot of emerging markets.
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_01: What have you learned on any recent trips to China?
[00:32:42] SPEAKER_00: China's fascinating.
[00:32:44] And I've been going to China for 25 years.
[00:32:47] And I've seen the development.
[00:32:48] SPEAKER_01: It's the fastest change in terms of per capita GDP
[00:32:53] SPEAKER_01: in modern history or any country at scale.
[00:32:57] SPEAKER_01: It's an incredibly complex society.
[00:33:01] SPEAKER_01: Tremendous amount of innovation.
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_01: And we were lucky in having been early in China as GA.
[00:33:06] SPEAKER_01: We've been investing there from 25 years.
[00:33:08] SPEAKER_01: I am highly optimistic that tensions have stabilized
[00:33:13] SPEAKER_01: and that market conditions are improving.
[00:33:17] SPEAKER_01: And we've been underweight China for the last five years.
[00:33:21] SPEAKER_01: We just did two deals.
[00:33:23] SPEAKER_01: We're going to pick it up a little bit.
[00:33:25] SPEAKER_01: There's always binary risk around the geopolitics,
[00:33:28] SPEAKER_01: but there's so much innovation.
[00:33:30] SPEAKER_01: There's so much entrepreneurial zeal.
[00:33:33] SPEAKER_01: The one thing I learned, I actually
[00:33:34] SPEAKER_01: learned over drinks with a Chinese entrepreneur.
[00:33:37] SPEAKER_01: So I've done business in 19 countries.
[00:33:39] SPEAKER_01: And I love to connect on a human level with the entrepreneur.
[00:33:42] SPEAKER_01: So much, so much, even at growth stage,
[00:33:44] SPEAKER_01: so much of the assessment of the company
[00:33:47] SPEAKER_01: and of the partnership is about chemistry.
[00:33:50] SPEAKER_01: And it was very hard for me to build chemistry
[00:33:55] SPEAKER_01: with the Chinese entrepreneurs.
[00:33:56] SPEAKER_01: One night, I'm having a long dinner
[00:33:58] SPEAKER_01: with lots of good food and alcohol
[00:34:02] SPEAKER_01: with an entrepreneur who was an anthropology PhD
[00:34:05] SPEAKER_01: of University of Arkansas.
[00:34:07] SPEAKER_01: And I said, if someone can explain me the Chinese mentality,
[00:34:11] SPEAKER_01: it's this man.
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_01: He said to me, and like any oversimplification,
[00:34:16] SPEAKER_01: it's unfair, but there's a great truth.
[00:34:18] SPEAKER_01: And he said, well, you have to understand
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_01: about the entrepreneurs you're dealing with.
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_01: He said, these generations of entrepreneurs,
[00:34:26] people who are in their 30s and 40s,
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_01: they're all children of the cultural revolution.
[00:34:31] Everything was taken away from these factories, everything.
[00:34:37] And they are scarred, and they have something to prove
[00:34:41] because they think something was stolen,
[00:34:43] SPEAKER_01: and they will get it back.
[00:34:45] So there's a level of drive, an ethic, work ethic,
[00:34:49] that probably matches the refugees of World War II,
[00:34:52] SPEAKER_01: that came to the States and these great businesses
[00:34:55] SPEAKER_01: of World War II, or other people that have had hardship
[00:34:58] SPEAKER_01: in their life, but this applies to 98% of the entrepreneurs.
[00:35:04] And they saw it with their parents.
[00:35:06] So that's the other condition you should take into account.
[00:35:10] SPEAKER_00: How do your ancestors show up in your life and vice?
[00:35:16] Well, products of our traumas,
[00:35:19] and our adventures and our dreams is my worldview.
[00:35:23] SPEAKER_01: So what are my traumas?
[00:35:24] SPEAKER_01: Some are personal and some are generation.
[00:35:26] SPEAKER_01: The generational traumas, on my mother's side,
[00:35:32] Jewish family had to flee the Russian Empire
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_01: through Romania, the Argentina, then Bolivia.
[00:35:37] SPEAKER_01: So fleeing, leaving everything behind.
[00:35:39] SPEAKER_01: From my father's side, very wealthy,
[00:35:43] SPEAKER_01: landed oligarchy of Bolivia.
[00:35:46] In 1952, there's a revolution, they lose everything,
[00:35:50] SPEAKER_01: and their house and farms get burned down on the Amos time.
[00:35:54] When my father was a teenager.
[00:35:56] So on both sides, there's a sense of loss and escape.
[00:36:03] That is very present, and they decide to become communists
[00:36:07] SPEAKER_01: and doctors.
[00:36:08] SPEAKER_01: They're both doctors in public hospitals
[00:36:10] SPEAKER_01: and a little town in Bolivia.
[00:36:12] SPEAKER_01: So that's their trauma, which I relate to the cultural revolution.
[00:36:19] And they are religious, so not atheist.
[00:36:22] SPEAKER_01: In my personal life, the trauma,
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_01: trauma comes from two places for me.
[00:36:26] One is I grew up in Bolivia in the 80s, and that was chaos.
[00:36:30] SPEAKER_01: Bolivia in the 80s, seven presidents in 10 years,
[00:36:34] SPEAKER_01: you've learned four coup d'état.
[00:36:36] SPEAKER_01: We had inflation, you got 5% inflation.
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_01: We had 35,000% inflation.
[00:36:41] SPEAKER_01: So 10,000, 35,000.
[00:36:44] SPEAKER_00: 10,000, I understand, okay?
[00:36:46] SPEAKER_01: Like the only time my mom ever punished me
[00:36:49] SPEAKER_01: was one time she sent me to exchange her salary for dollars
[00:36:53] SPEAKER_01: when she got it.
[00:36:54] SPEAKER_01: And I took a one hour break to visit a friend.
[00:36:57] SPEAKER_01: And it lost half its value in that hour.
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_01: So I was grounded for a year
[00:37:03] SPEAKER_01: because of that one hour break.
[00:37:06] SPEAKER_01: So anyways, so there was also a lot of violence
[00:37:11] SPEAKER_01: because of ethnic violence in Bolivia.
[00:37:13] SPEAKER_01: So it was rough.
[00:37:15] SPEAKER_01: It felt unsafe.
[00:37:16] SPEAKER_01: It felt turbulent.
[00:37:18] SPEAKER_01: And then I have a genetic disorder.
[00:37:21] SPEAKER_01: I bruised very easily, like very, very easily.
[00:37:24] SPEAKER_01: So getting out of bed, deciding what activity to do
[00:37:27] SPEAKER_01: is a risk-reward trade-off since the age of five.
[00:37:32] And that is a way of seeing the world
[00:37:35] SPEAKER_01: that most people-
[00:37:36] SPEAKER_01: I risked that.
[00:37:36] SPEAKER_01: I know how to price risk.
[00:37:38] SPEAKER_01: I'm like, not worth it.
[00:37:40] SPEAKER_01: My friends are like, why are you always thinking
[00:37:42] SPEAKER_01: of the downside?
[00:37:43] SPEAKER_01: Well, I'm good at it.
[00:37:44] I've got my reasons.
[00:37:46] SPEAKER_01: So anyways, I find when trying to understand a person,
[00:37:50] SPEAKER_01: I do it with entrepreneurs,
[00:37:52] SPEAKER_01: seeing what their trauma was is super useful.
[00:37:55] SPEAKER_01: Because I find a lot of the most driven people
[00:37:59] SPEAKER_01: are driven because of foundational traumas.
[00:38:02] And if you understand them and your traumatize yourself,
[00:38:05] SPEAKER_01: you can relate and empathize.
[00:38:06] SPEAKER_01: But you also understand the intensity that drives them.
[00:38:11] SPEAKER_01: And whether they can manage it and channel it productivity.
[00:38:16] SPEAKER_01: But if you can, it is such a wonderful engine of transformation.
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_01: And it's curative.
[00:38:23] SPEAKER_01: It's healing to channel it in a positive way.
[00:38:27] Have you ever worked with somebody that did extremely well
[00:38:29] SPEAKER_00: with none of that trauma-based drive
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_00: who has just all adjusted and happy and kicked ass?
[00:38:37] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:38:38] She's looking for her.
[00:38:39] SPEAKER_01: Or her?
[00:38:40] SPEAKER_01: She right.
[00:38:41] And again, it doesn't need to be racked to riches.
[00:38:45] SPEAKER_01: It doesn't need to be a big disease.
[00:38:46] SPEAKER_01: It could be like I heard one of my fiercest competitors.
[00:38:52] He was cleaning, he was mowing the lawns of his buddies
[00:38:57] SPEAKER_01: who were with the cute girls.
[00:38:59] SPEAKER_01: And his entire life, he wanted to show them.
[00:39:02] I don't judge.
[00:39:03] SPEAKER_01: That's a real trauma.
[00:39:04] SPEAKER_00: Pain is pain.
[00:39:05] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:39:06] SPEAKER_00: So how did you learn to harness it?
[00:39:08] SPEAKER_00: Because the other end of the spectrum
[00:39:10] SPEAKER_00: could be unharmed and just chaos.
[00:39:13] SPEAKER_00: How do you learn to harness or channel it
[00:39:15] SPEAKER_00: to something productive?
[00:39:16] SPEAKER_00: Managing one's emotions productively requires either therapy,
[00:39:21] SPEAKER_01: writing a journal or meditating.
[00:39:22] SPEAKER_01: You should do two of the three.
[00:39:24] And I do.
[00:39:26] SPEAKER_01: Two of the three.
[00:39:27] Trying to do the third one was really hard.
[00:39:29] SPEAKER_01: Meditation?
[00:39:29] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:39:30] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:39:31] Yeah.
[00:39:32] I was just in the same page.
[00:39:34] SPEAKER_00: If I asked a bunch of people that knew you
[00:39:36] SPEAKER_00: and the investments that you've made across your career,
[00:39:39] SPEAKER_00: what is a you investment?
[00:39:41] SPEAKER_00: Like what are the characteristics where they see that company
[00:39:43] SPEAKER_00: and they're like, oh, you know, how would they describe it?
[00:39:45] This is a funny story.
[00:39:46] SPEAKER_01: I'll answer the question, but I'll answer the question.
[00:39:48] SPEAKER_01: Great round of question.
[00:39:49] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:39:49] SPEAKER_01: So when I got promoted to Chairman of the Investment Committee,
[00:39:52] SPEAKER_01: so elevated from my Latin America roll out my life
[00:39:55] SPEAKER_01: to head of the investment committee of General Atlantic,
[00:39:59] SPEAKER_01: iconic global loss.
[00:40:01] SPEAKER_01: It was lost.
[00:40:02] SPEAKER_01: So I go to the founding two founders.
[00:40:05] SPEAKER_01: Steve Denning was a CEO for the first 20 years.
[00:40:08] Army man, McKeezy man, Stanford MBA, structured.
[00:40:12] I say, Steve, how do I make decisions
[00:40:18] SPEAKER_01: across so many geographies and business models?
[00:40:22] SPEAKER_01: What's the framework you think I should apply to add value
[00:40:25] SPEAKER_01: to my partners?
[00:40:26] And he said you should develop a checklist
[00:40:29] that captures the characteristics of a winning GA deal.
[00:40:33] SPEAKER_01: So go back and look at our 25 years or history.
[00:40:36] SPEAKER_01: Our best deals.
[00:40:37] SPEAKER_01: I'll share a couple characteristics.
[00:40:39] SPEAKER_01: I give you the three M's, but they're probably
[00:40:41] SPEAKER_01: five P's as well, create a checklist.
[00:40:44] SPEAKER_01: And I was like, yeah, checklist.
[00:40:47] SPEAKER_01: Same day, I go to the co-founder.
[00:40:51] SPEAKER_01: Dave Hodgson.
[00:40:52] SPEAKER_01: He's just super glued, but just the smartest guy
[00:40:55] SPEAKER_01: in the room always.
[00:40:57] SPEAKER_01: And I asked him the same question.
[00:40:58] SPEAKER_01: And the first thing he says,
[00:41:01] refuse, avoid the temptation to use a checklist.
[00:41:05] SPEAKER_01: If it was as simple as a checklist,
[00:41:06] SPEAKER_01: we wouldn't get paid millions of dollars to do what we do.
[00:41:09] SPEAKER_01: And I was like, check this out.
[00:41:12] SPEAKER_01: So whenever there is a paradox, there's
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_01: an elegant unparadoxing of the paradox.
[00:41:17] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:41:18] SPEAKER_01: So Danny Kalim and think he fast think it's low.
[00:41:21] SPEAKER_01: Checkless manifesto built on work
[00:41:23] SPEAKER_01: he did for the Israeli defense forces
[00:41:25] SPEAKER_01: to create the checklist for the elite agents.
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_01: Turns out the checklist work, but in applying the IDF checklist,
[00:41:32] SPEAKER_01: there were these super interviews that
[00:41:36] SPEAKER_01: got even better results consistently
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_01: than just the average interview.
[00:41:41] SPEAKER_01: So there was something beyond the checklist
[00:41:43] SPEAKER_01: that was this really significant.
[00:41:48] And there's one interview of the super interviewer,
[00:41:50] SPEAKER_01: which she says, I do the checklist because I have to.
[00:41:54] But after I do the appraisal, I close it.
[00:41:57] And I close my eyes and see how I feel.
[00:42:00] SPEAKER_01: And I go with my gut.
[00:42:03] And she has perfect scores.
[00:42:06] SPEAKER_01: So the framework I use for what's
[00:42:10] SPEAKER_01: the perfect Martina or GA deal is the combination
[00:42:13] SPEAKER_01: of a checklist with my gut, which I call the educated
[00:42:16] SPEAKER_01: intuition.
[00:42:17] What's in the checklist of things we like?
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_01: Huge times, business models that create economic value
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_01: and have mode, teams with the right go forward capabilities.
[00:42:29] SPEAKER_01: Situations where there is an organic growth to get.
[00:42:31] SPEAKER_01: And there's tremendous amount of strategic value,
[00:42:33] SPEAKER_01: meaning someone will overpay to have this capability
[00:42:36] SPEAKER_01: if we are successful.
[00:42:38] SPEAKER_01: So those are the things that the checklist of aspires.
[00:42:42] Meet personally in the deals I've led.
[00:42:45] SPEAKER_01: They have to make the world better.
[00:42:48] SPEAKER_01: I am so proud that I invested in the number one
[00:42:51] SPEAKER_01: investing platform in Brazil when there were only 80,000 people
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_01: that owned stocks in Brazil.
[00:42:56] SPEAKER_01: And now 10 million people, owned stocks.
[00:42:58] SPEAKER_01: What's it called?
[00:42:59] SPEAKER_01: XP.
[00:42:59] SPEAKER_01: It's publicly traded.
[00:43:00] SPEAKER_01: 10 billion dollar market cap.
[00:43:01] SPEAKER_01: I invested when they were nothing.
[00:43:04] I am so proud that I went against every convention
[00:43:08] SPEAKER_01: and invested on an edtech company.
[00:43:10] SPEAKER_01: Edtech was a dark alley.
[00:43:12] SPEAKER_01: We have power alleys.
[00:43:13] SPEAKER_01: There are some places we don't touch.
[00:43:15] SPEAKER_01: And I say, no, no, no, this is different.
[00:43:17] SPEAKER_01: This is different.
[00:43:18] SPEAKER_01: This little company in the Northeast of Brazil,
[00:43:20] SPEAKER_01: which was creating K through 12 learning systems,
[00:43:22] SPEAKER_01: which is sort of a, instead of using textbooks,
[00:43:25] SPEAKER_01: you package everything in a hybrid notebook with digital,
[00:43:28] SPEAKER_01: that it went from 80,000 students to eight million students,
[00:43:33] SPEAKER_01: eight million kids every day today.
[00:43:36] SPEAKER_01: Use this platform.
[00:43:37] SPEAKER_01: And it's world class.
[00:43:39] SPEAKER_01: It's really good content.
[00:43:41] SPEAKER_01: And it's an amazing entrepreneur, son of a teacher.
[00:43:44] SPEAKER_01: And we made money.
[00:43:46] SPEAKER_01: We have a platform that 97% of financial institutions
[00:43:51] SPEAKER_01: use for digital onboarding.
[00:43:53] SPEAKER_01: Turns out Brazil is the world capital of online fraud.
[00:43:56] SPEAKER_01: And this is the one company that catches it.
[00:43:59] And I am so proud that I started mentoring this kid
[00:44:01] SPEAKER_01: when his company was nothing.
[00:44:03] SPEAKER_01: And I did it through Endeavor.
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_01: It took me eight years before I had,
[00:44:06] SPEAKER_01: became investable for J&M.
[00:44:07] SPEAKER_01: And we invested and now they're dominant.
[00:44:09] SPEAKER_01: And so if they makes the world better,
[00:44:12] SPEAKER_01: I, you see, I got out.
[00:44:14] SPEAKER_01: It's beyond money.
[00:44:15] SPEAKER_01: It's centers.
[00:44:16] SPEAKER_01: If the checklist is mined and the instinct is gut,
[00:44:21] SPEAKER_00: have you met a great investor who's mostly heart?
[00:44:29] SPEAKER_01: No, I think heart is super important
[00:44:34] SPEAKER_01: if you want to be a leader of a large organization.
[00:44:37] Because you have to move the hearts of hundreds, thousands
[00:44:40] SPEAKER_01: of people to row in this same direction with purpose
[00:44:43] and with effectiveness.
[00:44:45] And that is crucial.
[00:44:47] And the heart is so powerful.
[00:44:49] SPEAKER_01: It overrides gut and brain.
[00:44:52] And to do it at scale, you see these people
[00:44:55] SPEAKER_01: that are super good leaders.
[00:44:57] The energy is captivating.
[00:45:00] SPEAKER_01: And they are wizards of the trade.
[00:45:03] It's really hard to do all three.
[00:45:06] SPEAKER_01: And part of being a good investor
[00:45:09] is to not fall in love.
[00:45:12] Because at the end of the day, you have a fiduciary duty
[00:45:16] to produce returns.
[00:45:18] And you have to make some tough calls.
[00:45:20] And love is a treacherous thing.
[00:45:23] So funny story.
[00:45:25] SPEAKER_01: So the one time that I didn't follow the checklist was for love.
[00:45:30] SPEAKER_01: So obviously, I had a checklist for the woman
[00:45:33] SPEAKER_01: I'm going to marry.
[00:45:35] SPEAKER_01: And when I met Daniella, my poor, used teacher,
[00:45:37] SPEAKER_01: she didn't score very high on the checklist.
[00:45:40] SPEAKER_00: Where was she deficient?
[00:45:41] SPEAKER_00: I will say.
[00:45:42] SPEAKER_01: But things that are absolutely relevant to the task at hand.
[00:45:45] SPEAKER_01: I had the wrong framework.
[00:45:48] SPEAKER_01: And she was perfect in every way.
[00:45:49] SPEAKER_01: And she's been perfect in every way.
[00:45:51] So it matters of the heart.
[00:45:53] Forget the checklist.
[00:45:55] SPEAKER_01: But I don't think the three of them
[00:45:57] SPEAKER_01: come together in the investment push.
[00:45:59] You mentioned the two founders.
[00:46:00] SPEAKER_00: What about Bill Fort?
[00:46:01] SPEAKER_00: What have you learned from him?
[00:46:02] SPEAKER_00: Oh, Bill.
[00:46:05] So much.
[00:46:06] SPEAKER_01: So I think I've worked with Bill for 15 years.
[00:46:09] SPEAKER_01: I actually pitched Bill my startup.
[00:46:12] SPEAKER_01: And this is 1998, came in through New York.
[00:46:16] SPEAKER_01: And I had heard a lot about General Atlantic
[00:46:18] SPEAKER_01: and how they're different.
[00:46:19] SPEAKER_01: They think long term, they're good partners,
[00:46:20] SPEAKER_01: and Chuck Fini, and I don't know.
[00:46:22] SPEAKER_01: It's really hard to get the meeting.
[00:46:23] SPEAKER_01: We give them the meeting.
[00:46:24] SPEAKER_01: Bill and I really hit it off.
[00:46:26] SPEAKER_01: I made the pitch.
[00:46:27] SPEAKER_01: And he's like, we're not ready for Brazil.
[00:46:31] SPEAKER_01: I'm really sorry.
[00:46:32] SPEAKER_01: That was heartbroken because I really wanted GA.
[00:46:35] SPEAKER_01: And Bill was an amazing guy.
[00:46:37] SPEAKER_01: 10 years later, after I sold my business,
[00:46:39] SPEAKER_01: I was working at another fund.
[00:46:41] SPEAKER_01: He called me and I was like, remember me.
[00:46:43] SPEAKER_01: I was like, yeah, I remember you.
[00:46:45] He's like, can we try this again?
[00:46:46] SPEAKER_01: I was like, yeah, we can try this again.
[00:46:48] SPEAKER_01: But just for you know, you would have made 18 times your money.
[00:46:50] SPEAKER_01: You had to say, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
[00:46:52] SPEAKER_01: I know, I know.
[00:46:53] SPEAKER_01: So come, Bill has an incredible ability to see our end corners
[00:47:00] SPEAKER_01: and be visionary in making bets before they're obvious.
[00:47:05] SPEAKER_01: So going into Europe, going to the emerging markets,
[00:47:07] SPEAKER_01: going into consumer, going into life sciences,
[00:47:10] SPEAKER_01: pushing me now to go into robotics and humanoid
[00:47:12] SPEAKER_01: and I'll be able to do anything.
[00:47:13] SPEAKER_01: No, we need to go to it.
[00:47:15] SPEAKER_01: So he's an incredible ability to look around corners.
[00:47:19] SPEAKER_01: He also in managing the partnership and us has hard.
[00:47:26] Not for investment decision making,
[00:47:28] SPEAKER_01: but in keeping our culture, the meritocracy of the firm,
[00:47:33] SPEAKER_01: also with heart has helped me develop as a leader of G.A.
[00:47:38] SPEAKER_01: and letting from the heart.
[00:47:40] SPEAKER_01: And as an incredible money maker, so his mind helps to.
[00:47:44] SPEAKER_01: That was too.
[00:47:44] SPEAKER_01: Not too deep.
[00:47:47] As you've progressed in your investing specific career,
[00:47:51] what changes the most as you become more seniors?
[00:47:54] SPEAKER_00: How does it feel the most different doing it today
[00:47:56] SPEAKER_00: versus doing it when you're a, you know, lots to prove young analysts?
[00:48:00] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:48:01] SPEAKER_01: The hardest thing when you're young is developing patience
[00:48:04] SPEAKER_01: and the conviction that you can wait a little longer
[00:48:06] SPEAKER_01: for the big fish.
[00:48:08] SPEAKER_01: You're young.
[00:48:09] SPEAKER_01: It's up or down.
[00:48:10] SPEAKER_01: You want to get going.
[00:48:11] SPEAKER_01: You want to get deal experience.
[00:48:12] SPEAKER_01: You want to get notches on your belt.
[00:48:13] SPEAKER_01: And that's completely wrong, wrong instinct.
[00:48:16] When you're older, you have a lot more range.
[00:48:18] SPEAKER_01: You've seen a lot more.
[00:48:19] SPEAKER_01: And you got patience.
[00:48:20] SPEAKER_01: You're like, nothing scares me.
[00:48:23] SPEAKER_01: I know a big fish will come.
[00:48:24] SPEAKER_01: Come.
[00:48:25] SPEAKER_01: No pressure.
[00:48:29] You are less in the front lines and more
[00:48:32] SPEAKER_01: as a coach player, helping training young partners
[00:48:36] SPEAKER_01: to do what you used to do.
[00:48:38] And initially, that can be very demotivating
[00:48:41] because Tom Brady likes to be in the field, not coaching
[00:48:45] SPEAKER_01: or opining the...
[00:48:46] SPEAKER_01: I'm not a fox.
[00:48:47] SPEAKER_01: Maybe not.
[00:48:49] SPEAKER_01: Not so fun.
[00:48:51] SPEAKER_01: Until you reimagine the game and you live
[00:48:54] vicariously through the people you're training
[00:48:56] SPEAKER_01: and you enjoy their wins almost as much as you enjoy your wins.
[00:49:00] SPEAKER_01: That's been the mental flip that I had to do
[00:49:04] SPEAKER_01: to enjoy this face.
[00:49:05] SPEAKER_01: Because of course scoring goals is better than coaching.
[00:49:08] SPEAKER_01: Of course.
[00:49:09] SPEAKER_01: Unless you make the mental shift that live vicariously through them.
[00:49:13] SPEAKER_01: The hard thing, and that's why there's not that many venture
[00:49:18] and growth equity investors over every day to 50.
[00:49:22] It's not just that we call it in rich or we get tired
[00:49:25] SPEAKER_01: or we develop new interest.
[00:49:27] SPEAKER_01: I think our brain ages and stops being plastic.
[00:49:31] SPEAKER_01: So one of the great learnings from a beautiful mind
[00:49:35] SPEAKER_01: at Hodson, whose age beautiful is since late 60s
[00:49:39] SPEAKER_01: and is very sharp and very much on top of the new trends.
[00:49:44] He defies the convention and I said,
[00:49:45] SPEAKER_01: what is the secret to forget Peter Atte?
[00:49:49] SPEAKER_01: I want to hear from you.
[00:49:50] SPEAKER_01: I just want the brain.
[00:49:52] SPEAKER_01: I don't care about my VO8 and the max.
[00:49:55] SPEAKER_01: I want the young brain.
[00:49:57] SPEAKER_01: And he said three things the most important one is
[00:50:00] SPEAKER_01: I refuse to think like an old man.
[00:50:02] My mind's still place.
[00:50:05] I still wonder.
[00:50:06] SPEAKER_01: I'm still in awe.
[00:50:08] And I don't fall into the trap of thinking I have the answer
[00:50:11] SPEAKER_01: to everything.
[00:50:12] I'm always learning experimenting and playing.
[00:50:15] And that's the hardest part because we have this illusion
[00:50:19] SPEAKER_01: as we get older that there's no room for play.
[00:50:22] There's no room for play.
[00:50:24] There's always room for play.
[00:50:26] How do you inject that into your life?
[00:50:28] SPEAKER_01: You just don't take yourself too seriously.
[00:50:30] I'm always laughing, but everything.
[00:50:32] Making fun of everything.
[00:50:33] SPEAKER_01: Even when confronted with the worst perfect storm
[00:50:38] SPEAKER_01: or something happens, I start laughing and I say,
[00:50:41] SPEAKER_01: what are the odds?
[00:50:42] SPEAKER_01: So many bad things could happen all at once.
[00:50:45] SPEAKER_01: It's just never happened before.
[00:50:47] SPEAKER_01: Send other things at the same time.
[00:50:49] SPEAKER_01: Let's go right through it.
[00:50:51] SPEAKER_01: That attitude, I think, makes life a lot more fun.
[00:50:56] SPEAKER_00: So what do you make of this current bubble
[00:50:59] SPEAKER_00: that were inside, outside, depending
[00:51:01] SPEAKER_00: on the person you mentioned, humanoid,
[00:51:03] SPEAKER_00: you mentioned, buy a little bit.
[00:51:05] SPEAKER_00: There's all this exciting stuff happening, probably
[00:51:10] SPEAKER_00: all of which in the long one will be amazing for people.
[00:51:12] SPEAKER_00: Be a lot of consumers for plus and all this.
[00:51:15] SPEAKER_00: You want to make money through this process
[00:51:17] SPEAKER_00: for yourself and your partners.
[00:51:20] How does it feel to you?
[00:51:21] SPEAKER_00: This is more meaningful because it will
[00:51:24] SPEAKER_01: touch a higher percentage of GDP.
[00:51:26] SPEAKER_00: The internet was the other very meaningful one,
[00:51:29] SPEAKER_01: but it changed how we interact with each other.
[00:51:31] SPEAKER_01: This will change much more than that.
[00:51:33] Unambiguous recommendation.
[00:51:35] If you're in your 20s or early 30s, go work at AI.
[00:51:39] Because you're going to live through dog years.
[00:51:41] SPEAKER_01: Meaning we were talking about seven years of activity
[00:51:44] SPEAKER_01: in one year.
[00:51:45] SPEAKER_01: And regardless of whether that company does well
[00:51:49] SPEAKER_01: or you make money, you're going to have compressed learning
[00:51:53] SPEAKER_01: that only happens once every 20 years.
[00:51:55] SPEAKER_01: So don't miss that opportunity.
[00:51:56] SPEAKER_01: And when I say that age group, I mean that mental age group.
[00:51:59] SPEAKER_01: You could be in your 50s and be in that mental.
[00:52:01] SPEAKER_01: You're ready to take risks.
[00:52:02] SPEAKER_01: Just go do it.
[00:52:03] SPEAKER_01: If you have a young mind today, go working at it.
[00:52:05] SPEAKER_01: Because it's going to be so much fun and the learning
[00:52:08] SPEAKER_01: and I think investing is risky.
[00:52:11] SPEAKER_01: Our approach which may prove to be too conservative
[00:52:14] SPEAKER_01: was to take a slow.
[00:52:16] Because it's not clear yet where the value is going to be created.
[00:52:21] SPEAKER_01: It's not clear yet how much more powerful
[00:52:25] SPEAKER_01: the large language models are versus why
[00:52:27] SPEAKER_01: others that are more efficient.
[00:52:30] SPEAKER_01: Or how much of the value will be captured by the models
[00:52:33] SPEAKER_01: versus the applications.
[00:52:34] SPEAKER_01: So it's exciting to watch.
[00:52:37] SPEAKER_01: I know we're going to have a moment where we're all going
[00:52:39] SPEAKER_01: to wake up and say we've invested too much.
[00:52:41] SPEAKER_01: I don't know if it's three years away or eight months.
[00:52:44] SPEAKER_01: I don't think it's have no, for sure hasn't happened yet.
[00:52:47] SPEAKER_01: So you don't think there's a chance that we're like kind of at.
[00:52:50] SPEAKER_00: We're in that moment already.
[00:52:51] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:52:52] SPEAKER_00: Why or not?
[00:52:53] SPEAKER_00: It's not crazy enough.
[00:52:55] I was looking at some stats at comparing the AI wave.
[00:53:00] Let's not call it a bubble wave to the dot com
[00:53:04] SPEAKER_01: onto the railroads.
[00:53:06] SPEAKER_01: And it's looking at the ratio of Capex to revenue
[00:53:09] SPEAKER_01: and what percent of GDP was involved in this.
[00:53:12] SPEAKER_01: And how was this Capex funded?
[00:53:16] And Capex to revenue is still not crazy.
[00:53:19] And new revenue streams are managing.
[00:53:21] SPEAKER_01: And the biggest difference relative to railroads and dot com
[00:53:25] is the funds are coming from really rich companies.
[00:53:29] SPEAKER_01: The magnificent six who are printing money
[00:53:33] SPEAKER_01: out of their dominant positions are reinvesting a lot
[00:53:36] SPEAKER_01: of this money into the Capex that's
[00:53:38] SPEAKER_01: powering all this innovation.
[00:53:40] SPEAKER_01: Such a very healthy.
[00:53:42] It's not junk bonds, speculators, or thin margin telecom
[00:53:46] SPEAKER_01: companies that are levering up the wazoo with retail money
[00:53:50] SPEAKER_01: to fund this wave of innovation.
[00:53:53] SPEAKER_01: It's really profitable company.
[00:53:54] SPEAKER_01: So I think it's got more legs.
[00:53:57] Will it be bumpy?
[00:53:57] Yes.
[00:53:59] SPEAKER_01: But the thing about predicting the future is it's really hard.
[00:54:03] SPEAKER_01: It's playing the past a lot easier.
[00:54:05] I'm always interested in this difference
[00:54:07] between risk, which I think of as sometimes quantifiable
[00:54:11] SPEAKER_00: or imaginable, and pure uncertainty.
[00:54:14] SPEAKER_00: Like we literally just don't know what's going to happen.
[00:54:18] SPEAKER_00: And if you think about where you've made money,
[00:54:21] SPEAKER_00: how much do you think came from the unskilling
[00:54:23] SPEAKER_00: this to like embrace uncertainty versus taking really
[00:54:26] SPEAKER_00: calculated risks?
[00:54:29] Listen, you never invest a lot of money
[00:54:37] SPEAKER_01: without a visibility what you're doing.
[00:54:41] SPEAKER_01: There is fog and different layers of fog.
[00:54:43] SPEAKER_01: And what the fog does is it slows you down.
[00:54:47] SPEAKER_01: But if you look pierced through, you see clarity.
[00:54:50] SPEAKER_01: You see a monopolist at six times the beta.
[00:54:53] SPEAKER_01: You see an opportunity to take.
[00:54:55] SPEAKER_01: It's not a shot in the dark and hope for the best.
[00:54:58] And what you can't do is just shut down and say,
[00:55:03] SPEAKER_01: this is too rough, too unpredictable.
[00:55:06] SPEAKER_01: You just have to engage with the unpredictability
[00:55:09] SPEAKER_01: until you see something before others
[00:55:12] SPEAKER_01: and you strike for the fish.
[00:55:14] SPEAKER_01: In an era like this one, it's all changing so fast.
[00:55:16] SPEAKER_00: And understanding the core technologies is important.
[00:55:19] SPEAKER_00: How do you personally learn?
[00:55:21] SPEAKER_00: Like what is your preferred method to stay abreast
[00:55:24] SPEAKER_00: of what is going on and like stay in touch with reality?
[00:55:28] Talk to young people.
[00:55:29] Surf TikTok.
[00:55:31] Try different apps, try crazy things.
[00:55:35] SPEAKER_01: Go to places where there are no old people.
[00:55:38] SPEAKER_01: And you don't care.
[00:55:38] SPEAKER_01: I don't care.
[00:55:39] SPEAKER_01: Someone calls me old time.
[00:55:40] SPEAKER_01: I'm just playing.
[00:55:42] SPEAKER_01: So it's just keep it fresh.
[00:55:45] Value is in the new.
[00:55:48] Being the new, always.
[00:55:51] Even if it turns out to be at that end,
[00:55:54] most of what we do is that ends.
[00:55:56] SPEAKER_01: But it doesn't mean it was invaluable to try it.
[00:56:00] SPEAKER_01: That's the hardest thing.
[00:56:01] SPEAKER_01: There's been this wild transformation of our industry
[00:56:05] SPEAKER_00: in the time that you've been a professional in it.
[00:56:08] SPEAKER_00: What does the competitive dynamic feel like to you today?
[00:56:11] SPEAKER_00: There's so many smart.
[00:56:13] The universe of amazing companies has expanded.
[00:56:16] The number of $100 million revenue
[00:56:18] SPEAKER_01: in the business growing 40%, 50% has grown 10x.
[00:56:22] SPEAKER_01: Because more technology, more people taking risk in more places.
[00:56:27] SPEAKER_01: Unfortunately, we compete against 19,000 GPs.
[00:56:31] SPEAKER_01: It was not a very nice thing to say.
[00:56:33] SPEAKER_01: But it's one of my competitors said there's more GPs
[00:56:36] SPEAKER_01: than McDonald's and NGN.
[00:56:39] SPEAKER_01: Which is one of those GPs that are smaller.
[00:56:41] SPEAKER_01: They don't feel the way we compare them.
[00:56:42] SPEAKER_01: No, it's too many GPs.
[00:56:44] SPEAKER_01: And the industry is consolidated.
[00:56:46] SPEAKER_01: It's becoming incredibly competitive.
[00:56:48] You have to have more clarity
[00:56:49] SPEAKER_01: what is your competitive edge.
[00:56:51] How are we thought about our edge?
[00:56:55] Brand.
[00:56:56] We've built this brand about being good partners.
[00:56:58] SPEAKER_01: This brand meets something.
[00:57:00] SPEAKER_01: And people get value from GA inside.
[00:57:03] SPEAKER_01: That tracks help some recruit talent, get clients,
[00:57:06] SPEAKER_01: go public.
[00:57:08] Scale to have muscles that small shops on have.
[00:57:12] SPEAKER_01: We have a hundred people in operations.
[00:57:14] SPEAKER_01: They can help you with pricing, sales force, effectiveness,
[00:57:16] SPEAKER_01: AI for what customer serves.
[00:57:18] SPEAKER_01: Whatever you need, we got a team.
[00:57:20] SPEAKER_01: It's there for free.
[00:57:21] SPEAKER_01: We got for our scale.
[00:57:22] SPEAKER_01: We got an in-house human time team that
[00:57:25] SPEAKER_01: has taps into a database of 15,000 better executives.
[00:57:29] SPEAKER_01: That you need a CTO who sent your list tomorrow.
[00:57:31] SPEAKER_01: Eight guys in the area who we've worked with.
[00:57:34] SPEAKER_01: And I think fit.
[00:57:35] SPEAKER_01: That's an area.
[00:57:37] SPEAKER_01: And then you have to be a specialist.
[00:57:39] I can't be a generalist anymore.
[00:57:40] SPEAKER_01: So we've chosen what we call the GA Power Alley.
[00:57:43] SPEAKER_01: There are 16 Power Alley things like AI applications,
[00:57:45] SPEAKER_01: value-based, care, digital payments, 16 Power Alley,
[00:57:49] SPEAKER_01: check the website.
[00:57:50] SPEAKER_01: In those Power Alleys, we think we're among the best
[00:57:52] SPEAKER_01: in the world.
[00:57:53] And we show up with 32 case studies.
[00:57:56] SPEAKER_01: We've done this 32 times.
[00:57:58] SPEAKER_01: And yes, you can copy things that work.
[00:58:00] SPEAKER_01: But guess what?
[00:58:01] SPEAKER_01: You don't know the things that didn't work that we tried.
[00:58:04] SPEAKER_01: That we're going to prevent you from trying.
[00:58:07] So it's made it harder to compete.
[00:58:11] But I do think scale and experience helps.
[00:58:15] SPEAKER_01: Provided you are deliberate at learning from the experience
[00:58:19] SPEAKER_01: and focused on how you build capabilities with scale
[00:58:22] SPEAKER_01: in areas that really matter.
[00:58:23] SPEAKER_01: Not just look good in the website.
[00:58:26] If you're teaching a seminar about or four young investors
[00:58:29] SPEAKER_00: who are only allowed to go invest in non-US companies,
[00:58:33] SPEAKER_00: so everything but the US, what are the most important things
[00:58:37] SPEAKER_00: for that crew to know about doing that well?
[00:58:40] SPEAKER_00: That's distinct from what I would take to do well in the US.
[00:58:44] There's a lot more volatility.
[00:58:47] So the frequency of surprises is much higher.
[00:58:51] SPEAKER_01: So agility is super important.
[00:58:57] We're also low trust cultures.
[00:59:00] SPEAKER_01: Even though most of them are religious,
[00:59:02] SPEAKER_01: doesn't mean you can trust.
[00:59:06] SPEAKER_01: So higher percentage of the time, you
[00:59:09] SPEAKER_01: may find yourself with a crook across the table.
[00:59:13] SPEAKER_01: So the value of referencing is much more important.
[00:59:18] SPEAKER_01: And how to do a good reference is super important,
[00:59:20] SPEAKER_01: because people don't say bad things about other people easily.
[00:59:24] SPEAKER_01: So that's another one.
[00:59:26] SPEAKER_01: The third one, which is a positive one,
[00:59:28] SPEAKER_01: which is the one great advantage of being outside the US,
[00:59:32] SPEAKER_01: is there so many things that don't work well?
[00:59:35] That's what we're hanging through.
[00:59:37] Shobong is lower hanging fruit.
[00:59:41] SPEAKER_01: And if you provide a great service,
[00:59:44] SPEAKER_01: you capture a lot of money for a really long time.
[00:59:47] How do you do a good reference?
[00:59:49] For an investment, you do it with a family
[00:59:53] SPEAKER_01: that has given you money to make investments.
[00:59:55] SPEAKER_01: And you say, Zron, we're about to invest $200 million
[01:00:00] SPEAKER_01: in this entrepreneur.
[01:00:02] You know his father.
[01:00:03] SPEAKER_01: You know his grandfather.
[01:00:05] SPEAKER_01: Do you think we should take this risk?
[01:00:07] And he's like, oh, no fucking way.
[01:00:09] SPEAKER_01: He's a crook, son of a crook.
[01:00:13] Because he has money with you, he tells you the truth.
[01:00:17] SPEAKER_01: If you didn't have money with you, he would say,
[01:00:20] SPEAKER_01: at worst you'd say, I don't know.
[01:00:21] SPEAKER_01: There's some noise that would do my homework or they're fine.
[01:00:25] Now, for hiring is another hack, which I learned,
[01:00:30] SPEAKER_01: which is so important.
[01:00:31] SPEAKER_01: So much of life is getting the right people in the bus.
[01:00:34] SPEAKER_01: And when you're going to do a reference on a hire,
[01:00:37] you call the person and you say, hey, I'm about to help.
[01:00:41] We're considering David for this role.
[01:00:43] SPEAKER_01: This role involves the following five challenges.
[01:00:47] SPEAKER_01: Bob, Bob, Bob.
[01:00:49] SPEAKER_01: This is a very important decision for my company
[01:00:54] because we can't get this wrong.
[01:00:56] It's also a very big decision for David
[01:00:58] SPEAKER_01: because he's happy at his job.
[01:01:00] And if he gets this wrong, if we
[01:01:01] SPEAKER_01: get this wrong, we've wasted time and he's out of a job.
[01:01:05] Help me assess if this is a good risk for me and David.
[01:01:09] And if you can have an honest discussion,
[01:01:11] SPEAKER_01: if you don't feel comfortable engaging like this,
[01:01:13] SPEAKER_01: let's not talk about it, but that's
[01:01:14] SPEAKER_01: what I need the reference for.
[01:01:16] You'd be surprised.
[01:01:17] SPEAKER_01: People are like, well, for that risk, David,
[01:01:19] SPEAKER_01: now it's leaving there, he's fine.
[01:01:21] SPEAKER_01: But that is a genuine way to answer it
[01:01:24] SPEAKER_01: because what I described is actually true.
[01:01:26] SPEAKER_01: If this is a bad fit, David should not be taking this job.
[01:01:31] SPEAKER_01: Refers calls are not, tell me about David.
[01:01:34] SPEAKER_01: Is he a good guy?
[01:01:35] That's a waste of time because people say,
[01:01:37] SPEAKER_01: yeah, he's a great guy.
[01:01:39] SPEAKER_01: He's a great guy.
[01:01:39] SPEAKER_01: Very competent.
[01:01:40] SPEAKER_01: What if you learned about managing, help manage
[01:01:44] SPEAKER_00: the career success of investors, which
[01:01:46] SPEAKER_00: is a very distinctive job from a career ladder
[01:01:49] SPEAKER_00: and a company or something incentives matter a lot.
[01:01:52] SPEAKER_00: I'm sure I'm curious what you've learned about incentives.
[01:01:56] SPEAKER_00: What mistakes have you made?
[01:01:58] SPEAKER_00: If you think about you being responsible
[01:01:59] SPEAKER_00: for other investors and you wanting them to thrive,
[01:02:02] SPEAKER_00: what's the good, the bad, and the ugly?
[01:02:05] SPEAKER_01: It's an apprenticeship business.
[01:02:06] SPEAKER_01: So pairing them up with different people,
[01:02:08] SPEAKER_01: different skills, different styles is super important.
[01:02:11] SPEAKER_01: Helping them from a very young age
[01:02:14] to make recommendations.
[01:02:18] Don't just do the task.
[01:02:21] Answer this or what?
[01:02:22] SPEAKER_01: And ultimately, say, what's my level of conviction
[01:02:25] SPEAKER_01: in doing this investment?
[01:02:27] Don't rely just on this more senior people.
[01:02:30] SPEAKER_01: Actually, one of the tricks I used to do
[01:02:32] SPEAKER_01: with it is I've been in three investment committees
[01:02:33] SPEAKER_01: in my career, in the three G, in the admin.
[01:02:37] SPEAKER_01: I would try to understand the mind of each investment
[01:02:42] SPEAKER_01: committee member and predict what they're going to ask.
[01:02:46] SPEAKER_01: So I would read the memo and say,
[01:02:47] SPEAKER_01: Georgia Paul is going to ask this.
[01:02:49] SPEAKER_01: Bill Ford is going to ask this.
[01:02:51] SPEAKER_01: Juan Carlos Torres is going to ask this.
[01:02:53] SPEAKER_01: And I'll also predict their vote.
[01:02:57] By the end of a year of doing this,
[01:02:59] SPEAKER_01: I was up to 80, 90%.
[01:03:02] SPEAKER_01: And it was really interesting.
[01:03:03] SPEAKER_01: It was forced me not only to have my own opinion
[01:03:05] SPEAKER_01: about a deal, because I'd read the materials,
[01:03:08] but look at it from the perspective of someone
[01:03:10] SPEAKER_01: who's really good at making these kind of decisions.
[01:03:13] SPEAKER_01: And my ambition was to one day be completely unpredictable
[01:03:18] SPEAKER_01: when someone tried to do this with me
[01:03:20] SPEAKER_01: in when I became a senior person,
[01:03:21] SPEAKER_01: because I was capturing learnings from 30 perspective.
[01:03:25] SPEAKER_01: It's not true.
[01:03:26] SPEAKER_01: I'm actually pretty predictable by now.
[01:03:28] SPEAKER_01: But it's learning vicariously by forcing yourself
[01:03:34] SPEAKER_01: to have opinions and also putting yourselves
[01:03:36] SPEAKER_01: in the minds of people who are proven investors
[01:03:39] SPEAKER_01: is a way of their apprenticeship on steroids.
[01:03:42] SPEAKER_01: And one of the things that we do at GA,
[01:03:44] SPEAKER_01: which I'm really proud of, because it's
[01:03:45] SPEAKER_01: culturally very hard to do, our investment committees
[01:03:48] SPEAKER_01: are open to everyone.
[01:03:49] SPEAKER_01: The whole firm.
[01:03:50] SPEAKER_01: The whole firm, the investment professions.
[01:03:52] SPEAKER_01: So every Tuesday, 190 people sign up.
[01:03:55] SPEAKER_01: And there's no presenting.
[01:03:57] SPEAKER_01: We come in directly to Shark Tag just questions.
[01:04:01] SPEAKER_01: And it's beautiful.
[01:04:03] SPEAKER_01: So it's talking through how that meeting works.
[01:04:04] SPEAKER_00: So one person, like a sponsor is proposing a deal.
[01:04:07] SPEAKER_00: So there's a deal team, the deal team,
[01:04:09] SPEAKER_01: is typically a combinational sector and a geoport together.
[01:04:12] SPEAKER_01: They standardize materials with the checklist.
[01:04:15] SPEAKER_01: It gets distributed by Friday, Tuesday, we come in.
[01:04:19] There's no presenting that the deal lead,
[01:04:21] SPEAKER_01: there's always a deal lead, the main sponsor,
[01:04:24] SPEAKER_01: is there to answer questions.
[01:04:26] SPEAKER_01: And we have five investment committee members
[01:04:28] SPEAKER_01: and the IC robot, which also opines.
[01:04:31] SPEAKER_01: And we just ask you questions.
[01:04:32] SPEAKER_01: Let's see, IC robot.
[01:04:34] SPEAKER_01: So we've been training the six member of the IC
[01:04:38] SPEAKER_01: based on 45 years of data.
[01:04:40] SPEAKER_01: And we do that.
[01:04:41] SPEAKER_01: So she votes on all our deals.
[01:04:43] SPEAKER_01: And we've been having her do this for the last three years.
[01:04:47] SPEAKER_01: We call her a new.
[01:04:48] SPEAKER_01: Is she any good?
[01:04:49] SPEAKER_00: So we've back tested her.
[01:04:51] SPEAKER_00: And she's much better than humans.
[01:04:54] But it turns out someone who's been trained in the past
[01:04:56] SPEAKER_01: is very good at the past.
[01:04:58] SPEAKER_01: We only have three years of concurrent data.
[01:05:01] SPEAKER_01: So we need to wait another four or five years.
[01:05:03] SPEAKER_01: I'm hoping that by the time we retire,
[01:05:05] SPEAKER_01: I retire about 10 years, should be better than the humans.
[01:05:09] SPEAKER_00: If I was doing that, if I could somehow
[01:05:10] SPEAKER_00: do that exercise with you, or I could predict
[01:05:12] SPEAKER_00: the sorts of questions that you tend to ask about companies,
[01:05:15] SPEAKER_00: what are they?
[01:05:16] SPEAKER_00: What are the big ones that you find yourself constantly
[01:05:18] SPEAKER_00: asking sponsors who are promoting a deal?
[01:05:21] Yeah.
[01:05:23] SPEAKER_01: Getting in the mind of the founder.
[01:05:26] SPEAKER_01: His or her motivations, why this is so special
[01:05:29] SPEAKER_01: and the trajectory that got to this.
[01:05:31] SPEAKER_01: I try to meet the founders outside the MSP community
[01:05:33] SPEAKER_01: process as a sponsor.
[01:05:36] SPEAKER_01: Basis of competition, sort of true, distinct competitive
[01:05:40] SPEAKER_01: advantage and durability of the competitive advantage.
[01:05:44] SPEAKER_01: And then I try to push people on the tails,
[01:05:49] SPEAKER_01: both positive and negative.
[01:05:51] SPEAKER_01: These six bad things happen.
[01:05:54] How bad is it?
[01:05:56] SPEAKER_01: And how likely is it?
[01:05:57] SPEAKER_01: Or if this amazing development happens,
[01:06:00] SPEAKER_01: which could be amazing, unlikely is.
[01:06:03] SPEAKER_01: And who else would benefit?
[01:06:04] SPEAKER_01: So I always find the tails to be the most interesting.
[01:06:07] SPEAKER_01: Because if you look at the distribution of our returns,
[01:06:10] 10% of our best deals, how we get lucky.
[01:06:13] SPEAKER_01: And they produce 50% of the return.
[01:06:15] So we lose money very little.
[01:06:17] SPEAKER_01: And then 10% will get 5x plus.
[01:06:19] SPEAKER_01: And these are really important.
[01:06:21] SPEAKER_01: And these, all of them are better than the upside-case
[01:06:25] SPEAKER_01: in our memos.
[01:06:26] SPEAKER_01: Because good things happen that we did not see coming,
[01:06:31] SPEAKER_01: but God bless and thank God.
[01:06:33] SPEAKER_01: So I always find like, where are the lottery tickets?
[01:06:35] SPEAKER_01: How do you assess how?
[01:06:37] SPEAKER_00: It seems like, first of all, incredibly important,
[01:06:39] SPEAKER_00: like all the data.
[01:06:40] SPEAKER_00: We know how important the right tail is
[01:06:42] SPEAKER_00: for investing outcomes.
[01:06:43] SPEAKER_00: It's like, well, we'll warrant truth at this point.
[01:06:46] How does one get better at assessing the option value
[01:06:49] SPEAKER_00: embedded in a given business?
[01:06:51] SPEAKER_00: That just seems so crucial.
[01:06:54] SPEAKER_00: But there's no book about that.
[01:06:56] SPEAKER_00: There's no podcast about that.
[01:06:59] SPEAKER_00: You've got 10 investments.
[01:07:00] SPEAKER_00: How do you know which of the 10 has more embedded
[01:07:02] SPEAKER_00: like right-side options about?
[01:07:03] SPEAKER_00: So the pattern recognition from having seen
[01:07:07] SPEAKER_01: the winning lottery tickets gives you some help.
[01:07:13] SPEAKER_01: If you've seen more of these, you begin to see
[01:07:15] SPEAKER_01: how you can get lucky.
[01:07:19] SPEAKER_01: As important in all those lucky scenarios,
[01:07:23] there was a spearfisher man at the top
[01:07:26] SPEAKER_01: to capture an opportunity that was available to Benny,
[01:07:30] but they seized it.
[01:07:32] So it's a lot more about the capital locator at the top.
[01:07:36] SPEAKER_01: The CEO is he someone that can spearfish.
[01:07:42] SPEAKER_01: And some people, it takes one to know when.
[01:07:45] SPEAKER_01: Some people are really good at it.
[01:07:46] SPEAKER_01: Some people are not spearfishing it.
[01:07:48] SPEAKER_01: What is your unfinished business professionally?
[01:07:52] So I could not think of a better activity
[01:07:57] SPEAKER_01: than working in growth equity at Gerrathlactic
[01:08:00] SPEAKER_01: for the next 10 years.
[01:08:02] Global growth equity in the middle of the air revolution
[01:08:05] SPEAKER_01: with the seniority that I have and the dry powder.
[01:08:08] SPEAKER_01: It'll pinch me, pinch me because I hope I don't die
[01:08:11] SPEAKER_01: on a plane crash because it's gonna be great.
[01:08:14] So now after that, and I think you have to start thinking,
[01:08:19] SPEAKER_01: I've been active mentoring and topreneurs through Endeavor,
[01:08:22] SPEAKER_01: which is an offer for Profitman in the board
[01:08:23] SPEAKER_01: and I've been doing this for 25 years.
[01:08:25] SPEAKER_01: I actually started mentoring, which is an interesting tip.
[01:08:29] When my business was running out of cash,
[01:08:32] and after this, the comms sounds exciting,
[01:08:34] SPEAKER_01: but there was a death of the dark value of death.
[01:08:38] SPEAKER_01: And Linda Rottenberg, the founder of Endeavor,
[01:08:40] SPEAKER_01: says that it is precisely at your darkest moment
[01:08:42] SPEAKER_01: that you mentor because it's a sign of,
[01:08:46] you have something to give in the darkest moment of the night,
[01:08:49] SPEAKER_01: which is an interesting chapter.
[01:08:50] SPEAKER_01: They hope, hey, hey, like I have friends who are an egg,
[01:08:53] the body system is so valuable
[01:08:56] SPEAKER_01: because even at your darkest moment,
[01:08:57] SPEAKER_01: you have enough light to help someone.
[01:09:00] And that gives you the strength to make it through.
[01:09:02] So I huge believe very mentoring,
[01:09:04] SPEAKER_01: that's something I will do for my life.
[01:09:06] SPEAKER_01: And then I, the unfinished business,
[01:09:09] SPEAKER_01: I think as I get older,
[01:09:11] SPEAKER_01: I want to help in higher education in the US.
[01:09:15] SPEAKER_01: I think we've lost our way.
[01:09:17] And I saw the impact, scholarship to Harvard,
[01:09:20] SPEAKER_01: to a kid from Bolivia.
[01:09:22] SPEAKER_01: And I love that institution, I love education.
[01:09:26] SPEAKER_01: And I think it's in a moment that it's lost its way
[01:09:30] SPEAKER_01: and we can find it back.
[01:09:33] Can you teach me mentoring?
[01:09:35] SPEAKER_00: How does one mentor well?
[01:09:36] SPEAKER_00: My strategy, there's many ways to do it.
[01:09:40] I don't have time to be someone's mentor for six years
[01:09:45] SPEAKER_01: or to see them maybe as part of Endeavor, I'll see them twice.
[01:09:48] SPEAKER_01: So I have to hurt them.
[01:09:53] For the mentoring to be impactful,
[01:09:55] I have to make it so obvious that it's so stupid
[01:09:58] SPEAKER_01: that they haven't yet focused on this,
[01:10:01] SPEAKER_01: that they're like, I'll show him.
[01:10:03] And then they have to.
[01:10:06] SPEAKER_01: So my mentoring sessions are very uncomfortable.
[01:10:10] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I do it in with a smile on my face.
[01:10:12] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, of course.
[01:10:13] SPEAKER_01: But it works.
[01:10:15] SPEAKER_01: It's like crash therapy, like three years of therapy one hour.
[01:10:19] SPEAKER_01: You got no time for both.
[01:10:21] SPEAKER_01: We're going directly for the sensitive points.
[01:10:24] SPEAKER_01: And I've learned to do it in a way that's not damaging
[01:10:26] SPEAKER_01: or just respectful in any way.
[01:10:28] SPEAKER_01: But it is very scathing.
[01:10:31] SPEAKER_01: I'm saying, you can't, this is clearly an opportunity.
[01:10:34] SPEAKER_01: Come on, wake up, smell the coffee.
[01:10:36] SPEAKER_01: And sure enough, I have a couple billion or friends
[01:10:39] SPEAKER_01: who are like, you really hurt me, but thank you.
[01:10:41] SPEAKER_01: And I'm so curious about like literal process.
[01:10:47] SPEAKER_00: Like if you're meeting someone for the first time,
[01:10:49] SPEAKER_00: it is the format you ask them a bunch of questions
[01:10:51] SPEAKER_00: and then you quickly do the, you know,
[01:10:53] SPEAKER_00: the aggressive like, why aren't you doing this thing?
[01:10:56] So I'm married to a shrink psychoanalyst.
[01:10:58] SPEAKER_01: So as a condition to our marriage, I have to do psychoanalysts.
[01:11:02] SPEAKER_01: And it's a wonderful thing.
[01:11:03] SPEAKER_01: I wrote it.
[01:11:04] SPEAKER_01: It's one of the three things you wrote with therapy and meditation.
[01:11:06] SPEAKER_01: And one of my favorite is now a disease,
[01:11:11] SPEAKER_01: but he was a philosopher, writer, an incredible Italian Brazilian.
[01:11:15] SPEAKER_01: I have very famous in Brazil.
[01:11:17] SPEAKER_01: And you would go to his one hour weekly session
[01:11:22] SPEAKER_01: and you would look at you in silence.
[01:11:24] SPEAKER_01: And if I didn't say anything after a while,
[01:11:25] SPEAKER_01: you just say, in town, in town is translating so,
[01:11:31] SPEAKER_01: I'll let you take it.
[01:11:32] The most powerful way to start a conversation
[01:11:35] SPEAKER_01: with someone you're trying to get to know is silence.
[01:11:38] You tell me.
[01:11:40] What do you want to talk about?
[01:11:41] SPEAKER_01: What do you want to?
[01:11:42] For example, simple.
[01:11:43] SPEAKER_01: I'll give you another one.
[01:11:44] SPEAKER_01: I asked what's the most important question
[01:11:47] SPEAKER_01: you need the answer to from the universe.
[01:11:51] The answer to that question is so powerful.
[01:11:55] Because vocalizing that which you most want the answer to
[01:11:59] SPEAKER_01: is liberating.
[01:12:02] My traditional closing question for everyone is the same.
[01:12:04] SPEAKER_00: What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you?
[01:12:07] Daniela, tell me how to love.
[01:12:11] As we establish, my heart's not very developed.
[01:12:14] SPEAKER_01: My God and my brain are very developed.
[01:12:16] SPEAKER_01: And she's such a loving, wonderful woman.
[01:12:21] And she's been loved by her and learning from her,
[01:12:27] SPEAKER_01: how to love back.
[01:12:28] SPEAKER_01: And then learning from her how to love our daughters
[01:12:31] SPEAKER_01: and the way that they need to be loved.
[01:12:35] SPEAKER_01: And she's so smart.
[01:12:36] SPEAKER_01: And loving me can sometimes be very hard.
[01:12:38] SPEAKER_01: We're a beautiful place to close.
[01:12:44] SPEAKER_00: And thank you for the reminder to laugh a lot
[01:12:46] SPEAKER_00: at these conversations.
[01:12:47] SPEAKER_00: Thanks for your time.
[01:12:48] SPEAKER_00: Thanks for having me.
