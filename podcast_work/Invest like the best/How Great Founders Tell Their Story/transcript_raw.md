[00:00:00] Everything is a narrative, really anything in society is some version of an narrative.
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_00: When the predicate understanding of what is actually happening is made conscious
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_00: and is communicated in a way that doesn't quite name the thing,
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_00: it was able to metaphorically describe it.
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_00: It can be extremely inspiring because it simply seems that these three elements
[00:00:19] SPEAKER_00: of the internal and the philosophical combined unlock something that moves people very deeply.
[00:00:30] I'd love to ask a bunch of questions about work that you've done with companies
[00:00:42] SPEAKER_01: and helping the founders of those companies distill down the narrative of them, their business,
[00:00:50] SPEAKER_01: their product in a way that's transformative for them.
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_01: I know you've done this with startups, you've done this with massive companies.
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_01: We probably can't name. It's a thing you've done over and over again.
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_01: If you describe this thing that you've done with a number of people
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_01: in as much detail, like crazy detail as you're willing to,
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_01: like the method that has started to emerge from this curiosity you have about certain builders
[00:01:16] SPEAKER_01: and what you do with that curiosity and how you help them.
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_01: When you talk to someone about this like self-knowledge exploration or something,
[00:01:23] SPEAKER_01: is the thing or after the underlying reason that they themselves may not know yet why they're
[00:01:28] SPEAKER_01: doing what they're doing? Does it boil down to that?
[00:01:31] SPEAKER_01: The way I think of it is the story works in three layers. One, there's the external mechanics
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_00: of how the character interacts in the world and you can substitute character for product.
[00:01:41] SPEAKER_00: That's a requirement and in the case of technology, it's technical. You've got to have something
[00:01:46] SPEAKER_00: that people works. There's no way around that. Then there are two more layers, which is a subjective
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_00: layer of why is this series of events important to me and what does it mean to me personally?
[00:02:02] Then there is a philosophical layer. On a philosophical level, it's probably where you try to find out
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_00: and you have to steal madness and it's very easy to straw-man it, but you've got to steal
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_00: man it. How you believe the world works today and what people believe makes a good world?
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_00: Because everyone, most of the time, believes they're doing what is the right thing and what
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_00: it needs to be done the way it's done for a reason. They're mostly not wrong. There's almost
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_00: intractable philosophical beliefs of how the world works and why that's a good thing.
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_00: You're juxtaposed that with your own personal philosophy of the dominant role of you is actually wrong.
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_00: You just plant that with your own personal philosophy. Ideally, you do this, you know,
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_00: it's four or five points and you do it on a direct refutational basis. So each one, you say,
[00:02:59] SPEAKER_00: everyone believes this, I believe that. When this is steal man, it's really helpful.
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_00: And then you do the same, so this is on a sort of global level about how the world and when we talk
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_00: about world, it's probably specific to whatever it is you're building or running.
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_00: And then they do that for the personal as well. So you can do it for a customer, you can do it
[00:03:22] SPEAKER_00: for a person you're selling to. How do they believe things should be done? And you're juxtaposed
[00:03:27] SPEAKER_00: that with what you think should be done. I want to just like drill on these three layers of the story.
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_01: And try to turn it into a device that someone could like take away from this and try to apply to
[00:03:39] SPEAKER_01: themselves. If I'm listening and I'm curious about, I'll just keep it grounded in business,
[00:03:44] SPEAKER_01: like the story of my business at these three levels. Is there a good question that I could ask
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_01: like prompt myself with to get at external, the emotional and the philosophical? Can you think of
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_01: a question, one question for each? The external would be what are we doing? What are we making? What
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_00: are we selling? What are we buying? Whatever it may be. As a core function of the company,
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_00: the philosophical is the why on a more abstract level. So you believe in certain ideals or certain
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_00: way you believe the world should be on an abstract level. The emotional is a personal why.
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_00: In the foundest case, it's very often why they are doing it. So there is an origin story
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_00: around that. They will recruit people consciously or unconsciously that is in the similar vein.
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_00: And you can get very theoretical about this if you want to. I think for the majority of people,
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_00: it's a visual personal experience that other people can relate to if it's a larger organization.
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_00: Why one does this on a personal level? And it's these three things working in concert,
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_00: picking up by the other leaves off and sort of having a trifecta dance.
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_00: So it's a maybe to rebuild it in the other direction. The questions are something like, how should the
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_01: world be in a general sense? How do we believe? How do I believe makes a good world in the good life?
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_01: The second layer is, why am I doing this? What is it about my specific story that maps back onto
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_01: that? And the third is, what are we doing about it? And if you tell the company's story in that
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_01: way, what does it galvanize that makes it worth pursuing in the first place? Because it seems like
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_01: the thing that I encounter over and over again is even companies making something really great.
[00:05:22] SPEAKER_01: Don't know how to talk about themselves for whatever reason. I'm curious why you think that is,
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_01: like, why companies struggle with that? And then why there's such a payoff to doing the work to
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_01: figure it out? I think sometimes it's because doing the thing is so difficult and complex.
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_00: That the idea of having to frame this now on top of everything else in some sort of philosophical
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_00: way is overwhelming and doesn't even seem necessary at times. Of course, it's always present and
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_00: people just are not conscious of it. I think that's very often the case that it's all there. It just
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_00: hasn't been on the earth yet, which is great fun because the second you give people these tools,
[00:06:02] SPEAKER_00: they're just frameworks to live within. They're decision-making frameworks. Everything is in
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_00: the narrative. Really anything in society is some version of a narrative. When this is made
[00:06:15] conscious, so when the predicate understanding of what is actually happening is made conscious
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_00: and is communicated in a way that doesn't quite name the thing but has been able to metaphorically
[00:06:26] SPEAKER_00: describe it. It can be extremely inspiring because it simply seems that these three elements
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_00: of the internal and the philosophical combined unlock something that moves people very deeply.
[00:06:40] I was at Stanford when the turnaround for Apple sort of in its second inning, I should not be using
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_00: baseball metaphors because I have no idea what they are but so it was, but this was a man who had
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_00: a philosophy of sort of a personal wrong view and knew exactly what he was fighting against
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_00: at all times and then acted accordingly with unbelievable discipline and courage and created
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_00: something that was at work of art in many ways. He literally wanted to make business art and he
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_00: kind of did every one of these instances is completely unique obviously. But I think that is
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_00: what's possible. It also makes it just more interesting in general. It's very easy to be
[00:07:25] SPEAKER_00: conformist in some sense because you know what's expected but there's a lot left on the table too.
[00:07:31] At the same time espousing a new narrative or finding a predicate understanding,
[00:07:37] just unlocks a ton. It doesn't need to be this life changing. Sometimes it can be
[00:07:42] SPEAKER_00: cremental and just unlock a whole new world of potential that is very easily implemented.
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_00: In many ways stories are very good at creating symbols which represent some sort of transcendental
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_00: belief that people participate in. In the sense that everyone has an ultimate concern, something
[00:08:00] SPEAKER_00: that they're in absolute ways concerned about. We'll talk about it but it can be many different
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_00: kinds of things. It can be money, it can be a deity, it can be truth. To be able to
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_00: present an ultimate concern around a business organization that makes a product of some kind.
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_00: I think fulfills personal life picture for the people here communicating it to.
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_00: So it just feels more important, it feels true and it feels more meaningful and worthwhile.
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_00: We're going to talk a lot about applying some of these principles to the world of building companies
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_01: or making things. One of the very first things I can remember you teaching me is something to the
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_01: effect of everyone's focus is on the new when trying to tell you have their thing. But that the
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_01: right approach is actually like maybe only 20% new and 80% familiar or something like that.
[00:08:57] SPEAKER_01: Can you say more about this principle of storytelling or of delivering a message or
[00:09:02] SPEAKER_01: conveying something to people that the track we fall in of just trying to just focus on the exciting
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_01: new thing? The interesting thing about this whole world is that there are no rules to it.
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_00: Everyone cleans and tries to come up with rules for themselves. That sometimes that seem to work
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_00: more often than they don't work but there's no book on this really. Remind though with the
[00:09:25] SPEAKER_00: designer had a similar rule right around 80-20. The most tolerable element of new
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_00: before it's rejected by the human mind is incomprehensible. With the idea of originality and
[00:09:38] SPEAKER_00: creativity there's a sort of tension even of itself is a story. There's this tension where especially
[00:09:47] SPEAKER_00: now originality is highly prized and there's sort of this belief that only the very new is truly
[00:09:55] SPEAKER_00: novel with storytelling especially but I even think maybe this is confirmation bias but I even
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_00: think in business or in innovation. The new is really just the obvious uncovered through systematic
[00:10:10] SPEAKER_00: trial and ever over a certain period of time so that by striving to stay within the obvious
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_00: and trying to find a variation on the obvious I think you have a higher chance at least in
[00:10:20] SPEAKER_00: storytelling of discovering something novel that will still feel intelligible enough to categorize
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_00: in the world. Some people have an ability to see something truly new and immediately categorize it
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_00: and those people tend to be very successful investors for instance but generally speaking I think the
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_00: the idea of original is overrated and that great filmmakers know this for instance I get great
[00:10:45] SPEAKER_00: novelists know this that you can begin with something very familiar and make it feel totally new
[00:10:53] SPEAKER_00: incrementally. Tell me about the the short film that you like so much that's nothing more than a
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_01: camera painting back and forth. It was a project where simply there's a camera installed in the room
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_00: and the camera would move back and forth across the room and each time uncover a little bit more
[00:11:11] SPEAKER_00: of the room and nothing else happens there's no payoff to it but the suspense of seeing a little bit
[00:11:19] SPEAKER_00: more information about the room is absolutely ribiting even just this tiny amount of new information
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_00: being given creates enormous suspense because somehow we're good at anticipating we're really always
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_00: anticipating each new piece of information gets put into some kind of puzzle so by the end the suspense
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_00: is unbearable. If you think about the power of communicating by starting with the familiar in the known
[00:11:41] SPEAKER_01: how would you encourage CEOs companies people talking about their thing
[00:11:46] SPEAKER_01: use that truth like what is the method that you've seen the best explain accepted reality before
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_01: trying to explain their new thing like is there a method that comes out of this that you think is
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_01: useful to founders especially is the group that I'm the most interested in. I think the reason
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_00: storytelling to me is so effective is because you have a subjective point of view that an individual
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_00: can relate to because it's sort of imitating and processing the characters point of view so it's
[00:12:20] SPEAKER_00: subjective in that way. Subjective access to storytelling it would be universal truth but that
[00:12:27] SPEAKER_00: can be only accessed subjectively. Does that mean that in trying to reach the mind of a customer let's
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_01: say the right thing or allocation of time for the founder is to spend most of their time understanding
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_01: the natural story of the customer as it currently exists versus how it should be and then build
[00:12:44] SPEAKER_01: off of that. I think that's exactly right. It's easy to forget that you're dealing with human
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_00: beings right to have a human experience at the same time as having a professional experience
[00:12:54] SPEAKER_00: and story is really good at seeing these two layers at the same time there's a subjective experience
[00:12:59] SPEAKER_00: that a human being has and then there's the professional experience on top of it and I think
[00:13:03] SPEAKER_00: you want to combine these two and understand your dealing with human beings first and foremost
[00:13:08] SPEAKER_00: and I think the greatest founders and the greatest builders understand this instinctively. What did
[00:13:13] SPEAKER_00: you learn running studios? You've been a part of making so many things, so many movies. Yeah,
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_01: always around this sort of mid-sized places. I never ran a certain, I've wondered by this type of
[00:13:23] SPEAKER_00: place simply because I don't make the kinds of movies particularly good at or interesting
[00:13:29] SPEAKER_00: interested in at the same time I, it's a very specific skill set to run the big ones. So I
[00:13:34] SPEAKER_00: ran the mid-sized ones. I think it has to do with being able to communicate in different worlds
[00:13:39] SPEAKER_00: which is actually quite difficult because you have to speak the language of filmmakers who live
[00:13:42] SPEAKER_00: in their own, in their own world and then you have to speak the language of corporate
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_00: because they're reporting requirements and business requirements and then you have to speak the
[00:13:54] SPEAKER_00: language of marketing and sales. You are a communicator between worlds and your job is to understand
[00:14:02] SPEAKER_00: the language of filmmaking and the language of business and the language of marketing
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_00: and run interference so the thing can happen. What could CEOs learn from filmmakers or two groups
[00:14:14] SPEAKER_01: that like lead a group of people to make a thing? I've always been this weird obsession with
[00:14:19] SPEAKER_01: filmmakers out on the wide. Maybe it's the fact that the thing they make like hasn't, it ends,
[00:14:24] SPEAKER_01: like the project ends and then it's on to the next. It's not just this like continuous thing that
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_01: you have to constantly build and that's appealing to me in some way. You've worked with some of the
[00:14:32] SPEAKER_01: amazing filmmakers and appreciated their art. What could one learn from the other?
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_01: I come back to this ability and willingness to take ultimate responsibility,
[00:14:46] which is really not what most people want to do at all. For some reason, especially filmmakers,
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_00: I have a true vision of what it is they want to be doing which means they
[00:14:55] are the birthing, right? This project and they take ultimate responsibility from the beginning to end
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_00: and then do it again and then do it again. Each time risking, you know, total failure,
[00:15:09] SPEAKER_00: staking their entire being on this one next thing. They're running these pretty big temporary startups
[00:15:19] that get funding from the outside world, like they get distribution from somewhere else,
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_00: not themselves. So I think it's the courage and it's also the courage to espouse their particular
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_00: worldview and all the great filmmakers have a very particular worldview. I think it's extraordinary
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_00: that this exists at all in the world. Someone like that exists who will do that even if it fails.
[00:15:44] And then it's willing to do it again. Some of the CEOs I've gotten to know are there also artists
[00:15:48] SPEAKER_00: in some ways, right? Because this is difficult stuff. Especially when you have 100,000 employees,
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_00: I mean, and you're owning it too. To answer the question more precisely, I think it's this
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_00: the willingness and the courage to espouse a specific kind of worldview that perhaps is a little bit
[00:16:04] SPEAKER_00: counter, but stands in some tension to the dominoan worldview and own that anyways.
[00:16:09] SPEAKER_00: Having been and worked with lots of CEOs that have chosen this like ultimate responsibility,
[00:16:15] how would you articulate the job of a CEO? Like in your experience when you've seen people do that
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_01: job well or do it poorly, what are the good ones and some like basic sense doing really well?
[00:16:26] SPEAKER_01: Society is communication and that because of its complexity, communication breaks down into
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_00: buckets of specialty, but it's in essence being a master communicator of almost infinite amount
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_00: of buckets and knowing the context which between them and understanding the language games at each
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_00: one of these buckets plays, but never forgetting the core principles underneath all this. Some of it
[00:16:49] SPEAKER_00: is unspoken. The people I've observed, especially as one person that I admire enormously, he's
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_00: doing a massive turnaround and he has been communicating the same marching orders for two years to
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_00: this huge company and everyone around him was in doubt. And the results are finally coming in
[00:17:06] SPEAKER_00: and he's right and he's sort of imposed his will against all these obstacles, but he was able to
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_00: do it because he could communicate exactly what he was doing almost in these three layers to anyone
[00:17:19] SPEAKER_00: but always adjusting, never the philosophy but always sort of adjusting the emotional component
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_00: to whomever he was speaking to so that each person could hear the point that needed to be
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_00: conveyed so they could be a piece knowing that they're done their bit for this thing to work out
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_00: and to be able to communicate that in such a way that the people you're speaking to can hear it.
[00:17:42] Because you're adjusting this emotional subjective emotional component to them, that to me is
[00:17:48] SPEAKER_00: the secret of great communication. What is an iconic character to you? And I ask that because
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_01: I feel like most people maybe selfishly want themselves to be like an iconic character in their
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_01: own story, their company to be an iconic thing in the world that it operates. You see what
[00:18:03] SPEAKER_01: iconic characters, what are the things come to mind? My view today and my change, but has probably to
[00:18:10] SPEAKER_00: do with an ability to be a Greek hero, which means to live and espouse a world view that is
[00:18:16] SPEAKER_00: universally disliked. That's iconic. I'm really interested on this pure narrative level in what
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_00: Elon Musk is doing because it is so unconcerned with the traditional hero trajectory. He's almost
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_00: Greek in this idea of the breaking societal rules, if you will, that you get to some
[00:18:40] platonic ideal, that is worth more than acceptance. And I think all stories have in common the idea
[00:18:48] SPEAKER_00: of resilience, that the character will overcome these obstacles and things are not working. And
[00:18:54] SPEAKER_00: there's enough knowledge and enough power to go where one must go, where one has impelled,
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_00: or has been impelled to go, and keep going anyways. So this idea of resilience and to keep going
[00:19:06] SPEAKER_00: anyways, even though the obstacles are getting enormous, I think inspires that begrudging admiration.
[00:19:13] None of this is a moral evaluation. In no one case, when I think what's good or bad on a
[00:19:17] SPEAKER_00: sort of personal moral level, but on a narrative level, I think it's absolutely fascinating that
[00:19:22] SPEAKER_00: you have someone willing to step out on such limbs all the time. Is that also disfiding death?
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_00: Everything is in some ways a death project. Right? Yeah, absolutely. Who feels that
[00:19:32] SPEAKER_00: creativity, the art of creating, negates death, and therefore is the purest
[00:19:40] SPEAKER_00: expression of a battle against the inevitable. And Tolkien has this famous clip on YouTube that
[00:19:45] SPEAKER_00: is like, all stories are about death. And I think he's absolutely right because it's the ultimate
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_00: stakes. And it's the stakes everyone lives with every day and we get up and do things anyways.
[00:19:54] SPEAKER_00: It's good to be friend that so we all have to die and therefore a certain kind of story is appealing.
[00:19:59] SPEAKER_01: Well, I think it has to do with a perceived power differential, right? Then we're completely
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_00: powerless in the face of death, at least now. And that is a fantasy to acquire more power. And then
[00:20:10] SPEAKER_00: because we have this capacity to imagine the future, and we can imagine really much anything,
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_00: we have an ability to create our own cherished outcome that overcoming this weakness with
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_00: the power fantasy, right? So Robert Towne who was a great screenwriter and
[00:20:30] SPEAKER_00: wrote Trinitown and he recently died. A wonderful life and a wonderful career. He said this to
[00:20:36] SPEAKER_00: me a lunch years ago when I was a young executive. He said, stories are either desires fulfilled or
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_00: anxieties perched. I think he's right. You know, these are great minds who've made great films.
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_00: It's never left me. I think it has to do with overcoming the basic human condition.
[00:20:54] I want you to expand on each of those two anxiety perched or fantasy fulfilled. That these are the two
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_01: fundamental kinds of stories. Is it important that people know which one they're in?
[00:21:04] SPEAKER_01: We experience both desire and fear, right? It's not just one or the other. The hero's journey is
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_00: very often a desire to rise in the world. That's a desire to to fulfill one's potential in the world.
[00:21:16] SPEAKER_00: An anxiety or a fear perched is an idea of an inherent fear of something that might happen to
[00:21:22] SPEAKER_00: you that you really don't wish to happen. It feels good to see a version of the world play out
[00:21:29] SPEAKER_00: where that which you're afraid of actually doesn't happen because you have had agency in defeating
[00:21:35] SPEAKER_00: it. This is always really important. So story is character in action, right? Things don't happen to
[00:21:40] SPEAKER_00: you. It's you act against obstacles. And as you do require knowledge and with knowledge comes
[00:21:50] SPEAKER_00: power to then effect the outcome. It's also interesting to say to see that this is never done alone.
[00:21:59] SPEAKER_00: So they're always surrogates. People who give you knowledge and people who age you in the quest.
[00:22:06] SPEAKER_00: Whatever the quest may be. Because you begin to process for what makes a great story,
[00:22:10] SPEAKER_01: making them, enjoying them. What elements started to fall out? I have an unusual maybe view of this
[00:22:17] SPEAKER_00: because I don't know we think the thing it needs to be enjoyable. I think that's a recent meaning
[00:22:23] SPEAKER_00: in the last 30, 40 years phenomenon where we're storytelling became entertainment almost exclusively.
[00:22:31] SPEAKER_00: And I don't think that's the only degenerology of that space at all. I also think story is
[00:22:37] SPEAKER_00: as a religious aspect. Not in the organized way necessarily, but perhaps in a way of ultimate concern.
[00:22:46] SPEAKER_00: Maybe the most common ultimate concern probably by revealed preference in the US and the people
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_01: listening to this as money. What do you think about that? It's an unbelievably powerful symbol
[00:22:57] SPEAKER_00: because it has its source potentiality. So the mind can imagine anything. So it's the ultimate story
[00:23:03] SPEAKER_00: in some sense outside of the greatest story ever told where both all your desires and fantasies
[00:23:08] SPEAKER_00: can be fulfilled and all your anxieties can be patched. To such a degree maybe that the money project
[00:23:13] SPEAKER_00: is a denial of death project. The more you accrue of that because it allows itself to be imprinted
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_00: with any vision that you want. The more you accrue of it, the more it gives the illusion that
[00:23:29] SPEAKER_00: you're not going to have to leave your consciousness. What is a great story to you? What does that mean?
[00:23:35] I think it's a character starting at an extreme point going to an extreme point that they
[00:23:40] SPEAKER_00: cannot imagine at the beginning, but consciously imagine at the beginning but somehow deep down
[00:23:44] SPEAKER_00: know that this is where they need to go. And then situations arranged in such a way that the original
[00:23:51] SPEAKER_00: intent faces bigger and bigger versions of a barrier that is then resolved at the very end to
[00:23:58] SPEAKER_00: some degree. Most characters that you meet are either underdogs trying to rise or kings or
[00:24:04] SPEAKER_00: falling or queens are falling. The biggest people in the world believe they're the underdog.
[00:24:09] SPEAKER_00: Right? Because we are again locked into this subjective experience of the world and we are
[00:24:15] SPEAKER_00: wanting beings. Why is that such an appealing story? Like, why is the underdog that
[00:24:21] SPEAKER_01: succeeds so universally enjoyable? Because everyone views themselves as one.
[00:24:27] SPEAKER_00: Right? So you get access to people when they recognize themselves in what it is you're saying.
[00:24:37] SPEAKER_00: The human desire to overcome our wretched state, which is this Kikigat phrase I always love.
[00:24:47] SPEAKER_00: It's humans are gods who shit. I think it has to do with this capable
[00:24:58] SPEAKER_00: being on this planet that has to die. Right? So, and that sends all these things to questions of death.
[00:25:04] SPEAKER_00: Let me evaluate my distillation of great story and ask you what's missing in the elements that
[00:25:12] SPEAKER_01: as I've thought, I know you were coming to see me. So I was thinking about this a lot.
[00:25:17] SPEAKER_01: And I was trying to give myself only three common traits or something just to keep it simple.
[00:25:23] And the things I came up with were originality, which we talked a little bit about in terms of
[00:25:28] SPEAKER_01: dominant worldview versus how you think the world should be hardship and ultimately transformation.
[00:25:34] SPEAKER_01: As I think about my favorite stories or if I think about the own best versions of my story that
[00:25:40] SPEAKER_01: I've lived because I know it intimately, those three elements have been present and or dominant
[00:25:47] in what I view as great stories. Where do you agree and disagree with those elements? I'm curious.
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_01: Hachib, as the barrier to be overcome is the foundational element of an narrative.
[00:26:03] SPEAKER_00: I find it very interesting in general that when you look at the history of storytelling,
[00:26:09] SPEAKER_00: how the archetype or the paradigm of what a story is is someone
[00:26:16] SPEAKER_00: actively overcoming obstacles to achieve something. So I guess somehow this must correspond to
[00:26:26] how collectively, when you see this in Chinese mythology, you see an Indian mythology,
[00:26:33] SPEAKER_00: you overcome through activity, through intentional action.
[00:26:41] SPEAKER_00: A big or small doesn't mean that these can just be very, very small.
[00:26:45] SPEAKER_00: I mean, my Bergman is full of interiority. There's almost no external action.
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_00: So most of these, by the way, are internal barriers as well as external barriers.
[00:26:54] So I think that's probably the as a foundational piece, the overcoming of obstacles.
[00:27:02] SPEAKER_00: The which then becomes in and of itself the reason for doing it. There is no journey to go on
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_00: without an obstacle. So in that sense, I think it's essential.
[00:27:13] SPEAKER_00: Originality, I have this specific view in, because I think very often successful people
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_00: will, I just heard an interview with the brilliant designer and he talked about
[00:27:27] SPEAKER_00: originality and how it's so important. And it felt like a status game that people play,
[00:27:32] SPEAKER_00: that when they do something great, that somehow it was entirely original, so as to
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_00: the grandize their achievement. And it's entirely possible that they felt that this was the case.
[00:27:45] SPEAKER_00: I think very often it's much more derivative and I think we should be much kinder to
[00:27:50] SPEAKER_00: the notion of derivative. And I think we should understand perhaps that originality is just
[00:27:58] SPEAKER_00: another form of derivation, except it's one that perhaps hasn't been done quite in this way before.
[00:28:04] SPEAKER_00: Everything's been set. Everything we've just said on this conversation.
[00:28:08] SPEAKER_00: In this conversation, it's been set before in some way, by someone at some point.
[00:28:12] It just wasn't maybe heard or it wasn't said in the right way that one specific person could hear it.
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_00: I think originality is in the same way. Maybe to redefine originality then,
[00:28:24] maybe originality is the wrong word and instead it's like a novel revelation of some constant truth
[00:28:29] SPEAKER_01: or something like that, like a new way to show people an old thing. And so what about transformation?
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_01: The transformation is interesting because in the Greek poetic sense, it would be a transformation.
[00:28:42] SPEAKER_00: The emergence of a new insight, a new power which then creates a new kind of version of yourself
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_00: or of the hero itself. And then lately, I've also added maybe in my mind this idea of
[00:28:58] SPEAKER_00: a transcendental insight as enough. James Joyce was all about this, the joyous thing to Piphany,
[00:29:05] SPEAKER_00: the moment where the character accesses the universal truth, the transcendental truth about the world,
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_00: just for a brief moment. And that's the end of it. So even just the recognition,
[00:29:15] SPEAKER_00: oh, this is how the way things really are. Maybe that's enough too.
[00:29:20] SPEAKER_00: What have you learned about status and the role that status plays in human behavior and
[00:29:26] SPEAKER_01: yet just more broadly? I know this is a topic that you've thought a lot about,
[00:29:30] SPEAKER_01: to just about status a bit. I think everything is about status and every scene is about status.
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_00: And every scene is about a power differential. It's what we find relentlessly fascinating.
[00:29:42] SPEAKER_00: Every interaction is about status. There's a story about British actor who knew absolutely everyone
[00:29:50] SPEAKER_00: in English society and for some reason was unsuccessful at getting what they wanted. And he said,
[00:29:54] SPEAKER_00: when he overplayed his status, he would be hated. When he underplayed his status, he wouldn't get
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_00: what he wanted. Everyone liked him, but he wouldn't get what he wanted. When he matched,
[00:30:06] SPEAKER_00: stages, he would get whatever he asked for. How do you define it? What is it? It's a sense of accepted
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_00: superiority vis-a-vis another, whether it's physical, societal or moral. What about just on the
[00:30:23] SPEAKER_01: unlike the very basic level of like thing you're doing and why? I'm building a film studio from scratch
[00:30:30] SPEAKER_00: with Mitchell Aske as Mitchell Mn and A16Z as my investor, including Mitchell. Mitchell Aske is a
[00:30:38] SPEAKER_00: film apartment in Benchmark and comes from the video game world and Mark and Dreson is obviously
[00:30:44] SPEAKER_00: a great lover of cinema and have seen absolutely everything. The quest is twofold trying to make
[00:30:50] movies in a very traditional sense that at least for me personally have an aspiration towards some
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_00: kind of epiphany or some kind of transcendental insight even if it's very brief. Or maybe
[00:30:59] SPEAKER_00: shows some kind of transformation possible around these philosophical principles. And then there are
[00:31:03] SPEAKER_00: two sort of technical components to it. One being is how we make things. And again, I very much
[00:31:10] SPEAKER_00: believe that the nature of artistic expression is in the human intent, but technology can help
[00:31:17] SPEAKER_00: in filmmaking is inherently a technological endeavor because you're representing the world.
[00:31:22] SPEAKER_00: The cameras, right? It's not your staging events to make them look as if they were real, but
[00:31:29] SPEAKER_00: they're obviously not. So in that sense, technologically mediated and always has been.
[00:31:33] SPEAKER_00: And then the third endeavor is going to be around distribution, but marginally. And we're all
[00:31:39] SPEAKER_00: three very interested in whether something can be done on the edges that just houses this 80-20
[00:31:45] SPEAKER_00: philosophy of it's going to be very much a movie company. It is a very much a movie company.
[00:31:50] SPEAKER_00: But maybe has a couple of points in the dominant world view that it perhaps doesn't quite believe
[00:31:57] SPEAKER_00: and wants to substitute something else for it. What have you learned from each of those guys,
[00:32:01] SPEAKER_01: both very talented? And absolutely endless. Both founders, they're both amazingly successful investors,
[00:32:07] SPEAKER_00: they've done the whole thing. They've done it numerous times. And they're very patient and
[00:32:12] SPEAKER_00: generous of these at this stage of the game. They both have a real understanding and passion
[00:32:20] SPEAKER_00: for the craft and the artistic nature of storytelling. Courage, complete comfort with calculated
[00:32:30] SPEAKER_00: failure. As in, if you know what you're doing, you're trying something and you know it's a trial
[00:32:34] SPEAKER_00: balloon, it's totally alright if it goes wrong. As long as you really thought about it. And
[00:32:40] there's a calculated risk as opposed to a random, let's see what sticks kind of risk. Really
[00:32:44] SPEAKER_00: credible ability to map out sort of in an imaginary way what could be always allowing that you're
[00:32:51] SPEAKER_00: not seeing something but really mapping it out. Never sort of in a sense where it's this or that,
[00:32:57] SPEAKER_00: it's always, it could be all these kinds of things. And based on past experience, this has really
[00:33:01] SPEAKER_00: worked. And then sort of branching off of that. Most, I think risk tolerance, I guess maybe it's
[00:33:07] SPEAKER_00: a blessing of success, right? That you just increasingly become tolerant, like a set of calculated risk.
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_00: Which in the creative endeavor is a requirement because you're going to fail.
[00:33:18] SPEAKER_00: Do you think we'd take enough risk in general as people?
[00:33:22] No, no. Not on the personal emotional level, not on the professional level. Even just being
[00:33:30] around people who have a more benevolent attitude towards failure can be extremely helpful.
[00:33:38] SPEAKER_00: Because one's own worth is not caught up in when something works or not.
[00:33:44] SPEAKER_00: Right, this is also a huge advantage that the Americans have in both the Europeans.
[00:33:49] SPEAKER_00: Where it's a failure in Europe is so shameful. I have tons of reasons for ideas for why this might
[00:33:54] SPEAKER_00: be. And then America is more forgiving. Obviously on the margins than sometimes you think,
[00:33:58] SPEAKER_00: oh, wow, this is a level of heatlessness that perhaps is a little irresponsible. But yeah, I think
[00:34:04] SPEAKER_00: risk goes is inherent, sort of the end stage of this kind of transformation that you talk about,
[00:34:10] SPEAKER_00: right, when you have figured out your ultimate concern, you figured out that they're going to be
[00:34:15] SPEAKER_00: barriers. You can kind of name the barriers even. You gain self knowledge, you realize that through
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_00: action, there's power, even just in the action itself, even though it doesn't actually yield anything
[00:34:26] SPEAKER_00: immediately. And then action begins action, which begins courage. I'd love to sort of redo and
[00:34:32] SPEAKER_01: exercise that you've done on me before because I think it's translatable for everyone listening.
[00:34:38] SPEAKER_01: You asked me some question, which was something something that rhymed with,
[00:34:43] SPEAKER_01: what is the what is the version of your story that is so big that it terrifies you?
[00:34:50] SPEAKER_01: Can you impact that very powerful question? The mind obviously is very good at projecting
[00:34:56] SPEAKER_00: into the future and can imagine really, really anything. What is possible,
[00:35:01] SPEAKER_00: even emanating from our own subconscious is so much bigger than what the left-hand is fear of
[00:35:09] SPEAKER_00: brain, the rational, and a little bit called brain can handle. So I think there is a fear of
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_00: the of the business of the world. And that fear of the business of the world is also reflected in
[00:35:25] SPEAKER_00: the inner world. So much of story is actually an inner transformation. So when you have infinite
[00:35:33] SPEAKER_00: potential in the outer world, this potential is probably also inside of you and it's overwhelming.
[00:35:39] SPEAKER_00: So fear is present, but it's a fear of potential of all that could be.
[00:35:45] SPEAKER_00: Do you think fearing greatness is like the ultimate fear?
[00:35:48] SPEAKER_01: I think fearing greatness, as long as we define greatness as a manifold flourishing of
[00:35:55] SPEAKER_00: of life in all its forms, not just a great engineer or a great company builder.
[00:36:01] SPEAKER_00: If we believe, as I do, that storytelling, especially for the course of from Gilgamesh
[00:36:07] SPEAKER_00: all the way to now, is thousands of years of storytelling and myth making, that we have thoroughly
[00:36:13] SPEAKER_00: enjoyed people realizing potential in the world, that there is an inner drive to reach one's
[00:36:21] SPEAKER_00: potential. There's probably a fear of reaching one's own potential because it might be too big.
[00:36:30] SPEAKER_00: What about inner conflicts, like a character who wants to opposing things?
[00:36:37] SPEAKER_01: Well, that's the definition of story. So this is a Faulkner quote, but great
[00:36:43] SPEAKER_00: conflict is the heart and conflict with itself. That's a great story. So you want to conflict
[00:36:48] SPEAKER_00: things at the same time. You're afraid and you're very invested in your fear and you want,
[00:36:56] SPEAKER_00: you create situations in the original state where you
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_00: this investment in your fear pays off and at the same time there's a part of you's most
[00:37:05] SPEAKER_00: of subconscious can be conscious, that there's a dream of greatness, if you will.
[00:37:10] SPEAKER_00: And those are absolutely in conflict because the fear wants to dominate and the greatness wants to
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_00: come out and do its thing and it's through the story itself that this gets worked out.
[00:37:22] SPEAKER_00: And I always think this, when someone takes on the position of a leader and how relieved
[00:37:29] SPEAKER_00: everyone else is not to have to do that, people love to just disappear and amass
[00:37:34] SPEAKER_00: and be relieved of the burden of individuality. But this is possible because someone has a
[00:37:40] SPEAKER_00: will to power and steps up and says, I want to do it. Why do you think that is should more people
[00:37:44] SPEAKER_01: want? Should we all be leaders in some way? In some way, I think emphasis in some way. I think
[00:37:50] SPEAKER_00: we have a very narrow definition of leaders, business of political leader and then that's sort of
[00:37:54] SPEAKER_00: the end of it. I think actually if you invert that and you just simply say, you have a pretty good
[00:37:59] SPEAKER_00: understanding of yourself at that point in time based on reflection and you act according to
[00:38:05] SPEAKER_00: this pretty good understanding, as best as you can at that point in time, you are already a leader,
[00:38:10] SPEAKER_00: right? Simply because you're guided by a philosophical worldview that feels absolutely true to you
[00:38:20] SPEAKER_00: at that moment. Back to this exercise of a version of a story that's so big it terrifies you.
[00:38:26] It sounds like the model is, the just raw potential is so big but the mind can't figure it out.
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_01: And so the process is figuring out how to get something that's subconscious out, like let it free.
[00:38:39] SPEAKER_01: How does one do that? Character in action. Through action. This is the great discovery of the
[00:38:46] SPEAKER_00: pragmatist, which I think is a huge reason for why the American experiment has been so successful
[00:38:52] SPEAKER_00: is that people do a lot of doing happening. You cannot have a good narrative without an active
[00:38:57] SPEAKER_00: character. There's no one that sits around and thinks they're waithful problems. I think it's a
[00:39:02] SPEAKER_00: combination of having a dominant worldview to fight against, of having a personal worldview
[00:39:09] SPEAKER_00: to his spouse, all of which can change. Probably won't change all that much, but he can.
[00:39:18] And a willingness to those voices that perhaps are in the subconscious safely come to the surface
[00:39:26] SPEAKER_00: and see where it goes without having an out-especific outcome in mind. Narrative's
[00:39:31] SPEAKER_00: fear made conscious and conquer through action. If I go back to the beginning and take everything
[00:39:37] SPEAKER_01: we've talked about and ask you again to give a sort of like grand unified theory of everything
[00:39:43] SPEAKER_01: that you've been searching for, what's your best attempt at that? It's a technology that is able to
[00:39:51] through resilience, through pulling from all strands of knowledge to communicate
[00:39:57] SPEAKER_00: and ultimate concern, so an absolute truth in the story universe. In such a subjective way,
[00:40:06] SPEAKER_00: in such a way that the individual can understand it on an emotional personal level, which is kind of
[00:40:11] SPEAKER_00: also what philosophy has been trying to do, and it's also what religion has been trying to do.
[00:40:17] So in that sense, it's a technology layer of arranging situations and character in such a way
[00:40:25] that enables this transmission. Storytelling is still theoretical and has a form of salvation,
[00:40:32] SPEAKER_00: not the form of salvation, a form of salvation. Maybe the answers to the question,
[00:40:36] SPEAKER_00: I'm aware they have love, the answer is yes. It very often comes back to that on the emotional level.
[00:40:43] SPEAKER_00: And then very often you're safe to die and the answer is in most cases yes.
[00:40:47] SPEAKER_00: Why is the answer both? Yes? It's better than the alternative.
[00:40:50] SPEAKER_00: You mentioned, I can't even don't, Rosenthal to me one time. Yes. What did he teach you and how did he teach you too?
[00:41:00] SPEAKER_01: That it's safe to die and that you're worthy of love.
[00:41:06] SPEAKER_00: By saying that in the end, every story is a metaphor, right? So you want to couch all
[00:41:12] SPEAKER_00: all these absolute truths revealed in a subjective way in metaphors that don't spell it out directly,
[00:41:19] SPEAKER_00: but convey their meaning through something that's close but not the thing itself.
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_00: And he had this wonderful way of repeating back to you the absurdity of your beliefs and laughing at them.
[00:41:35] SPEAKER_00: So you would be laughing at these absurd constructs that these stories that you've come up with
[00:41:40] SPEAKER_00: and believe to be fundamentally true, mainly because you hadn't done the work of just saying,
[00:41:45] SPEAKER_00: well, what do you really believe? And once you want to do that, it's your ultimate concern and
[00:41:53] SPEAKER_00: it's your bedrock and you can refer back to that at any given time. Usually every five minutes,
[00:42:00] SPEAKER_00: when you have to communicate and make a decision of some kind, it gives you enormous confidence.
[00:42:04] SPEAKER_00: There's another guy that I really like this guy, John McDonald, who talks to Lord about Mr. Eckhart,
[00:42:09] SPEAKER_00: the German mystic, who was on the edge of Christianity because it was really almost
[00:42:15] SPEAKER_00: emerging into Buddhism, who had this concept of Gillesenhyde, which is the Latin go of all intent,
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_00: simply experience a divine nature that's already in you by the pure fact that you're alive.
[00:42:29] SPEAKER_00: And once you realize that all else is enough to thought. And I think that's probably what Don
[00:42:35] SPEAKER_00: Rosenfell communicated to me in a visceral way. I'm going to ask my traditional closing question.
[00:42:40] SPEAKER_01: What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you? I thought about this.
[00:42:46] There's so many people that I owe a lot to. I know that it's my wife, who married me.
[00:42:56] I think that probably is the kind of thing. Simple as that. Wolfgang, I've counted on you for so many
[00:43:02] SPEAKER_01: episodes of trying to figure things out. And you've pointed out several times today that
[00:43:09] each version of this exercise is deeply personal and you can't abstract it into some perfect formula
[00:43:14] SPEAKER_01: to have everyone find their way. But I hope we've done a decent job of some breadcrumbs that people
[00:43:21] SPEAKER_01: can follow in pursuit of their own kind of most interesting version of their story. Thank you so
[00:43:26] SPEAKER_01: much for doing this with me. Thank you. Thank you.
