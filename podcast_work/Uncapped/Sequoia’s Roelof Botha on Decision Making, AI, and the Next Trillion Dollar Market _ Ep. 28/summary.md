# [Investment Memo: Roelof Botha (Sequoia Capital) - Uncapped Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8njhsYUNNk)

## 1. Key Themes

### Theme 1: Venture Capital is NOT an Asset Class - Mathematical Impossibility of Current Returns

Roelof presents a compelling mathematical argument that venture capital cannot support current capital inflows. He breaks down the arithmetic: "$250 billion is going in every single year. If you assume that the firms generate 12% IRR's net, native fees and carry...You'd need a 3.7X on a 7-year exit horizon...That approximates to a trillion dollars a year...That's 1.5 trillion annually in company exit value...you need 30, 40, 50 Figma's every year to make that arithmetic work."

**Substantiation:** "There were basically 20 companies per year on average over the last 20-30 years that they've ended up being worth in realized exits of billion dollars or more. Just 20 companies. Despite a lot more money plowing into venture capital, we haven't seen a material change in the number of companies that are outcomes that are large." - Roelof Botha

The fundamental disconnect: venture doesn't scale with more capital like other asset classes. "If you add more money, you can build more real estate. There's a lot of equities. There are trillions and trillions of bonds to be purchased. Venture capital doesn't scale with more money." - Roelof Botha

### Theme 2: Cost Reduction as Silicon Valley's Secret Weapon

Roelof argues that relentless cost focus is more important than product innovation for enabling ubiquitous technology adoption. "Cost is the secret of Silicon Valley...relentless cost reduction is actually a far bigger ingredient to Silicon Valley success than most people realize."

**Substantiation:** He provides multiple historical examples: "Whether it's the little square reader that turned every mobile phone into a credit card terminal, whether it was the way that SpaceX reduced the cost of travel to space by an order of magnitude or Google's innovation in its data centers." - Roelof Botha

The key insight: "Price is not a competitive advantage. Cost is an advantage. If you have a fundamental cost advantage of a competitor, you might price the same and just end up with high gross margins...it gives you the degrees of freedom to choose how to play the game." - Roelof Botha

### Theme 3: Institutional Paranoia as Cultural Cornerstone

Despite representing 30% of NASDAQ value from their portfolio companies, Sequoia maintains extreme paranoia about future performance. "When you look at the top venture firms in Silicon Valley in 1990, the majority of them no longer exist. There's a long half-life in the venture business, but there's no guarantee that you will succeed long-term."

**Substantiation:** The physical manifestation: "On the wall, wall-to-wall, in each individual's handwriting, we have printed the handwriting that says, we are only as good as our next investment. And so every single day when I go grab a cup of coffee and I look at that wall, I see my own handwriting." - Roelof Botha

The operational reality: "We case so deeply if we lose an investment, we are very diligent about looking at the coverage analysis of what our competitors invested in. And did we have a shot of that investment? Did we miss it? Did we not understand it? Is there a category that's emerging that we're slow to identify? We obsess about that." - Roelof Botha

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### Contrarian View 1: AI Margin Compression is Overblown - Experience Curves Will Dominate

Most investors worry about 40% gross margins in AI application companies. Roelof argues this misunderstands historical cost curves.

**Facts/Experience:** "I remember in the early days of cloud infrastructure, people were dismissive. I remember at MongoDB when we went from being an on-prem software company to building atlas, our cloud database service. Initially, our gross margins were basically zero. And people were wondering, well, are you going to build a real business...But we had confidence that you would drive this cost down. There was such a clear curve that you could walk down. And today the company has fabulous gross margins. The same is going to happen in AI." - Roelof Botha

He points to photovoltaics as precedent: "Solar today is less expensive than we thought it would be 15 years ago. And solar is actually producing more electricity today than we had predicted 15 years ago...It was actually underhyped."

### Contrarian View 2: Pain of Losses > Joy of Victories (Even at the Top)

Counter to narratives about "enjoying the journey," Roelof admits the asymmetry persists even after massive success.

**Experience:** "I think you'd find that most people who are very driven and competitive will say that there's an asymmetry and that the pain of a loss is far greater than the joy of a victory. I think you'll find that with most people that are driven and successful. And so I don't think you can wash that away or wave that away. I think it's a reality." - Roelof Botha

This contradicts the notion that success reduces competitive anxiety - it may actually intensify it.

### Contrarian View 3: Anonymous Voting & Removing Seniority from Investment Decisions

Most firms defer to senior partners or named individuals. Sequoia deliberately removes identity from initial analysis.

**Operational Evidence:** "We asked each team member to write a pre-mortem and a pre-parade for Sequoia in 2030...we anonymized each person's write up because we wanted to be untainted by the name or the seniority of the individual. We only wanted to focus on the merits of the ideas...When we do an initial vote on an investment on a Monday, we do it anonymously." - Roelof Botha

The philosophy: "We want the triumph of ideas, not the triumph of seniority." - Roelof Botha

### Contrarian View 4: Small Investment Teams Despite Massive Scale

While competitors expand teams with AUM growth, Sequoia keeps investor count artificially constrained.

**Reasoning:** "For us to be a leading firm in 2030, we thought we had to keep our investment team small. It was so important for us. I mean, in total, we have about 25 investors at Sequoia." - Roelof Botha

This is paired with: "We've invested in technology to give us more superpower. So we don't have to grow the size of the team to the point about what's coming out. There's not that many companies that are going to drive all of the returns."

### Contrarian View 5: Robotics Revenue is HERE, Not Future

Against the "robotics is years away" narrative, Roelof argues commercial traction exists today.

**Evidence:** "Skilled and Robco...all of them have revenue today, actually serving customers in a variety of different use cases, whether it's hospital systems, whether it's airport security, whether it's small manufacturing firms that need robotic assistance to help them scale. All these companies have revenue. They're actually up and running today." - Roelof Botha

The unlock wasn't just better AI but economic necessity: "The cost of labor in America is changing and that necessitates that. If you think about the way that minimum wages have gone for the restaurant industry in California, for example, it's driving many more restaurant chains in California to try to figure out solutions for automation because otherwise the business models don't work anymore."

## 3. Companies Identified

### **Zoom Video Communications**
**Description:** Video conferencing platform that scaled to massive ubiquity
**Quote:** "Zoom with a Z...was one of those investments that was not controversial. We all thought of a spectacular. The company was already generating cash. Eric had built a truly differentiated product in video conferencing and sort of belied all the naysayers that that was a tough category." - Roelof Botha

### **Spora**
**Description:** Non-resident Indian remittance services built on stablecoin infrastructure
**Quote:** "It's going to be called Spora. They provide non-resident Indian remittance services. And they're built on stablecoin infrastructure. So they're really reinventing the whole process and not dealing with the inter-bank system that's expensive and cumbersome and slow and non-transparent...I was the one person who listened to the presentation and I really liked the founder...And I was a little bit worried that there were a lot of risks in the business...I figured out, I'm the one who doesn't quite get it today...When we did the first portfolio review, I was relieved that we did make the investment
