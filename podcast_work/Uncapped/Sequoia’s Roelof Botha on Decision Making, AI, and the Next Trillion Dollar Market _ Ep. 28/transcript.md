# Transcript with Identified Speakers

[00:00:00] **Roelof Botha:** When you're in my shoes as sort of part of the third generation to run the partnership,
[00:00:03] this is an almost burden that Sequoia has been at the top of its game for a long time.
[00:00:07] **Jack Altman:** Yeah.
[00:00:07] **Roelof Botha:** And we have these legendary companies that we've participated in.
[00:00:10] It was something like 30% of the total value of the NASDAQ
[00:00:12] is comprised of companies we were investors in when they were private businesses.
[00:00:16] **Jack Altman:** I still don't understand how that happened, but that's crazy.
[00:00:18] **Roelof Botha:** Yeah.
[00:00:18] And so there's this expectation of what can you keep going?
[00:00:22] **Jack Altman:** I am super excited to be here with you today and I was just commenting to a friend
[00:00:26] that I was going to mess up your name before we started.
[00:00:28] So I haven't done this before, but could you introduce yourself?
[00:00:31] **Roelof Botha:** My name is Rolof Boetam.
[00:00:32] **Jack Altman:** I'm not even going to try.
[00:00:33] But you know, I've been really looking forward to this.
[00:00:35] This was also probably the best pre-chat conversation I've had
[00:00:39] where it turns out we both had a detached retina and this miserable surgery.
[00:00:43] So I feel like you don't have gotten to bond with you over that.
[00:00:46] **Roelof Botha:** It was brutal.
[00:00:47] **Jack Altman:** I hated it.
[00:00:48] **Roelof Botha:** This really loves company and we can certainly bond with that experience.
[00:00:51] **Jack Altman:** Just like in your eye.
[00:00:52] Okay, here's where I wanted to start.
[00:00:53] I was thinking about trying to put myself in your shoes
[00:00:56] and you're running what I think is widely considered the best strongest
[00:01:01] most storied venture capital firm and you've been running it for three years now.
[00:01:06] And the first place I wanted to start was tell me about your mentality on day one
[00:01:10] when you became, you know, the head, the steward of Sequoia
[00:01:14] and how is it evolved over three years?
[00:01:16] And what has updated for you in your mentality as a leader of the firm?
[00:01:21] **Roelof Botha:** Interesting.
[00:01:21] So the Sequoia has a long history of generational transfer.
[00:01:24] And so we have a very interesting culture where we
[00:01:29] aids the title stewardship.
[00:01:31] We are momentarily, we have the privilege of working in Sequoia
[00:01:35] and we have the duty to leave it for the next generation.
[00:01:38] And so even when I joined in 2003, I had the sense that there were people
[00:01:42] ahead of me who were willing to invest in me and nurture me and train me
[00:01:46] in a mentorship fashion and maybe down the road I'd be in a leadership position in Sequoia.
[00:01:50] So I think it says a lot about the culture that we have.
[00:01:52] And so we don't have a lot of discontinuities in our leadership.
[00:01:55] So when I joined and Michael Moritz and Doug Leoni were running the partnership,
[00:02:01] Don was still around. Don interviewed me.
[00:02:03] As the founder, he wasn't overbearing, but he was present and he provided counsel
[00:02:08] without having to be in the room.
[00:02:10] And if there was a disagreement, he respected that.
[00:02:13] I became the steward actually of the US business in 2017.
[00:02:17] Jim Getson, I've been running the US venture business since 2010.
[00:02:20] And then 2017, I took over all of the US business when Doug was our senior steward globally.
[00:02:25] And then as you said in 2022, I became senior steward and then
[00:02:30] but I think the point is that really that there's a lot more continuity than you may think
[00:02:34] from the outside. This week alone, I've spoken to both Doug and Jim.
[00:02:39] Both of who have been leaders here before about interesting topics that I needed their input on
[00:02:43] or wanted their input on. Not because they're the right to it,
[00:02:46] but because I want their help and that's the kind of spirit we have at Sequoia.
[00:02:49] **Jack Altman:** When you think about sort of what that steward role means,
[00:02:54] it struck me when I was speaking with Peter at benchmark.
[00:02:57] And one of the things I thought was really cool was there was this sense that it's
[00:03:00] like bigger than you. And when there's this thing that's been going for a long time
[00:03:04] and it's been passed from leader to leader and you're thinking about the future,
[00:03:08] obviously it's got some impact. But I'm curious how that shows up like day to day because like,
[00:03:14] you know, maybe we can get into this but take it like the opposite extreme like I just got started.
[00:03:18] Like obviously there's not like the steward concept makes no sense to me yet.
[00:03:22] Like I'm just at the beginning.
[00:03:23] **Roelof Botha:** So congratulations, by the way.
[00:03:25] **Jack Altman:** Thank you. Fundraising.
[00:03:26] **Roelof Botha:** Yeah, I'm assuming 75 million.
[00:03:28] **Jack Altman:** Yeah, that's nice.
[00:03:29] **Roelof Botha:** Yeah, nice.
[00:03:29] **Jack Altman:** It's a start.
[00:03:30] **Roelof Botha:** Get another competitor.
[00:03:31] **Jack Altman:** Absolutely. I'm a big one.
[00:03:33] **Roelof Botha:** 100%.
[00:03:34] **Jack Altman:** Collaborate.
[00:03:36] **Roelof Botha:** Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:36] **Jack Altman:** For now, you know, but I think I'd imagine in your shoes that daily there is a sort of
[00:03:41] presence behind it of like this thing is this thing is big.
[00:03:45] And it's there's something before me.
[00:03:46] There's something after me. Does it impact the way unique decisions or how you operate?
[00:03:51] **Roelof Botha:** It comes with an enormous amount of pressure.
[00:03:53] **Jack Altman:** Yeah, I would think in a done obviously made a wise decision to not call it valentine ventures,
[00:03:58] which was a revival option at the time.
[00:04:00] And most people would have put the names of the founders on the door back in those days for
[00:04:04] most professional services firms.
[00:04:06] And he called it sequer for a reason.
[00:04:08] Square trees can live to be 2000 years old.
[00:04:11] He wanted to have a partnership that would outlive him and invest in companies that would
[00:04:14] endure. So that was an important ingredient.
[00:04:16] I suspect it surpassed his expectations just as we are sometimes
[00:04:22] often always.
[00:04:24] It's a surprise to the surprise of the upside bow winners.
[00:04:27] But then when you're in my shoes as sort of part of the third generation to run the partnership,
[00:04:31] this is an almost burden that sequer has been at the top of its game for a long time.
[00:04:35] **Jack Altman:** Yeah.
[00:04:35] **Roelof Botha:** And we have these legendary companies that we've participated in.
[00:04:38] It was something like 30% of the total value of the NASDAQ is comprised of companies we were
[00:04:41] investors in when they were private businesses.
[00:04:43] **Jack Altman:** I still don't understand how that happened, but that's crazy.
[00:04:45] **Roelof Botha:** Yeah.
[00:04:45] And so there's this expectation of what can you keep going?
[00:04:48] **Jack Altman:** Yeah.
[00:04:48] **Roelof Botha:** Now, don't screw it up.
[00:04:50] And that comes with enormous pressure at some level.
[00:04:52] And so there's an important dynamic of how do you leverage this incredible platform that you have?
[00:04:58] I mean, I think we're all through privilege that we can do the best work we could possibly do
[00:05:01] because we have the benefit of the sequer brand.
[00:05:03] **Jack Altman:** Yeah.
[00:05:04] **Roelof Botha:** We can win investment opportunities, open doors for our founders,
[00:05:08] help them do things with their companies to help them realize their ambitions
[00:05:12] that I wouldn't be able to do if I was anywhere else.
[00:05:14] And that's an incredible privilege.
[00:05:16] And yet, we have to continue to innovate because I think there's a real temptation for
[00:05:20] leaders and industries to end up resting on their laurels.
[00:05:23] And you end up with the innovators dilemma where they stand still
[00:05:26] and they quickly become yesterday's winner.
[00:05:28] So actually, I did this exercise when I joined.
[00:05:30] If you look at the top venture firms in Silicon Valley in 1990,
[00:05:33] the majority of them no longer exist.
[00:05:35] There's a long half-life in the venture business,
[00:05:37] but there's no guarantee that you will succeed long-term.
[00:05:40] And so there's this insecurity that we have at Sequoia that really drives us.
[00:05:43] And it comes out in the sort of people we recruit,
[00:05:47] the culture we have, the idea that we need to be both performance-focused but also innovative.
[00:05:52] **Jack Altman:** How do you keep the paranoia or the sense that we're only as good as what we did yesterday?
[00:05:57] Because what I observe is there's a lot of firms that are good,
[00:06:01] but not Sequoia where there is much more of a sense of comfort and sort of
[00:06:07] maybe resting on laurels is too strong.
[00:06:08] I think venture is competitive in 2025 and I think most people are working hard,
[00:06:12] but I would say Sequoia is if there's a quadrant of how successful and long-standing the firm
[00:06:20] and how paranoid Sequoia somehow seems like it's really got both, which is weird.
[00:06:24] **Roelof Botha:** It's not always the easiest place to be, by the way.
[00:06:26] **Jack Altman:** Sounds stressful, by the way.
[00:06:27] **Roelof Botha:** It is very.
[00:06:27] Actually, if you come upstairs to our office with investors go grab coffee and snacks.
[00:06:33] On the wall, wall-to-wall, in each individual's handwriting, we have printed the handwriting that says,
[00:06:40] we are only as good as our next investment.
[00:06:43] And so every single day when I go grab a cup of coffee and I look at that wall,
[00:06:46] I see my own handwriting and it's a reminder, we are only as good as our next investment.
[00:06:50] We cannot rest on our laurels.
[00:06:52] And so I think some of that is the sort of people you recruit,
[00:06:56] some of that is the culture that we hone at Sequoia.
[00:06:59] We case so deeply if we lose an investment, we are very diligent about looking at the
[00:07:04] coverage analysis of what our competitors invested in.
[00:07:07] And did we have a shot of that investment?
[00:07:09] Did we miss it?
[00:07:09] Did we not understand it?
[00:07:11] Is there a category that's emerging that we're slow to identify?
[00:07:15] We obsess about that.
[00:07:17] So I think it's a cultural trade, you have to nurture that.
[00:07:19] And the cost is that it's stressful, right?
[00:07:23] **Jack Altman:** Yes, that's the only way.
[00:07:26] **Roelof Botha:** Yeah, but winning feels good.
[00:07:27] **Jack Altman:** Yeah, of course.
[00:07:28] It's interesting where actually I'm curious because if you're the Yankees, you expect to win.
[00:07:34] Is there any dynamic where it's like you become so deeply seated that the pain of losing
[00:07:40] hurts more than the joy of winning?
[00:07:42] Or how do you basically keep culturally this paranoia and we've got to stay there and keep it
[00:07:49] joyful where it's not just the sadness of losing and a relief when we win, but like a joy?
[00:07:56] **Roelof Botha:** I think you'd find that most people who are very driven and competitive will say that there's
[00:07:59] an asymmetry and that the pain of a loss is far greater than the joy of a victory.
[00:08:04] I think you'll find that with most people that are driven and successful.
[00:08:08] And so I don't think you can wash that away or wave that away.
[00:08:12] I think it's a reality.
[00:08:13] We have tried over the last decade, especially to do more to celebrate our victories.
[00:08:19] One of my partners, Jim, gets used to talk about how we don't do celebration while it's a
[00:08:24] choir. I think after the YouTube acquisition, we literally spend about 15 minutes.
[00:08:28] We're huddled around the reception area of our office and we said great and then it was back to our
[00:08:32] desks. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** And he was a little bit surprised that we don't take more time to celebrate.
[00:08:37] So we've tried a culturally to embrace celebration more and also to tell the stories.
[00:08:42] So one of the things I'm really proud of is every time there's a successful outcome.
[00:08:46] And most recently, we had the Clona IPO, the Figma IPO earlier this year, the Whiz acquisition.
[00:08:51] And we were early investors in all these companies. We would write an email internally.
[00:08:55] And we would celebrate not only the person who was then the board member,
[00:08:58] but everybody else that had an influence in that success.
[00:09:02] The person on our talent team that recruited that key executive that made a difference.
[00:09:06] Or the communications team that helped craft the narrative for the IPO story.
[00:09:10] Or our legal team that's been endless hours figuring out some nuance around governance
[00:09:14] or how the company was structured. Sometimes the people who did diligence or who found
[00:09:19] the company would not the people who would the board members by the time there was an exit.
[00:09:22] And so we celebrate everybody's contribution because we also play a team sport here.
[00:09:26] **Jack Altman:** What for you is like the most enjoyable part. Is it about the companies you're working with?
[00:09:32] Is it like something to do with the team? Is it like a purpose thing that's like
[00:09:35] greater than the day today? Like what drives your sort of satisfaction now?
[00:09:41] **Roelof Botha:** Interesting question. There were a couple of answers to that. I mean, probably the most important
[00:09:46] one is leaving Sequoia in a phenomenal place. And I'd love nothing more than a decade after
[00:09:54] I'm long gone in Sequoia, being able to look at the team and see them flourish.
[00:09:58] That is probably the thing I think about most. And if the team flourished,
[00:10:02] there has a lot of inputs to that. That means that we've maintained a certain culture,
[00:10:07] while we've continued to innovate. And it means that we're serving our founders.
[00:10:11] It's the development of individuals that I get a tremendous amount of joy in.
[00:10:15] Whether it's a young person who joined our investing team and a decade later,
[00:10:19] I see how they're flourishing. This is my favorite partner in a company.
[00:10:22] And it's individuals. **Jack Altman:** Yeah, just getting to see your team grow.
[00:10:24] **Roelof Botha:** And you know, you know, somebody joins when they're early in their career.
[00:10:28] And then you just see a completely different person five years later. It's very gratifying.
[00:10:31] **Jack Altman:** Yes. **Roelof Botha:** And the same with founders. I mean, the founders I've worked with, I think about MongoDB
[00:10:36] when we were an early investor in 2010 and what happened to them. I think about
[00:10:41] Jack when we first invested in Square 15 years ago. And the kind of company it's evolved into
[00:10:45] and how Jack has developed as a phenomenal business leader. I look at some of the more recent
[00:10:50] investments we've made because I've helped us lead three investments this year in a variety of
[00:10:55] categories. Not all the investments are publicized yet. But one of them is a, you know,
[00:11:00] is a young founder. First time company is a solo founder. And we had a fabulous 30 minute
[00:11:04] conversation yesterday about some of the challenges that he's dealing with. And just having
[00:11:09] a sounding board of me being able to talk to him to help him navigate a tricky issue.
[00:11:13] So much gratification that comes from that. **Jack Altman:** The ability to pay it forward. **Roelof Botha:** Totally.
[00:11:16] **Jack Altman:** When you think about Sequoia and its position in like an evolving venture landscape,
[00:11:22] I'd be curious to hear at sort of a zoomed out level how you're reading sort of the playing field
[00:11:27] today. And obviously we've got like a bunch of dynamics happening at once. Like you've got AI,
[00:11:32] obviously, is like the big tech wave that's going at the moment. There's others too. But like,
[00:11:36] that's the dominant one. You've got like a bunch of firms that are really scaling capital. Some are,
[00:11:40] you know, new, some are older. You've got firms that are institutional and sort of have been
[00:11:46] around for a long time. You've got sort of new up and coming founder led firms. I'm curious when
[00:11:51] you think about that whole landscape. Are you able to sort of give like a summary lay of the land
[01:11:56] of how you maybe like see things or what your framework for the venture world right now?
[00:12:00] **Roelof Botha:** Yeah. So we have the benefit of seeing many cycles over 50 years plus at Sequoia. Obviously,
[00:12:08] the scale of what technology impacts today is different from what it was a decade ago, two decades
[00:12:13] ago. Technology just affects far more of the world than I think we could have imagined.
[00:12:17] So the scale is different, but you know, history doesn't repeat it rhymes. And I see echoes of
[00:12:24] 1999. I see echoes of what happened in 2008. I see some echoes of what happened in 2021.
[00:12:29] **Jack Altman:** Happening now. **Roelof Botha:** Happening now. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** The claims that are gravity-defying. You know,
[00:12:34] this is different. You know, and I sort of go back to the principles of investing. You think
[00:12:37] about the truisms of Benjamin Graham's teachings. I think those remain. And things got a little
[00:12:44] unhinged in 1999. And it was different this time and it wasn't. And then it was different in 2008
[00:12:48] and then it wasn't. And so I just worry about that a little bit that AI will have a tremendous
[00:12:54] impact. And some of that there are innovations that you mentioned, whether it's in robotics,
[00:12:56] whether it's happening with stable coins and how that might change financial services.
[00:13:01] There's a lot of innovation happening. I'm really excited about the future we're going to build.
[00:13:04] We inevitably overestimate these in the short run. And I'm going to restimate them in the long run.
[00:13:09] **Jack Altman:** Yeah, I'm reminded of the fact that it seemed pretty obvious in 2000-2001 that e-commerce was
[00:13:14] going to be dominant. And yet here we are 25 years later and e-commerce is not even 20% of US
[00:13:19] purchases. **Roelof Botha:** That's crazy. **Jack Altman:** It's incredible. **Roelof Botha:** It's taken a long time. I think about how long it's
[00:13:23] taken us to do unbundling of cable. Didn't it seem obvious that media should go this way?
[00:13:29] And so I think human behavior changed a little more slowly than technology is presenting us with.
[00:13:34] So I think that'll take a little bit more time. I don't think venture is an asset class.
[00:13:40] **Jack Altman:** It doesn't support the numbers. **Roelof Botha:** So there was a lot of analysis back in the 1970s and 80s with
[00:13:46] the capital asset pricing model and people figured out that there's this asset class that supposedly
[00:13:50] has uncorrelated returns and a bunch of asset managers deemed that they need to invest a certain
[00:13:54] percentage of their endowment or foundation or pinching fund into this thing called venture capital.
[00:14:00] If you look at the data, they're basically 20 companies per year on average over the last
[00:14:04] 20-30 years. Then they've ended up being worth in realized exits of billion dollars or more.
[00:14:09] Just 20 companies. Despite a lot more money plowing into venture capital, we haven't seen a
[00:14:16] material change in the number of companies that are outcomes that are that large.
[00:14:20] And I think part of that is that there's a lot more talent than really interesting ideas or
[00:14:24] interesting companies to be built. And I think we're spreading a lot of that talent thin right now,
[00:14:28] similar to what happened in 1999, by the way. So when you look at the data, the amount of money
[00:14:33] going into venture capital right now in America is not order of $250 billion a year and the numbers,
[00:14:38] you know, these all estimates. Let's just say it's $250 billion a year.
[00:14:42] **Jack Altman:** A lot of exits. **Roelof Botha:** Well, let's do some very simple arithmetic for a second. $250 billion is going
[00:14:46] in every single year. If you assume that the firms generate 12% IRR's net, native fees and carry,
[00:14:54] which isn't that great, by the way. I mean, over the last three or four years, the NASDAQ has
[00:14:57] compounded at 16-17%. But you say 12%, not spectacular. You basically just average performance.
[00:15:03] You'd need a 3.7X on a 7-year exit horizon. So I'm being a little bit aggressive. I mean,
[00:15:09] maybe it won't even be that good. So 3.7X on 250 billion. That approximates to a trillion dollars a year.
[00:15:15] **Jack Altman:** Coming out. **Roelof Botha:** Coming out. By the way, that means, and that's what the investors own. So let's say that
[00:15:20] the investors own two-thirds of the company to make the arithmetic simple. That's 1.5 trillion annually
[00:15:25] in company exit value. **Jack Altman:** Yes. **Roelof Botha:** Just think about that for a second. Where's that coming from?
[00:15:30] Well, Figma's worth what? It's a lot of 40-ish billion. I mean, let's say it's worth the
[00:15:35] 0.03 trillion. So if you start thinking in trillions and Figma gets you 0.03 trillion,
[00:15:41] you need 30, 40, 50 Figma's every year to make that arithmetic work.
[00:15:48] It just, I don't see that many companies of that scale every year. So the only thing breaks
[00:15:53] is the return assumption doesn't hold. And so venture is a return-free risk.
[00:15:59] **Jack Altman:** Not a risk-free risk. **Roelof Botha:** You are better off investing in the index.
[00:16:04] **Jack Altman:** Or holding tables, honestly. **Roelof Botha:** And so I don't think venture is an asset class.
[00:16:08] As a class is scale, if you add more money, you can build more real estate. There's a lot of
[00:16:12] equities. There are trillions and trillions of bonds to be purchased. venture capital doesn't
[00:16:17] scale with more money. **Jack Altman:** I agree with you, but just to take collective, sort of just to take sort of
[00:16:22] what would the collective argument be that the herd is all betting is happening? I guess
[00:16:29] there could be two things. One argument would be these companies are going to be bigger than ever.
[00:16:32] This was kind of roughly what Mark Andrews and so on the podcast was something like
[00:16:36] there's going to be multi-trillion dollar companies in a way that they haven't been in the past.
[00:16:40] And you look at OpenAI and SpaceX and Anthropic and Android and so on. And there's a lot more
[00:16:45] coming out than there ever has been before. That's argument one. I guess the other argument is
[00:16:49] everybody thinks they're better than average driver. Everybody thinks they're better than average
[00:16:53] allocator as an LP and a GP. And so yes, the overall asset class isn't doing well, but I,
[00:16:59] particularly I'll be know how to pick the good ones. And so the top that style is going to be great.
[00:17:03] Do you think that there is wiseness in the number of dollars going in like where the, you know,
[00:17:08] overall industry is like does it make sense? Or is it collectively smarter, collectively stupid?
[00:17:14] **Roelof Botha:** Well, firstly, I agree with Mark that the scale that outcomes are completely different today.
[00:17:18] And we'll be even bigger in the future than they are now. So I'm not trying to be a lot
[00:17:21] I'd saying that we should go back to the way the business was. When I was at PayPal,
[00:17:26] there were roughly 300 million people on the planet that had access to the internet. And most of
[00:17:31] them were on dial up. And today we have what four billion people with, you know, high-speed
[00:17:35] mobile devices connected to the internet. We have all this data. I mean, so the world is completely
[00:17:39] different and the scale of the outcomes is much, much bigger. So I completely agree with that.
[00:17:43] It's just that I don't think there are enough of them. **Jack Altman:** Right. No, I hear the new answer saying
[00:17:47] is there might be one and a half trillion dollar companies. But is there one every year?
[00:17:52] **Roelof Botha:** That's tough and seem like it. That's the thing that is really challenging in this equation.
[00:17:56] I just don't think there are enough to make the math work for it to be an asset class.
[00:17:59] Is it an industry? Absolutely. Does it account for a lot of innovation in America to keep
[00:18:04] our economy competitive? Absolutely. Does it drive an enormous amount of job creation? Yes.
[00:18:09] All of those things are true. I just don't think it's an asset class. It's that particular word
[00:18:12] that I have an issue with. And the amount of money I think is an excess of what the industry can
[00:18:18] bear to generate good returns. So that is my quibble. And people thought that, you know,
[00:18:23] gravity, we got rid of gravity in 2021 and that we're going to have so many more
[00:18:28] spectacular outcomes. And it just did not prove to be true. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** Not enough to merit
[00:18:32] the amount of money going in. So I think there's a little bit of the prospect theory.
[00:18:36] **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** I think about Conorman and Tversky's original paper. I think there's a little bit of,
[00:18:40] you know, people are risk seeking in this domain with take a chance. Maybe I'll be lucky.
[00:18:45] You know, maybe I'll get the double zero on the real table and, you know,
[00:18:48] Naz my chance. I think that drives more of this behavior. **Jack Altman:** Let's say you were like, you know,
[00:18:52] on my board at all capital. What would you be pushing for me if you were like trying to give me
[00:18:57] advice or trying to push on the thing that a new manager, you know, getting started needs to do
[00:19:02] to be successful. If you want to build something that lasts, what would you be harping on?
[00:19:06] **Roelof Botha:** The network you build, the tributaries you develop for getting access to interesting emerging
[00:19:12] investment opportunities. This is not a business that you do sitting at a desk.
[00:19:17] You need to get out there. You need to be able to meet people and understand where
[00:19:23] interesting new founders are thinking about building businesses. And part of that is being smart
[00:19:28] with they want to have a conversation with you. So you need to, you know, study up if it's not
[00:19:33] your field necessarily. Can you study up on the categories that they're innovating on so that
[00:19:37] you can have interesting conversations that are memorable to them because it is a competitive
[00:19:41] business. And then you need to be congenial. People want to do business with people. **Jack Altman:** Yeah.
[00:19:46] When you think about the best investments that you've made over the last, I don't know,
[00:19:51] let's say five years or something, do you feel like more of them are deals that were controversial
[00:19:57] at the time and you picked something that was hard to pick as a firm? Or do you think it was deals
[00:20:03] that were clearly good and competitive and you won them through relationships and efforts and
[00:20:08] all the rest? **Roelof Botha:** A bit of both. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. Like if you had to like bucket them, do you feel like it's
[00:20:12] like a good mix? **Roelof Botha:** It is a good mix. I mean, zoom with a Z or Z as I grew up saying was one of those
[00:20:20] investments that was not controversial. We all thought of a spectacular. The company was already
[00:20:25] generating cash. Eric had built a truly differentiated product in Vita conferencing and sort of
[00:20:31] belied all the naysayers that that was a tough category. And the challenge was winning the investment.
[00:20:37] And we were able to win that investment. And that was that was a case where we were all above
[00:20:41] the line, so to speak, in our internal voting system. And then there are other ones that are
[00:20:45] maybe a little more controversial, where it's a little more fuzzy. We had one actually last year.
[00:20:52] It's in the, it's going to be called a spora. They provide non-resident Indian
[00:20:58] remittance services. And they're built on stablecoin infrastructure. So they're really reinventing
[00:21:04] the whole process and not dealing with the inter-bank system that's expensive and cumbersome and
[00:21:08] slow and non-transparent. And honestly, that was a case where I didn't quite get it. I was the
[00:21:12] one person who listened to the presentation and I really liked the found a path. I thought
[00:21:16] he was super dynamic. And I was a little bit worried that there were a lot of risks in the business.
[00:21:20] And then I looked at the assessment from the rest of the team and I figured out, I'm the one who
[00:21:25] doesn't quite get it today. Maybe I maybe didn't sleep well. Maybe I got out of the wrong side
[00:21:29] of the bed this morning. And so we looked at the vote distribution. And I said, despite my inclination,
[00:21:33] we should absolutely make this investment. We did. And when we did the first portfolio review,
[00:21:39] I was relieved that we did make the investment because the company's absolutely flourishing and I'm
[00:21:43] glad I didn't block it. **Jack Altman:** Which is actually probably super important as a firm leader to be like,
[00:21:48] you've got things about your vantage point that are going to help, but trusting the team in those
[00:21:53] kind of cases, obviously, it's a good, good reminder. **Roelof Botha:** Yeah. And I think the, thank you for saying
[00:21:57] that. The one thing we've realized when there are controversial decisions, you sometimes have
[00:22:02] one or two people who don't quite get it. And we make consensus investment decisions at Sequoia.
[00:22:08] Actually, when I joined Sequoia, it blew my mind that that was the case. It's sort of, I thought
[00:22:11] that committees were the, you know, this is exactly where bad ideas happen. And then I understood
[00:22:16] that Sequoia has this approach to teamwork, which means that every time we make an investment,
[00:22:20] it's our investment. It's not your investment. It's our investment. That it means that six months
[00:22:24] down the road, when you need help hiring somebody or you have a strategic question, I'm helping you.
[00:22:29] I'm not going to brush it off and say, it's your problem. You made that investment over my
[00:22:32] objection. So I understood the power of us making investments as a team. But that means that sometimes
[00:22:38] you have a controversial investment where one person is a negative and everybody else sees it.
[00:22:42] And Airbnb was a little bit like this. When the three founders came in, it was, I mean,
[00:22:46] it was, I mean, it was air bed and breakfast at the time. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** It was just the three founders.
[00:22:49] It was a nascent company. And there were a few people in the partnership who struggled with this idea
[00:22:53] that really strangers are going to stay in each other's rooms. I mean, is that going to happen?
[00:22:58] Those people were willing to go with the conviction of the sponsors and gave the full support
[00:23:03] after we had the conversation and didn't block it. So I think we've tried to harness that kind
[00:23:08] of decision process. **Jack Altman:** You still have a forthright conversation, but we empower those who have
[00:23:12] conviction. Do you need to ultimately get a unanimous yes from something like as part of the deal
[00:23:17] there that like, there's a sponsor and they have to convince other people or can you get through
[00:23:21] somebody who's like, I still think we shouldn't do this. **Roelof Botha:** But we've done with our wedding distribution
[00:23:25] as we discuss investment opportunities is we want to have a full-throwed,
[00:23:30] a full contact conversation as we call it. And it has to be about the merits of the investment
[00:23:34] by the way. It's nothing personal. As soon as you walk out of the room, it's as though nothing
[00:23:38] had happened. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** Because it's very important. **Jack Altman:** It's so hard to have that. It's so powerful
[00:23:42] when you have it. **Roelof Botha:** It requires a lot of, I mean, maybe you could do it with people like each other,
[00:23:46] but I feel like you have to like each other and you have to trust each other. **Jack Altman:** The key is to trust
[00:23:49] each other by the way. **Roelof Botha:** And one of the things we do when we have our off-sides, we do these
[00:23:52] checkings with each other. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** And almost every time we do a check in somebody cries,
[00:23:57] at least one person cries. And people talk about what's happening with family health issues.
[00:24:01] They talk about challenges they're having with one of the portfolio companies. Whatever is,
[00:24:06] we have an incredibly transparent conversation with each other and it's we've done all these
[00:24:10] other things to build trust. Because that's what you need. You need that that well of trust if
[00:24:15] you're going to have these kind of investment conversations. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** So the idea is to lay it all out.
[00:24:19] And if I don't quite see it the way you do, I'm going to give you my full opinion.
[00:24:24] And then at the end of the conversation, if I feel that you've really listened to my objections,
[00:24:28] you've weighed them, you've digested them, maybe you've come back a week later and you've
[00:24:32] actually answered some of the diligence questions. And you say, listen, I hear your objections,
[00:24:36] but I see it this way. I then have to decide, I'm going to block it or I'm going to say,
[00:24:41] I'm glad you heard it. I don't quite see it the same way, but I'm going to ride with your
[00:24:45] conviction. And that's part of the nuance of a subtle investment conversation that we have to
[00:24:49] get right. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. And if you don't have that, the alternative is like, I think this is a terrible
[00:24:54] idea. And I'm just going to like graciously bite my tongue and then like complain about it to
[00:24:58] somebody else in the firm later, which I think is a common state of dysfunction and venture.
[00:25:02] **Roelof Botha:** Yeah. We have this phrase front stabbing. Like if you say something bad, stay to them. **Jack Altman:** Yeah.
[00:25:08] It's really hard. It requires a certain culture. **Roelof Botha:** It's hard. And that's why I'm exhausted at the end
[00:25:12] of Monday's by the way. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** But at the end of a Monday partner conversation, I think our whole
[00:25:17] team feels this way because we're thinking about making really consequential decisions.
[00:25:21] By the way, it's part of why we keep our Mondays very light. Like Mondays, it's like the Olympic
[00:25:25] Finals. This is when we make investment decisions. That's what we're getting paid to do.
[00:25:29] **Jack Altman:** How do you avoid people being afraid to give you like the front stab? Because I'm sure you want it.
[00:25:34] **Roelof Botha:** You're right. Because we want the triumph of ideas, not the triumph of seniority. It's really
[00:25:40] important. So to give you one sentence, we had an offside in 2019 where we were debating
[00:25:45] certain strategic decisions for Sequoia. And we asked each team member to write a pre-mortem
[00:25:49] and a pre-parade for Sequoia in 2030. So this was in 2019. So it was roughly a 10-year horizon.
[00:25:55] And this pre-mortem pre-parade, we put it on investment memos as well. And then we anonymized
[00:26:00] each person's write up because we wanted to be untainted by the name or the seniority of the
[00:26:06] individual. We only wanted to focus on the merits of the ideas and the criticisms and the,
[00:26:11] you know, what might go right, what might go wrong. When we do an initial vote on an investment
[00:26:17] on a Monday, we do it anonymously. **Jack Altman:** How many people are in that Monday meeting? Like how big a
[00:26:21] group can you have? **Roelof Botha:** Looking at things together. So we separate our early team and our growth
[00:26:26] teams conversations. And then we get everybody's vote even if they're not yet a managing member
[00:26:30] because we want everybody's input. So it's roughly a dozen people. For each fund, we only have six
[00:26:35] technical decision makers because we think you want to have a small number of people actually
[00:26:38] feel the accountability and the heat for the final investment decision. But we have a dozen
[00:26:43] people who would vote because somebody who might have joined a euro go might have the right insight.
[00:26:46] It might be the person who just graduated who has a fabulous connection or a fabulous insight
[00:26:51] on the new emerging technology. We want to harness their insights. But we look at an anonymous
[00:26:56] vote distribution. And if you look at that, you go, we have three people that are below the line.
[00:27:01] That's interesting. And how do we tease that out in the conversation to really have a proper
[00:27:06] conversation? **Jack Altman:** When you think about like natural limits to scaling a venture firm effectively,
[00:27:12] obviously, we just talked about like the money and money out thing. It would strike me. And I was
[00:27:16] like, you know, we're very smart. But it would strike me. **Roelof Botha:** How many people do you have in your
[00:27:20] phone? **Jack Altman:** There's three others beside you plus three. **Roelof Botha:** Yeah. **Jack Altman:** Another one on the investment team was
[00:27:24] some of that. We all kind of, I mean, it's so early that we're all sort of like working together.
[00:27:28] You know, and I'm like, they're all earlier in their career than me. But like it's a team that
[00:27:32] like what you're describing, like I trust a lot and who will tell me when I'm, you know,
[00:27:36] when they think what I'm saying is stupid or when I don't, I will very much defer to their judge,
[00:27:40] like their judgment. I think I don't have any particular reason to think that my judgment is
[00:27:44] any better. And so, you know, there's advantages and disadvantages to all this stuff. But I think of
[00:27:49] it very much as like a team where I know about myself that I'm too optimistic. And I believe in
[00:27:56] people too much. And I think any idea can work. And I am dreaming about the future all the time.
[00:28:01] I just know about myself. **Roelof Botha:** You know, I like, I need to be optimistic. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. I need to be
[00:28:05] those people who remind me that most companies aren't big. And that's just how it works.
[00:28:07] **Roelof Botha:** That's like my starting point in the world that like go around liking everybody.
[00:28:10] So you just gotta be careful. **Jack Altman:** If you don't, that's your state. **Roelof Botha:** Interesting. But by the way,
[00:28:14] it's useful sometimes to point to devil's advocate. So not again, when we have a situation where
[00:28:18] everybody's above the line, I might privately message somebody in the Zoom chat and just say,
[00:28:22] listen, do you mind being the devil's advocate? And just so we can actually have a proper conversation
[00:28:27] and reassess. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** So you might want to think about that as a technique. I'd certainly
[00:28:30] helped us a bit. **Jack Altman:** But like I would think that past a certain size group, it becomes like I felt
[00:28:35] this with like my exact team at lattice where, you know, we would go through these evolutions where,
[00:28:39] you know, the exact team grows and grows. And then at some point, the exact meeting becomes useless.
[00:28:42] And then we would split into like a broader exact and a senior team meeting or whatever. And like
[00:28:46] that evolution happened many times. **Roelof Botha:** Yeah. **Jack Altman:** I would think there's some limit to the number of people
[00:28:49] you can have working on team. **Roelof Botha:** You know, you talked about like, you know, going deep enough
[00:28:52] with people that people can like share things that make them cry. Like you just can't do that with
[00:28:56] a big group. **Jack Altman:** Yes. **Roelof Botha:** I guess that's a limiter to a what a venture firm can do. **Jack Altman:** I would complete.
[00:29:01] **Roelof Botha:** Or at a subunit decision making. So we have an early team and a growth team in Sequoia. So the early
[00:29:06] team, we have about a dozen people in the room, the growth team, we have about a dozen people in the
[00:29:09] room. **Jack Altman:** Right. **Roelof Botha:** No more than that, I think, to make effective investment decisions. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** Because you
[00:29:13] need that trust. You need that sense of camaraderie. **Jack Altman:** There wasn't even enough time with each other.
[00:29:18] **Roelof Botha:** You know, we have, you know, of all the GPs, I think it's a quite an hour. Everybody's been here
[00:29:22] basically for at least five years. So we've had many years of working together and understanding each
[00:29:27] other's nuances and traits and quirks. **Jack Altman:** You can have a heated discussion. You're so friends
[00:29:31] afterwards. **Roelof Botha:** Exactly. So, and I think there's a lot of behavioral science research on group size,
[00:29:37] you know, for effects of decision making. And it doesn't. It's about the upper bound of what
[00:29:40] you can do. You know, there's this phrase that the camel is the horse that was designed by the
[00:29:45] committee. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** We don't have a committee making decisions. We have a small group of people
[00:29:48] making decisions. And I think, you know, by the way, that's one of the conclusions of that 2019
[00:29:52] offside we had was for us to be a leading firm in 2030. We thought we had to keep our investment
[00:29:59] team small. It was so important for us. I mean, in total, we have about 25 investors that's
[00:30:03] a square. **Jack Altman:** That's it. **Roelof Botha:** And what we've done is we've invested in technology to give us more
[00:30:08] superpower. So we don't have to grow the size of the team to the point about what's coming out.
[00:30:12] There's not that many companies that are going to drive all of the returns. And so you
[00:30:17] shouldn't need that many people to find your way into those over time, I would think,
[00:30:21] particularly when you can invest at many stages. I mean, the caveat here would be at early,
[00:30:25] it seems extremely hard to catch everything. **Jack Altman:** One of the things that I'm jealous of that you
[00:30:29] have is the multi stages. You can miss things at seed and the A and you can track it and then you
[00:30:33] can go lead the B and the C if you want to. And that does seem like a powerful thing. Obviously,
[00:30:40] the earlier the better and we chatted for a little bit before about how you kind of always need
[00:30:45] to be in the business of early, I believe, which I strongly believe that, but it does seem like
[00:30:48] you have the advantages where like on some level, I imagine if I'm in your seat, I would be like,
[00:30:54] I need to no matter when I end, I need to be in every important company at some point, roughly
[00:30:59] speaking. Is that kind of how you think about it? **Roelof Botha:** It's a way of running the business of buying posters.
[00:31:06] We want to be business partners to founders that make a difference and build great long-term
[00:31:10] companies. And in almost every single case, we are on the boards of these companies by the
[00:31:15] invitation of the founder who once I set their side as they navigate tricky issues in their
[00:31:20] business. Alfred is still in the board of DoorDash years after it's gone public, helping them
[00:31:25] think through their international expansion strategy and becoming the last mile of commerce in
[00:31:29] general. I'm still in the board of Mongo and Square, which were investments from more than a decade
[00:31:35] ago because the founders still want me on the boards. So I think we want that association.
[00:31:39] **Jack Altman:** You're right that it's convenient in some level that you might catch them later, but that's also
[00:31:44] risky because it means that there's a risk of complacency. Oh, I don't have to make the seat
[00:31:49] investment. If it works out, I'll catch them in 12 months or I'll catch them, you know, for the
[00:31:53] B. **Roelof Botha:** And so we obsess about making the right decision at every single stage, which is never
[00:31:58] let yourself off the hook. You can't. I mean, that's, and by the way, part of the joy is being able
[00:32:03] to participate in a company building journey from the gate, go, helping those founders from
[00:32:07] from that initial idea before Lionel Codos was told for relationship and navigating all the
[00:32:12] tricky issues. I mean, it's so much, by the way, just from a fun point of view, those are the
[00:32:15] point that's the form of time. It's so much fun to be part of the company, you know, from those
[00:32:20] early stages. And so we love that and we love doubling down on the companies when, you know,
[00:32:24] **Jack Altman:** I mean, I do think when you join at a series B or C and you've got special people, you know,
[00:32:30] I know, you know, like, pack radio, ratti goot, you know, it's like, there's people who can still
[00:32:35] become kind of the partner of record, even at the beer, the sea. **Roelof Botha:** Absolutely. **Jack Altman:** A member. So,
[00:32:39] you know, it's not so late, but the all the, like, glue is dry or something. **Roelof Botha:** Oh, absolutely. There's
[00:32:43] a tremendous, I mean, that's part of why we remain on all the companies sometimes off to the
[00:32:47] go public. There's a lot to do from there. There's a long runway. And that's why we created the
[00:32:50] Sequoia Capital Fund in 2022, because we believe so much that the upside can be in these companies
[00:32:55] long after the go public. I'm going to give you a sense. Service now hubs about MongoDB all in
[00:33:01] recent memory parallel to networks. These are all companies that are 10 x returns after the IPO.
[00:33:06] So we believe there's a lot of money to be made for Alps after the IPO, but there's also a lot of
[00:33:11] fun company building to be done. So you're absolutely right that there's a lot of company building
[00:33:15] all along the way, but it's so much fun to be part of it from inception. And so we can't
[00:33:19] rational laurels. We just can't take comfort in the fact that we might catch them later. I mean,
[00:33:23] you know, Figma is an example of a company that we're Andrew helped us lead the investment
[00:33:27] from our growth fund. We led the series C and boy, the early team, you know, we're kicking themselves,
[00:33:33] you know, at the time that we first made Dylan, this idea of the browser being sufficiently
[00:33:38] formant to realize Figma's vision, it wasn't quite yet obvious. And we didn't get it right. And
[00:33:43] boy, do we beat ourselves up for not getting it right? **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** We're delighted we got it later. **Jack Altman:** Yeah.
[00:33:47] But we keep trying to learn from that lesson. **Roelof Botha:** It's also like when you do it early and then you
[00:33:51] lead, you know, like, I think with WhatsApp, you let like a bunch of rounds and you end up with
[00:33:55] like these unbelievable results. Like you, you can only have those dynamics happen when you,
[00:33:59] you know, really just keep doing all those early rounds, I guess, too. So there's that. **Jack Altman:** Yeah,
[00:34:03] we've often doubled down whether it was at service now, whether it was at WhatsApp, whether it was
[00:34:07] MongoDB, the W and the Airbnb door dash. I mean, a lot of these examples were we've kept on
[00:34:12] investing in great companies down the road. **Roelof Botha:** I find that more impressive almost than a single good
[00:34:17] investment decision, even like, you know, one scene investment. I'm like, obviously, it's still
[00:34:21] impressive when you get a good one or, you know, it's sad when you miss it when you do it wrong. But
[00:34:25] like, um, there's so many of these decisions when, you know, the first decision, a first,
[00:34:29] you know, round decision, where you're on the cost when you barely pass or you barely, you know,
[00:34:34] say, yes, to me, when firms can do the round over and over and keep making a correct decision,
[00:34:40] you know, in a, you know, market can train where they seem to be overpaying or they seem to,
[00:34:44] you know, they own 25% but they lead a whole nother round when they don't really have to,
[00:34:47] they're already so exposed. There's something more impressive about that to me. **Jack Altman:** Yeah.
[00:34:51] **Roelof Botha:** It seems harder to do, especially I would imagine like, you know, once you're already like a few
[00:34:54] rounds in, there's something about that that really impresses me. **Jack Altman:** We didn't always get it right,
[00:34:59] but I agree with you that it's, it's impressive when it can happen. And part of it is the
[00:35:04] psychological anchoring we're all subject to. **Roelof Botha:** Yes. **Jack Altman:** You know, we're just invested in this company
[00:35:08] seed. Now it's 10 times more expensive five months later. Really? I mean, why, **Roelof Botha:** so we double down on
[00:35:14] the company called Listen Labs recently Alfred and Florian building this company to bring AI
[00:35:18] to market research companies on fire love this investment. We made a seed investment,
[00:35:23] you know, roughly two years ago and then we doubled down on the series A. But we under a lot,
[00:35:27] we're in the seed and why don't we list somebody else lead the A and it's a very interesting
[00:35:31] conversation to have and then we plunge in and you make the series A investment and you're delighted.
[00:35:37] **Jack Altman:** Now the other next question would be the be obviously. **Roelof Botha:** I would think it takes a lot of,
[00:35:40] it takes a very clinical mindset to be untethered to that stuff. **Jack Altman:** Yeah, clinical and emotional
[00:35:45] without being a sociopath. **Roelof Botha:** Yeah. **Jack Altman:** One of the things I've really thought about a lot is
[00:35:52] behavioral economics and psychology and how it applies to investing. And we're all subject to it.
[00:35:58] I'm, you know, I'm as guilty as the next person of falling prey to heuristics. The key is,
[00:36:04] when you can identify and name them and when you educate your team about it and we can all
[00:36:08] hold each other accountable to it, you can get over these biases more effectively. **Roelof Botha:** Yeah.
[00:36:13] **Jack Altman:** And we actually have started to put this in some of our investment demos where we'll actually
[00:36:17] write down the biases, the author thinks they're guilty of as they're recommending a particular
[00:36:22] investment because the more you can name it, the more you can discuss it and look at it clinically
[00:36:26] to the point that you're making. **Roelof Botha:** I've heard of some firms where you're not with the partner who
[00:36:30] did the initial investment is not allowed to make the call on a double down because it's too hard,
[00:36:35] they believe it's too hard to like just send yourself and that you can either have the
[00:36:40] version where you just like become too obsessed and you go native and you're like, this is
[00:36:44] back into the end of the earth or, you know, the other direction where you're like, you know,
[00:36:47] all the warts and nooks and crannies. And so you just like don't see it as cleanly as somebody
[00:36:52] who's coming in with fresh eyes or something, which is kind of an interesting way to go around it.
[00:36:55] **Jack Altman:** We definitely get fresh eyes on it. We still want to harness the inside of the person who is
[00:37:00] working closely with the company and compliment that with somebody who brings a slightly third-body
[00:37:04] perspective. **Roelof Botha:** A lot of focus right now in like AS how for company goes to the product,
[00:37:08] which is obviously very new and interesting and AI's powering that. I'm curious to talk to you
[00:37:13] about the other side of it, which is like the cost structure. I know you've spoken about this,
[00:37:17] you know, in other places, but I find it very interesting and kind of under-disgust.
[00:37:21] Before getting into how it applies in like AI times, which I think is like new interesting
[00:37:25] dynamics, how do you think about the component of costs for a startup building a company,
[00:37:31] it's product, it's got a market, everything. **Jack Altman:** It's a very unsexy thing to talk about, you know,
[00:37:36] because what certainly what most journalists want to write about is the snazzy new product
[00:37:40] innovation and the features that are so cool and WestBang. And then I tell people, cost is the
[00:37:45] secret of Silicon Valley and they look at me very puzzled and unpack it for them slowly,
[00:37:50] which is I think relentless cost reduction is actually a far bigger ingredient to Silicon
[00:37:55] Valley success than most people realize. And some of that makes technology available to many more
[00:38:00] people and it democratizes access if you want to think about it that way, whether it's the
[00:38:04] little square reader that turned every mobile phone into a credit card terminal, whether it was
[00:38:08] the way that SpaceX reduced the cost of travel to space by an order of magnitude or Google's
[00:38:13] innovation in its data centers. Let me just look at industry after industry.
[00:38:18] Cost reduction has enabled technologies ubiquity. And so I think people need to obsess about that.
[00:38:24] There are two pieces of it. One is the gross margin that goes into the cost of your particular
[00:38:28] product and the other one is the fixed cost of running your business. I think today, partly because
[00:38:34] of current infrastructure, mobile technology and our AI, the basic cost of running a business
[00:38:39] is lower than it's ever been. I think it's a continuum, by the way. So 25 years ago when I was
[00:38:45] the CFO at PayPal, we would cut checks to Oracle for databases and sun for servers. Five years later,
[00:38:51] when YouTube came around, we were using mySQL, memcache, a bunch of really good open source software
[00:38:57] and we started to use the beginning of cloud infrastructure. We didn't actually have to stand up
[00:39:01] a color facility. We could use commodity servers. Google obviously took that to another extreme.
[00:39:07] When YouTube was acquired, it had about 50 people in the company. I think in WhatsApp was acquired
[00:39:12] by Facebook that about 30 odd employees. When Instagram got acquired, another company we invested
[00:39:18] in early on. Kevin and Mike, that company had about 20 people roughly speaking at the time
[00:39:23] we got acquired and I think there's this potential that you can end up with a company that has
[00:39:27] literally single digits of employees and is worth a billion dollars. I think that's around the
[00:39:32] corner and it's this incredible availability of infrastructure for scaling and it's a magic time
[00:39:40] to be a founder. So that's on the fixed cost, but you still need to think about your module cost
[00:39:45] and I think the founders that really succeed in my mind are obsessed with understanding how they
[00:39:50] drive down the cost to serve the customers and they end up with very high gross margins. **Roelof Botha:** Why is
[00:39:55] it so important to have high gross margins? On some level, you want to make money dropped
[00:40:00] about them online, but I think it's deeper than that. I'm curious, why does this rise to the level
[00:40:05] of a secret of Silicon Valley? **Jack Altman:** I think there's a misunderstanding where people often think that
[00:40:09] price is a competitive advantage. What's the secret to your company's success? I'm going to price
[00:40:13] lower. That's not an advantage. Cost is an advantage. If you have a fundamental cost advantage of
[00:40:18] a competitor, you might price the same and just end up with a high gross margins. Maybe you
[00:40:23] price a little lower. Maybe you have the same gross margin, percentages of your competitor,
[00:40:27] but you can price below them and gain market share because your costs are fundamentally lower.
[00:40:32] And so I think the reason I obsess about cost is it gives you the degrees of freedom to choose
[00:40:37] how to play the game. And when you think about being powerful in business, when you dictate the
[00:40:41] rules, that's how you can end up succeeding. **Roelof Botha:** If you're talking to a founder about this and they say,
[00:40:46] I don't have lower costs right now, but I will. In the interim, I can raise a ton of money
[00:40:52] because of XYZ. Does that argument land for you? Or do you say that's just like a hope in a dream
[00:40:59] and we don't think about it that way? **Jack Altman:** The question there is, what is the logic training?
[00:41:03] Is there evidence to support the hypothesis? So when we were an early investor in Gordash,
[00:41:07] we led the series A. Tony showed us the unit economics that he had at a city level.
[00:41:14] And there was a point in time when the company needed to raise expansion capital
[00:41:17] where the burn rate was increasing. And so if you looked at the company's financially
[00:41:20] superficially, you might have concluded that it isn't building a viable business.
[00:41:24] But if you peel the onion and you went down to a basic unit level and you actually understood
[00:41:28] the profitability in a particular town, town by town, you saw that the business was working.
[00:41:32] And the reason it was burning more money is they were expanding and building new markets,
[00:41:37] but they perfected the playbook. And I think that's a kind of diligence that you need to understand.
[00:41:41] So that's why we doubled down on Gordash to the early conversation and we're delighted we did
[00:41:46] because Tony understood the unit economics of his business. And he has a
[00:41:52] detailed understanding of his business, which is unrivaled. **Roelof Botha:** I also think in the long term,
[00:41:57] this margin question is to me, it basically tells you what you can afford to spend
[00:42:02] building your company. One day you want to make money as a company. So let's just say you want
[00:42:06] to be profitable. You've got like 100% of your revenue that you can spend on everything.
[00:42:10] If you've got 80% of that left for R&D, go to market, everything else, like that,
[00:42:15] like afford to certain envelope. But if you've got 20% left, it's like, okay,
[00:42:20] how many companies have a really good R&D org that's 6% of revenue, like not many?
[00:42:24] Like most of the great ones for whatever reason, like the R&D org seemed to be a lot higher than that.
[00:42:28] And maybe they'll change over time. But I also think of it as this like offense where it lets you
[00:42:32] spend a bunch more on project marketing. **Jack Altman:** Profits of power. **Roelof Botha:** Profits of power. **Jack Altman:** That's what you want
[00:42:40] to focus on. So that gives you the interesting thing about empires, by the way, relative to just
[00:42:44] regions or countries or nations, empires have flexible borders and relentless ambition.
[00:42:50] And I think about the great companies have those two characteristics. Flexible borders means they
[00:42:55] keep on innovating and pushing the boundaries on interesting new innovations. They expand into
[00:42:58] categories and maybe were unanticipated and novel, you know, unexpected. And they're relentless.
[00:43:05] And that ambition is part of why you create these great companies. But you need profits to fuel that.
[00:43:11] **Roelof Botha:** I want to just connect really quickly to the like cost structure in AI world. Because obviously
[00:43:17] margins on like if SaaS companies before AI were often 80% a lot or lower now. They're not like zero,
[00:43:24] some are zero, but a lot are 60 or four, you know, whatever. But like there's these costs in there.
[00:43:29] And then everybody's kind of collectively assuming that like the price of intelligence will go down
[00:43:33] at like a certain rate. And so you can kind of capture market at a certain speed. And you know,
[00:43:39] these markets are blue ocean right now, but they won't be for long. And so like when you're trying
[00:43:43] ulating and reasoning through these dynamics right now, how do you look at this when you see a company
[00:43:48] that's a SaaS company with a 40% margin because they're using a lot of compute?
[00:43:53] **Jack Altman:** So I think this is a really good question. It's a contemporary question because a lot of people
[00:43:56] are looking at the current margin structure of these, especially AI application companies. And
[00:44:00] wondering if it's a sustainable or good business given the margin structure. And there's so
[00:44:05] many parallels to think about in general in business, this is idea of an experienced cost curve
[00:44:10] that as you increase production in the particular industry production, you know, conceptually,
[00:44:15] you end up with a very predictable curve on how costs decrease. And there's an economist and a
[00:44:20] British economist right back I think in the 19th century originally coined this and actually
[00:44:25] modeled it very accurately. If you go back to what happened in the photovoltaic industry,
[00:44:30] solo today is less expensive than we thought it would be 15 years ago. And solo is actually producing
[00:44:36] more electricity today than we had predicted 15 years ago. You don't read about this often. People
[00:44:41] often think that, you know, solo was over hyped 15 years. It was actually underhyped. We failed
[00:44:46] to understand how it compounds. And a lot of people have written about, you know, humans don't
[00:44:50] intuit compound interest. Anthropologically, you know, understanding compounding didn't benefit us
[00:44:55] and, you know, when we were hunter-gatherers or whatever the case is. And so we don't quite
[00:44:59] anticipate that. And so I remember in the early days of cloud infrastructure, people were dismissive.
[00:45:04] I remember at MongoDB when we went from being a on-prem software company to building atlas,
[00:45:10] our cloud databases service. Initially, our gross margins were basically zero. And people were
[00:45:15] wondering, well, are you going to build a real business, you know, being a cloud database as a
[00:45:18] service because the cost is so high. But we had confidence that you would drive this cost down.
[00:45:22] There was such a clear curve that you could walk down. And today the company has fabulous gross
[00:45:26] margins. The same is going to happen in AI. I think, you know, if the company has product market
[00:45:30] for today, the cost of tokens is going to keep on coming down very aggressively. I think that
[00:45:35] algorithms are going to improve. The scale is going to increase. You have open source models
[00:45:39] are going to compete against some of the proprietary models. And I wouldn't not invest or not believe
[00:45:44] that the company isn't going to be able to improve its gross margins. I would bear on that all day long.
[00:45:47] **Roelof Botha:** Do you think that we, in some sense, need the rate of progress of frontier models to slow
[00:45:54] because the faster that they're progressing, the more people are willing to pay for the frontier
[00:45:58] and then the margin improvements never come. Or do you think they'll come even if the models
[00:46:02] keep getting better and better for the next 20 years? **Jack Altman:** Oh, I think they'll keep coming because the
[00:46:07] application space is very, and I spoke to one of our founders, Max, who runs a company called
[00:46:12] Fair. And he described to me how they're using an ensemble of different models for different
[00:46:16] use cases in the company. And they use some cheap ones and some cases and expensive ones and so
[00:46:20] **Roelof Botha:** exactly. **Jack Altman:** In certain cases, the application is relatively low value and paying for the latest
[00:46:25] greatest frontier model doesn't make economic sense, but they can sacrifice the quality and speed
[00:46:31] with an open source model. And the cost benefit works in the particular application and other
[00:46:35] applications, it doesn't. They need to use the frontier model. **Roelof Botha:** So basically in a world where you'll
[00:46:39] use the frontier for some percentage, but not 100%. Probably some very cheap stuff for some large
[00:46:44] percent. **Jack Altman:** Depending on the cost benefit, you know, and I love the fact that if the frontier
[00:46:49] models keep pushing, you'll get a continuum. You'll have so many choices for picking the right
[00:46:54] model for the use case that you have. **Roelof Botha:** To go back to what you said earlier, I thought it was
[00:46:59] interesting that, you know, empires are relentless ambition and open source. **Jack Altman:** Flexible borders.
[00:47:04] **Roelof Botha:** Flexible borders. Not open borders. **Jack Altman:** Let's cut that thing. **Roelof Botha:** I'm just kidding. We can keep that.
[00:47:09] **Jack Altman:** There's company that are like that too, which presents an interesting problem, which is conflicts
[00:47:14] that the founder feels that the VC doesn't feel. You know, company thinks that a space that they're
[00:47:19] not in today is one that they may or may not be in the future and they'd really prefer that you
[00:47:23] don't stamp, you know, the nice green Sequoia logo on that company because it might be on the road
[00:47:29] map in a few years. Please don't do it. What do you say? Like, how do you handle this situation?
[00:47:33] Because I think like, um, I think going back to limiting factors for venture skill,
[00:47:38] conflicts present another one, which is when you're deep enough with the founder, it is feels
[00:47:42] treasonous to invest in a competitor, but those borders are fuzzy when companies are empires.
[00:47:48] **Roelof Botha:** And I think we at Sequoia have a distinct challenge when it comes to this because we're your
[00:47:53] business partner. I think if, um, I think sometimes if you're an early seed investor, uh, I think
[00:47:59] seed investors can maybe invest in several companies in a category. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** Uh, so can the super
[00:48:04] growth investors, so can the super growth investors because they're often on taking board seats and
[00:48:08] not involved with helping with the strategic guidance of a company. And so I think it's, it's a
[00:48:12] firm like ours. It's in the middle where we really are your business partner of choice.
[00:48:15] **Jack Altman:** Mm hmm. **Roelof Botha:** Where, but you've chosen me and, you know, I'm, you know, you are the my thought partner
[00:48:22] to help me figure out how to achieve well dominance. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** Exactly. I don't want to share you with
[00:48:26] anybody else. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** So we feel that pain probably more than most. Um, in some situations, we've
[00:48:31] invested in companies that supposedly became competitive. So we invested very early in both
[00:48:35] Stripe and Square. Uh, and so, you know, John and Patrick at Stripe, at some point realized that
[00:48:41] they had ambitions to move into spaces that Square was competing in and Jack over time realized
[00:48:47] that he wanted to compete in some areas that were Stripe is competitive in. I think
[00:48:50] candidly the companies have more in common and can work together very well. And yeah, uh,
[00:48:55] I've introduced them to each other and I think there's more partnership opportunity now, but there
[00:48:59] was a time where the two viewed each other as competitive. And so when John and Patrick would give
[00:49:04] the partnership an update, I would actually not join the meeting. **Jack Altman:** Mm hmm. **Roelof Botha:** And I was not allowed to read
[00:49:08] the investment memo. And I, in our internal systems, I actually couldn't access any of the
[00:49:12] information about Stripe because we wanted to make sure that we've reserved the sanctity of
[00:49:16] their information distinct from anybody who was working with who they deemed to be a competitor.
[00:49:20] So sometimes it happens that, you know, **Jack Altman:** yeah, subsequent to our investment, because we were early
[00:49:26] investors in both, they converge. So this happens to us frequently. I think the real challenge is
[00:49:31] they can, **Roelof Botha:** at entry point. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. Cause the convergence is like, no, I mean, like, yeah, sort of,
[00:49:36] you know, it happens subsequently. **Roelof Botha:** And what do you do when it's a very mature company that has
[00:49:41] an ambition on a space? And those companies often have 17 ambitions going at once, you know,
[00:49:46] that look adjacent to them when they get to a certain size. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** So I mean, it comes down to a
[00:49:51] conversation and having, you know, is this really in your bull's eye? Or is this an adjacency
[00:49:57] in an option value? Because by the way, often if we don't invest, somebody else is probably going
[00:50:01] to invest in this company. And so, you know, you're going to deal with them as a competitive issue.
[00:50:06] And so we want to have a conversation with our closest business partners to really understand,
[00:50:10] is this really one of your top five issues? **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** Or is this a peripheral issue that you can live with?
[00:50:15] **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** And it's a conversation because we're in a relationship business with our founders. So
[00:50:20] sometimes we do walk away from investments for competitive reasons. **Jack Altman:** And I guess it's probably a
[00:50:23] judgment call about how deep is the partnership? How much do you agree or disagree with the founder?
[00:50:28] How upset are they? And you basically just have to make these ongoing business judgment calls?
[00:50:33] **Roelof Botha:** Yes. But that's sort of we could pay to do. We're into judgment. **Jack Altman:** One of many things.
[00:50:38] I want to talk about a couple of the sort of areas around AI. I want to start with robotics.
[00:50:44] It seems to me that it really ought to work. A couple of the podcast guests I've had have sort of
[00:50:50] walked out, you know, like Vinod Koso, for example, have like walked out these articulations where
[00:50:54] I left being like, this is the next trillion dollar market for sure. I'm curious where you think
[00:50:58] about a market like that where it seemed like it could be a, you know, expensive ubiquitous,
[00:51:04] completely new type of product. How much can you spend on something like that?
[00:51:08] **Roelof Botha:** Very, and I agree on many things. We've worked on a few companies together. And on this one,
[00:51:16] I agree with him too. I'm very optimistic about the future of robotics. Some of that is enabled by
[00:51:21] AI. You know, we made an early investment in Deepak and Abhinav, who the founders of skilled,
[00:51:26] they're building a foundation model for robotics out of CMU. And it's incredible to see what they're
[00:51:31] able to do with commodity hardware. And infusing it with the knowledge and the systems that they have,
[00:51:38] you get these off the shelf robots that are imbued with the ability to just walk stairs, climb stairs,
[00:51:43] navigate new environments that never seen open doors, do dishes, you know, do house cleaning work,
[00:51:49] all the sort of things you'd expect from a future of robotics. So whether it's that,
[00:51:54] Roman, who's the founder of Robco in Germany, you know, he's building automation for, you know,
[00:51:59] small, medium-sized enterprises, often they're struggling to hire people. And so robotics is a
[00:52:04] fantastic solution for them. I now have two examples, like immediate recent examples in our portfolio,
[00:52:09] where we partnered early with these founders. And I'm seeing the results. You know,
[00:52:12] co-bodies another example, Brad Porter, who built most of the robotics at Amazon. We're back
[00:52:17] that company. They're seeing traction with their business too. **Jack Altman:** Is it like self-driving cars,
[00:52:22] where like there's going to be, you know, some large number of years between, oh my goodness,
[00:52:26] the tech works to like, oh wow, we're, what, riding waymos around, like are we? Is it that kind of ramp?
[00:52:31] **Roelof Botha:** No, I think it's a little bit different. The challenge with autonomous vehicles is the risk of
[00:52:37] fatalities, which is part of why we don't see waymos on freeways just yet. The challenge
[00:52:43] in robotics is a little different. Most of robotics until recently, I mean, obviously robotics
[00:52:46] is a massive, massive industry, but they're typically very large machines that are relatively
[00:52:50] dangerous and they're cordoned off for humans. I don't know if you've visited a Tesla factory,
[00:52:54] it was actually, when I bought my first Tesla it was such a fun thing to go see the Tesla factory
[00:52:58] and you see all these robots. Oh, this is so cool. But because of the risk of harm to humans,
[00:53:02] they had to be kept separate. I think the beauty of this age is when you get computer vision
[00:53:07] in these robots and they can interact with us in our normal environment. That unlocks so much
[00:53:12] more possibility. And if you can get them into a form factor that is not likely to cause human harm,
[00:53:18] I just think it unlocks possibilities. Look at some level where we already have robots. I mean,
[00:53:21] you have rumors running around cleaning floors and things like that. I mean, at a small scale,
[00:53:24] where we have some of the building, I think we're in a stair step our way into this.
[00:53:29] **Jack Altman:** I mean, if it gets to something generalizable in the home, it should be truly enormous, I would think.
[00:53:33] **Roelof Botha:** You're right about that, but both skilled and Robco, well, all three of them, skilled Robco,
[00:53:39] all of them have revenue today, actually serving customers in a variety of different use cases,
[00:53:45] whether it's hospital systems, whether it's airport security, whether it's small manufacturing
[00:53:50] firms that need robotic assistance to help them scale. All these companies have revenue. They're
[00:53:54] actually up and running today. And so I don't think this is a lab experiment where you see the demos,
[00:54:00] but who knows if it's real? **Jack Altman:** Like it works just has to get everywhere. **Roelof Botha:** It works. And it's slowly
[00:54:04] progressing into more and more areas where the cost benefit of it makes sense. A lot of it comes
[00:54:08] down to the cost of human labor, by the way. Part of the reason Japan has robotized so much more
[00:54:13] than other countries is because the cost of labor got very high. It's had made economic
[00:54:18] sense for them to do so. **Jack Altman:** That should be the case here too, I suppose. **Roelof Botha:** And that's part of what's
[00:54:21] changing is the cost of labor in America is changing and that necessitates that. If you think about
[00:54:25] the way that minimum wages have gone for the restaurant industry in California, for example,
[00:54:30] it's driving many more restaurant chains in California to try to figure out solutions for automation
[00:54:35] because otherwise the business models don't work anymore. **Jack Altman:** It's actually one of the favorite books I
[00:54:38] read the summer was how economics explains the history of the world. And it's just because you
[00:54:44] invent something doesn't mean it'll be applied. It needs an economic driver. And I think that's
[00:54:48] precisely what's happening now with robotics. **Roelof Botha:** We're back to costs. **Jack Altman:** Exactly. **Roelof Botha:** Other than robotics,
[00:54:54] what are some of the other big societal level things, whether it's education or government or
[00:55:02] healthcare? What are other big, big areas that you think outside of business applications that AI
[00:55:09] you think is going to matter a lot in the next few years? **Jack Altman:** Healthcare is one, I'm enamored with
[00:55:14] in particular genetics, sequence, you know, 25 years ago. It's actually the 25th celebration of
[00:55:22] that. That was an enormous research initiative to get to that point. By the way, the cost of sequencing
[00:55:27] the genome follows one of these phenomenal cost curves. If you've ever seen these plots, it's
[00:55:32] actually faster than Moore's law and how the cost of sequencing has dropped dramatically. And that's
[00:55:37] open up so many more possibilities for us, whether it's pre-nettle screening, which is basically
[00:55:42] ubiquitous now in America, whether it's helping do oncology screening, organ transplant rejection
[00:55:48] screening, newborn analysis. One of my friends at Stanford in the genetics department has got
[00:55:54] this technology to be able to do a whole genome sequence. He developed originally for the NICU
[00:55:59] unit at Stanford where they can sequence a full human genome in hours because they have these
[00:56:04] babies where you need to understand the genetics very quickly to make clinical decisions that are
[00:56:10] life saving. And so I think about all these possibilities around the field of genetics,
[00:56:14] they're incredibly powerful. And that's a dividend we keep on benefiting from as that cost
[00:56:19] curve rides down. So I think genetics is super interesting. And then I think about AI, by the way,
[00:56:25] in the healthcare industry, either you know, we only have about a million physicians in America.
[00:56:29] **Roelof Botha:** It's stunning. **Jack Altman:** It's not an any. **Roelof Botha:** And we have got a population of roughly 350 million. We only have
[00:56:33] a million physicians. What can we do to make them more productive? Partly by giving them tools.
[00:56:38] So, you know, we partnered early with Daniel at Open Evidence. That company's not being used by some
[00:56:44] like 40% of American physicians. **Jack Altman:** Which is great because by the way, like you speak to physicians
[00:56:48] who have been doing it for a while or you speak to a new one, it like seems clear that like a
[00:56:53] a newly minted doctor today is like exhausted and overworked. And there's like too many patients. And
[00:56:58] like they're rushing through things and they're documenting and the patient experience changes.
[00:57:01] So I don't know why it seems somehow different. I don't know if the ratio has changed or something
[00:57:05] else changed, but it seems like if you talk to older doctors, like something's different.
[00:57:10] **Roelof Botha:** Well, I think the burden, the ratio of patient to physician has changed because I don't think we're
[00:57:15] we're not creating this but we're not the right word. We're not educating as many physicians
[00:57:19] as we need to support the level of population we have. So the burden position has increased.
[00:57:24] So we need tools to help physicians make better decisions, but it also need to leave
[00:57:28] their administrative burden. So, you know, the US healthcare industry is something I think it's
[00:57:33] 16, 70% of US GDP is spent on healthcare. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** Roughly one in five dollars in health
[00:57:38] tourists for the administration of healthcare. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** So if you think about that, it's almost a
[00:57:42] trillion dollars a year. **Jack Altman:** I mean, they're typing in Epic a lot. **Roelof Botha:** So, you know, we have a company called
[00:57:46] Freed is helping with automating the workflow for a physician. So it's not helping with a clinical
[00:57:51] decision making the way that open evidence is, but Freed is helping just automate the workflows.
[00:57:57] How do you take a dictation of the patient visit and automatically understand how to write the record
[00:58:03] what is the follow-up appointments that need to be scheduled where the referrals you need,
[00:58:06] what are the prescriptions to follow-up. And if you can save a physician an hour or two a day
[00:58:10] of admin work, I mean, that is pretty dramatic and they they day-to-day lives. **Jack Altman:** Yeah. **Roelof Botha:** Are there
[00:58:15] any other areas in particular outside of the robotics, healthcare? Are there any other like
[00:58:20] societally important things that have you like particularly animated? **Jack Altman:** This may sound cold,
[00:58:25] but I think money. **Roelof Botha:** What's cold about that? **Jack Altman:** Yeah. You know, sometimes people feel that money is
[00:58:32] dirty or whatever. I think, you know, at the end of the day, commerce and capitalism has been the
[00:58:37] financial system. The financial system is the biggest boon to human welfare. And when we
[00:58:44] improve the efficiency of the commerce system, I think it has massive societal benefits.
[00:58:51] And one of those in my mind is stablecoins. And the way that we are using stablecoins to rewire
[00:58:56] our financial infrastructure, a lot of our systems were built decades ago with what was the best
[00:59:01] technology at the time, but it's dated. And it's slow. And so we have this ability to use
[00:59:05] stablecoins to reinvent that. And Stripes are one of the companies at the forefront of this with
[00:59:10] some of what they've developed. They also bought a company called Bridge that we were an early
[00:59:13] investor in. And Bridge is being used for international transfers. I mentioned this company
[00:59:17] at Spora, they're helping at a consumer level with international transfers. And so I think there's
[00:59:22] a really interesting possibility for us to completely change our financial system and make it
[00:59:26] far more efficient, ultimately for businesses and for consumers. **Roelof Botha:** As a final sort of topic,
[00:59:31] what I wanted to ask you about was your team and how you think about building the team, the
[00:59:35] composition, who you want to attract, what values and activities you want to sort of promote
[00:59:42] or dissuade. My first guest on Uncapped was Sean McGuire, who I love. I think he's awesome.
[00:59:47] And he's also like a polarizing figure. He says a lot of stuff online that I'm like,
[00:59:52] go Sean, a lot of people are frustrated. And on first glance, it could seem like Sequoia is this
[00:59:58] extremely professional, not like overly sort of bombastic place. But Sean says what he feels
[01:00:06] online and is an important member of the firm and is a great investor. And so I guess my first
[01:00:12] question is, is that a sort of tolerated edge of the center of Sequoia's culture or is that in
[01:00:19] some ways like the heart of it? **Jack Altman:** I think it's the heart of it. And it actually goes back all the way
[01:00:24] to Don and his own streak of irreverence. Don told me a story when I joined where he was going
[01:00:30] from interviewed IBM. And he was sitting in the waiting room for this interview and he noticed
[01:00:35] how everybody was wearing the same Navy blazer. And he just thought, wow, this is a place of conformity.
[01:00:40] And he realized then that he needed to move to the west coast and break out on his own. And I think
[01:00:45] that streak of irreverence actually runs very deep in Sequoia. It's part of why Don backed the
[01:00:50] sort of founders he did. When he backed Steve Jobs, who at the time I believe wasn't wearing shoes
[01:00:54] and maybe it just come back from a
