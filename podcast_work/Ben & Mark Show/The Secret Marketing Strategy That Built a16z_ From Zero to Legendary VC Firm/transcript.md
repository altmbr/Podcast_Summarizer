[00:00:00] I cause a lot of antagonism between us and the other firms and mouth stays.
[00:00:03] Ben Horowitz: Your filter is like, you're gonna get the deal or I'm gonna get the deal.
[00:00:07] Margit Wennmachers: You die or I die.
[00:00:08] Margit Wennmachers: And they're not exactly shrinking about what's themselves.
[00:00:10] Ben Horowitz: They hated that cover story.
[00:00:12] Ben Horowitz: Like it in one of the cover of the magazine.
[00:00:14] Ben Horowitz: That's not supposed to be him.
[00:00:16] Ben Horowitz: Not supposed to be the entrepreneur.
[00:00:18] Ben Horowitz: With the hell that it is.
[00:00:19] Ben Horowitz: I mean, they just like,
[00:00:21] Ben Horowitz: what's the reason we didn't have any reverse for the stuff.
[00:00:23] Ben Horowitz: Yeah, it is.
[00:00:25] Ben Horowitz: The C was like a big secret.
[00:00:27] Ben Horowitz: And then actually building companies was a big secret.
[00:00:30] Ben Horowitz: And so just kind of talking about it was a big differentiator.
[00:00:33] Ben Horowitz: We don't have products.
[00:00:34] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah, and we have products.
[00:00:36] Ben Horowitz: We have people and ideas. That's it.
[00:00:43] All right, welcome to the A16C.
[00:00:46] Ben Horowitz: What are we on?
[00:00:47] Ben Horowitz: The Mark and Ben show.
[00:00:47] Ben Horowitz: Welcome to the Mark and Ben show.
[00:00:50] Today we've got Mark and Gwen Markers, the legendary head of marketing for
[00:00:56] Ben Horowitz: A16Z for the last 16 years.
[00:00:59] Ben Horowitz: And she is going to tell us the story of all that.
[00:01:04] Ben Horowitz: You've heard snippets of it from me and Mark over the years.
[00:01:07] Ben Horowitz: But now we're going to hear the real thing from the real person market.
[00:01:10] Ben Horowitz: Welcome.
[00:01:11] Ben Horowitz: Thank you so much for having me, guys.
[00:01:12] Margit Wennmachers: I'm thrilled to be here.
[00:01:14] Margit Wennmachers: But between the legendary and the 15 or 16, I feel kind of anxious.
[00:01:17] Margit Wennmachers: Why?
[00:01:18] Margit Wennmachers: Why?
[00:01:19] Margit Wennmachers: Why?
[00:01:20] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:01:21] Ben Horowitz: No, it's getting us all.
[00:01:22] Ben Horowitz: It's very rough.
[00:01:24] Ben Horowitz: I know.
[00:01:24] Ben Horowitz: It just a bitch that way.
[00:01:26] So maybe we can start with just like when we met.
[00:01:30] Ben Horowitz: Maybe I'd love to hear it from your perspective.
[00:01:33] Ben Horowitz: OK.
[00:01:33] Ben Horowitz: So we're here.
[00:01:34] Ben Horowitz: Hobies or I think we're going to be sort of the stats.
[00:01:37] Ben Horowitz: The creamery.
[00:01:37] Ben Horowitz: The creamery.
[00:01:38] Ben Horowitz: The creamery.
[00:01:39] Ben Horowitz: That one was your off.
[00:01:41] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:01:42] Ben Horowitz: And so I, I forgot the firm started at the creamery.
[00:01:47] Ben Horowitz: That's right.
[00:01:47] Ben Horowitz: Right.
[00:01:48] Margit Wennmachers: Exactly.
[00:01:48] Margit Wennmachers: So I was, a certain someone who shall go nameless, tried to hire outcast.
[00:01:55] Margit Wennmachers: And Facebook invoked a conflict of interest.
[00:01:58] Margit Wennmachers: You know exactly who that is, right?
[00:02:00] Margit Wennmachers: And so that certain someone called Mark and said,
[00:02:03] Margit Wennmachers: just call Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:02:04] Margit Wennmachers: And I think you had better things to do
[00:02:05] Margit Wennmachers: than like pull a favor from Mark Zuckerberg to go like,
[00:02:07] Margit Wennmachers: why don't you like this, whatever.
[00:02:10] Margit Wennmachers: Anyhow.
[00:02:10] Margit Wennmachers: But I think you asked for my email address.
[00:02:12] Margit Wennmachers: And so that's how we were introduced.
[00:02:16] Ben Horowitz: And then I was told to go to the creamery, the waiter,
[00:02:19] Margit Wennmachers: at the creamery.
[00:02:20] Margit Wennmachers: He's like, go be here.
[00:02:22] Margit Wennmachers: They're meeting with some democratic functionaries.
[00:02:24] Margit Wennmachers: Or something like that.
[00:02:26] Margit Wennmachers: So I went there with my little capabilities presentation.
[00:02:30] Margit Wennmachers: And I had met you like years before, but like at no recollection,
[00:02:34] Margit Wennmachers: I had not met you.
[00:02:35] Margit Wennmachers: I'd heard about you a little bit.
[00:02:36] Margit Wennmachers: So I go there with my capabilities presentation.
[00:02:39] Margit Wennmachers: I sit down, the Democrats left, the booth.
[00:02:42] Margit Wennmachers: And I sit down.
[00:02:43] Margit Wennmachers: You basically were just looking straight ahead.
[00:02:46] Margit Wennmachers: You were just like, I don't know what you were thinking about,
[00:02:49] Margit Wennmachers: but it was not that.
[00:02:50] Ben Horowitz: Probably how we get the firm off of.
[00:02:52] Ben Horowitz: We raise some money.
[00:02:54] Ben Horowitz: And then Mark grabs the, like you grabbed the capabilities
[00:02:58] Margit Wennmachers: presentation, which was generic, because I had no idea why I was there.
[00:03:01] Margit Wennmachers: So and you go, like, OK, so how do you pick the clients?
[00:03:04] Margit Wennmachers: And you're the clients?
[00:03:04] Margit Wennmachers: And why those clients are not these clients?
[00:03:06] Margit Wennmachers: And like teams, whatever, like detailed questions.
[00:03:09] Margit Wennmachers: So I got this little grueling.
[00:03:10] Margit Wennmachers: And then you both said, thank you.
[00:03:12] Margit Wennmachers: And I left.
[00:03:13] And I concluded that it was proud because you were angel investing
[00:03:17] Margit Wennmachers: at the time.
[00:03:17] Margit Wennmachers: And you had just left HP.
[00:03:19] Margit Wennmachers: I was like, maybe they just want to have somebody
[00:03:21] Margit Wennmachers: they can recommend to their angel portfolio.
[00:03:24] Margit Wennmachers: But I'm right.
[00:03:25] Margit Wennmachers: And then a few months later, we met at the Rosewood.
[00:03:28] Margit Wennmachers: I think, no, it was not the Rosewood.
[00:03:31] Margit Wennmachers: We were there a lot.
[00:03:32] Marc Andreessen: So anyhow.
[00:03:33] Marc Andreessen: And then you guys meant, OK, so we're going to start this firm.
[00:03:37] Margit Wennmachers: And top secret blah, blah, blah.
[00:03:39] Margit Wennmachers: I'm going to start this firm.
[00:03:40] Margit Wennmachers: And it's going to be the two of us $300 million.
[00:03:43] Margit Wennmachers: And this is at a certain time where money was kind of tight.
[00:03:46] Margit Wennmachers: It's a number.
[00:03:48] Margit Wennmachers: At the end of the world.
[00:03:49] Marc Andreessen: Right.
[00:03:50] Marc Andreessen: There was no liquidity.
[00:03:51] Margit Wennmachers: The last end of the world.
[00:03:52] Marc Andreessen: And I looked at a little critical.
[00:03:54] Margit Wennmachers: And I said, it's not a great time.
[00:03:56] Margit Wennmachers: And you said, Mark said, let's assume success shall we?
[00:04:00] Margit Wennmachers: And then you had already had the idea of, well,
[00:04:04] Margit Wennmachers: we wanted to say something.
[00:04:06] Margit Wennmachers: But we couldn't be out talking to press
[00:04:09] Margit Wennmachers: or be on Twitter at the time or whatever else and raise money.
[00:04:13] Margit Wennmachers: We used to do a soliciting month.
[00:04:15] Margit Wennmachers: So Mark then went.
[00:04:18] Margit Wennmachers: He had a standing invitation, I think, on Charlie Rose.
[00:04:21] Margit Wennmachers: And you went on Charlie Rose.
[00:04:22] Margit Wennmachers: And you had a nice, very nice chat at the very end.
[00:04:25] Margit Wennmachers: Just like, well, by the way, we're going to start to be see-for.
[00:04:28] Margit Wennmachers: And then we all went quiet.
[00:04:30] Margit Wennmachers: So that was that.
[00:04:31] Margit Wennmachers: That's my recollection.
[00:04:32] Margit Wennmachers: I don't know what you guys said.
[00:04:33] Margit Wennmachers: I remember thinking, yeah, I was just so distracted
[00:04:36] Ben Horowitz: with how do we raise money?
[00:04:41] Ben Horowitz: Like we had never met LPs tell them.
[00:04:45] Ben Horowitz: And then we, every VC that we had been meeting with.
[00:04:49] Ben Horowitz: And we, at the same time, were meeting with lots and lots of VCs
[00:04:53] Ben Horowitz: trying to understand the industry.
[00:04:55] Ben Horowitz: And they all said, that's a dumbass idea for a fund.
[00:05:01] Ben Horowitz: You should definitely not do it.
[00:05:04] Ben Horowitz: They just wanted to give you jobs.
[00:05:05] Margit Wennmachers: I'm assuming.
[00:05:07] Ben Horowitz: Yeah, well, they were like, well, one of them said that we should just do,
[00:05:12] Ben Horowitz: like we'd never raise it from the LPs.
[00:05:14] Ben Horowitz: So we should just raise the money from VCs and give the VCs
[00:05:17] Ben Horowitz: who invested half the carry.
[00:05:19] Ben Horowitz: That was kind of.
[00:05:20] Ben Horowitz: Interesting.
[00:05:21] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:05:22] Ben Horowitz: That was one strategy.
[00:05:23] Ben Horowitz: And then the whole platform thing, that was really dumb
[00:05:27] Ben Horowitz: because it had been tried before and proven like proven like,
[00:05:32] Ben Horowitz: QED that it could never work.
[00:05:35] Ben Horowitz: Actually, who tried it for real?
[00:05:38] I don't know.
[00:05:39] Ben Horowitz: So I think the main thing that they were thinking about was the incubators.
[00:05:42] Marc Andreessen: Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:43] Marc Andreessen: So I think it was the sort of the Belgrés.
[00:05:45] Marc Andreessen: It was the late 90s, exactly.
[00:05:46] Marc Andreessen: And you actually in retrospect, like, it's actually very, very,
[00:05:48] Marc Andreessen: like, so this is kind of the real big, gross idea lab.
[00:05:52] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:05:53] Marc Andreessen: So this is Gibater created, I think a lot of companies.
[00:05:54] Marc Andreessen: I mean, among the companies you created turn out to be a company
[00:05:55] Marc Andreessen: that created basically the Google search model.
[00:05:58] Marc Andreessen: And so as well as like a bunch of other super interesting companies.
[00:06:01] Marc Andreessen: So I think those, those actually works,
[00:06:02] Marc Andreessen: the good ones work better than people remember.
[00:06:04] Marc Andreessen: But yeah, they specifically, and the incubators in those days
[00:06:08] Marc Andreessen: went for like a 50% equity split, right?
[00:06:11] Marc Andreessen: This contrast to the like Y-combinator, which is famously like 7%.
[00:06:15] Marc Andreessen: And so to justify the 50%, they provided office space
[00:06:19] Marc Andreessen: and you're telling services and your legal services.
[00:06:22] Marc Andreessen: And so, right, exactly.
[00:06:23] Marc Andreessen: And we had been entrepreneurs.
[00:06:27] Marc Andreessen: And so we just had a very different perspective
[00:06:28] Marc Andreessen: on what we actually needed from our entrepreneurs.
[00:06:30] Marc Andreessen: And so we just had a very different view
[00:06:32] Marc Andreessen: than the incubators had.
[00:06:33] And then the existing BCs just, yeah, for whatever reason,
[00:06:35] Marc Andreessen: couldn't put themselves in that.
[00:06:37] Marc Andreessen: And then I think because they hadn't been entrepreneurs.
[00:06:38] Marc Andreessen: They hadn't been customers of the VC product.
[00:06:41] Ben Horowitz: So they weren't looking at it through that lens.
[00:06:43] Ben Horowitz: They were looking at it from the provider.
[00:06:46] And by the way, those businesses were all great businesses.
[00:06:50] Ben Horowitz: So they sort of earned the right to be arrogant in that sense.
[00:06:54] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:06:55] And I remember the Bill Gross, when he was talking,
[00:06:59] Margit Wennmachers: and I met him, it was all like, OK, I have all these ideas.
[00:07:02] Margit Wennmachers: Well, that was also that, right?
[00:07:03] Margit Wennmachers: And there was that.
[00:07:04] Margit Wennmachers: A higher-go-her, not a career.
[00:07:05] Margit Wennmachers: You guys had come from a completely different lens.
[00:07:08] Margit Wennmachers: And we had the ideas and believed that Larry Ellis.
[00:07:10] Margit Wennmachers: And those people had the ideas, not the financial machinery.
[00:07:15] Margit Wennmachers: And then obviously, you had absorbed Overt's playbook.
[00:07:19] Margit Wennmachers: So it's a very different version of a platform
[00:07:22] Margit Wennmachers: from an in-cubator.
[00:07:24] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:07:25] Marc Andreessen: And as you know, basically, when we had to find a historical model
[00:07:28] Marc Andreessen: for what we were doing, it turned out to be a CAA.
[00:07:30] Marc Andreessen: Because that just mapped much more to what we had in mind.
[00:07:33] Marc Andreessen: Because they hadn't been a precedent
[00:07:35] Marc Andreessen: like that applied in the Valley.
[00:07:36] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:07:37] Ben Horowitz: And at that time, there was before Overt's book came out.
[00:07:41] Ben Horowitz: So that whole strategy was basically a secret.
[00:07:44] Ben Horowitz: Nobody knew it.
[00:07:45] Ben Horowitz: Like, you had to know Overt's to know it.
[00:07:48] Ben Horowitz: And Overt's was very secretive.
[00:07:52] Ben Horowitz: You know, we had several conversations
[00:07:55] Ben Horowitz: before we could actually get it out of him, even
[00:07:57] Ben Horowitz: who was out of CAA for many years.
[00:07:59] Ben Horowitz: You know, it was like a very secret formula
[00:08:03] Ben Horowitz: he had come up with.
[00:08:04] Ben Horowitz: And it was an amazing thing.
[00:08:06] Ben Horowitz: But it ended up being a genius thing to have him on your board.
[00:08:09] Margit Wennmachers: Like, it was a very unorthodox pick,
[00:08:12] Margit Wennmachers: like looking in from the outside.
[00:08:14] Margit Wennmachers: And it led to all kinds of useful connections
[00:08:17] Margit Wennmachers: and useful thinking, right?
[00:08:19] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:08:21] Ben Horowitz: It was controversial at the time, even a much stronger
[00:08:23] Ben Horowitz: on board, I wasn't even named.
[00:08:24] Ben Horowitz: But it was different to have him.
[00:08:28] Ben Horowitz: We actually met him through Ron Conway, right?
[00:08:30] Ben Horowitz: Years ago.
[00:08:31] Ben Horowitz: The human router of all time.
[00:08:33] Ben Horowitz: The human router, yeah.
[00:08:34] Ben Horowitz: Great.
[00:08:35] Ben Horowitz: That was a great intro from Ron.
[00:08:37] Ben Horowitz: And yeah, what an interesting friendship that's been.
[00:08:41] Ben Horowitz: So the next thing that happened, so then we're going to raise
[00:08:45] Ben Horowitz: the money and we decide that we're going to talk to the press,
[00:08:51] Ben Horowitz: which was very different for VCs to actually be aggressive
[00:08:54] Ben Horowitz: about that.
[00:08:55] Ben Horowitz: Usually the VCs would want to talk to the press
[00:08:58] Margit Wennmachers: and some of them had been clients at the IPO time.
[00:09:02] Margit Wennmachers: So they wanted to basically have no risk.
[00:09:04] Margit Wennmachers: But then when the company goes,
[00:09:05] Margit Wennmachers: public is like, hey, I did that.
[00:09:07] Margit Wennmachers: So we did it backwards, if you will.
[00:09:10] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah, yeah, right.
[00:09:12] Ben Horowitz: With nothing in hand, we just went for it.
[00:09:15] Ben Horowitz: So as soon as we raised the fund, was it, yeah,
[00:09:19] Ben Horowitz: we must have had to raise the fund to do the press tour
[00:09:22] Ben Horowitz: because they're kind of jumping out.
[00:09:23] Ben Horowitz: And so how did you think about it?
[00:09:27] Ben Horowitz: I guess it was very magical from our point of view
[00:09:31] Ben Horowitz: other than when Wired slammed the door on my face.
[00:09:34] Ben Horowitz: But.
[00:09:36] Ben Horowitz: Well, that was a huge signal.
[00:09:38] Ben Horowitz: We realized, oh, we have to, we have to even the plague
[00:09:41] Margit Wennmachers: feel a little bit here a little bit.
[00:09:42] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah, that was a little bit of a problem.
[00:09:44] Ben Horowitz: So tell us it.
[00:09:46] Ben Horowitz: Tell us about that.
[00:09:47] Ben Horowitz: So the way I used to think about this when
[00:09:50] Margit Wennmachers: this was all working so magically is that, OK,
[00:09:52] Margit Wennmachers: so if you read any article and you just dissect the headline,
[00:09:57] the paragraphs, like how it unfolds.
[00:10:00] Margit Wennmachers: And then so you take a client like you guys or a product
[00:10:03] Margit Wennmachers: company, you go, OK, how do I fill that?
[00:10:06] Margit Wennmachers: How do I write that story from a reporter's point of view?
[00:10:09] Margit Wennmachers: And like, you actually have it, right?
[00:10:11] Margit Wennmachers: And so if the story is like $300 million and two people
[00:10:15] Margit Wennmachers: have never actually done this before,
[00:10:17] Margit Wennmachers: that's not a great story.
[00:10:19] Margit Wennmachers: But we did have the column inches to fill, if you will,
[00:10:22] Margit Wennmachers: because you had the idea for the platform, right?
[00:10:26] Margit Wennmachers: You had been proven successful entrepreneurs.
[00:10:30] Margit Wennmachers: You had credibility with the core audience, right?
[00:10:32] Margit Wennmachers: And taking a step back, the thing that we all decided
[00:10:35] Margit Wennmachers: is like, we're just going to aim all of our communications
[00:10:39] Margit Wennmachers: at the entrepreneurs, at the entrepreneurs versus the LPs.
[00:10:42] Margit Wennmachers: Because we have their numbers.
[00:10:43] Margit Wennmachers: We're not a column.
[00:10:44] Margit Wennmachers: And you guys got great introductions to people.
[00:10:47] Margit Wennmachers: It all needs to be very entrepreneur friendly.
[00:10:48] Margit Wennmachers: And so we sort of set out like we have this platform.
[00:10:51] Margit Wennmachers: And it's all in service of the entrepreneur who
[00:10:54] Margit Wennmachers: is the genius, if the, and then hopefully the idea works.
[00:10:58] Margit Wennmachers: And then how can we add value?
[00:11:01] Margit Wennmachers: And that was different enough to me, having met,
[00:11:04] Margit Wennmachers: like most of all the other VCs.
[00:11:06] Margit Wennmachers: And then, you know, the tall guy over here
[00:11:09] Margit Wennmachers: had co-created the browser.
[00:11:11] Margit Wennmachers: So that was not a VC credential.
[00:11:14] Margit Wennmachers: But it was an incredible entrepreneur credential, right?
[00:11:17] Margit Wennmachers: Like so, you know, and then you,
[00:11:22] that the turnaround, like the save of all time,
[00:11:24] Margit Wennmachers: I mean, I have not so good with sports analogies,
[00:11:26] Margit Wennmachers: but there's gotta be 17 in there, right?
[00:11:29] Margit Wennmachers: Like having turned that around, and it's older to HP.
[00:11:32] Margit Wennmachers: And like for like money, money, it was just spectacular.
[00:11:35] Margit Wennmachers: So I think the two people who were behind it
[00:11:39] Margit Wennmachers: who were very entrepreneur friendly,
[00:11:41] Margit Wennmachers: they had really good credentials,
[00:11:43] Margit Wennmachers: both on the tech side and a category creation side.
[00:11:46] Margit Wennmachers: And on the sort of like how does one execute
[00:11:48] Margit Wennmachers: one of those companies?
[00:11:50] And then you had the money.
[00:11:51] Margit Wennmachers: And you had the money at a time when there was no money.
[00:11:55] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:11:55] Margit Wennmachers: There was nobody really raising,
[00:11:57] Margit Wennmachers: and like the other people that could just sit and wake,
[00:11:59] Margit Wennmachers: right, until times got better.
[00:12:00] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:12:01] Margit Wennmachers: And then I think, if I remember correctly,
[00:12:04] Margit Wennmachers: you had done it in three months,
[00:12:05] Margit Wennmachers: which at the time seemed very spectacular
[00:12:08] Margit Wennmachers: because there was no money.
[00:12:09] Margit Wennmachers: So I could then pitch in, like, okay,
[00:12:11] Margit Wennmachers: like it's those two guys and it did in three months
[00:12:14] Margit Wennmachers: and have you read the news.
[00:12:15] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:12:16] Margit Wennmachers: And then they have all these ideas.
[00:12:17] Margit Wennmachers: Well, actually one of the funny things
[00:12:19] Ben Horowitz: that happened while we were raising money,
[00:12:20] Ben Horowitz: that upset Mark, what upset me?
[00:12:23] Ben Horowitz: Because I just thought it was weird,
[00:12:24] Ben Horowitz: but we went to see an LP who we knew.
[00:12:29] Ben Horowitz: And the LP blocks into the meeting.
[00:12:33] Ben Horowitz: And here we are, like, you know,
[00:12:34] Ben Horowitz: and it really kind of brought us back
[00:12:36] Ben Horowitz: to raising money in general,
[00:12:37] Ben Horowitz: which is a good kind of thing to go through
[00:12:40] Ben Horowitz: if you're going to be investing in companies,
[00:12:43] Ben Horowitz: because you need to know what that feels like.
[00:12:45] Ben Horowitz: So, you know, we're practicing the pitch
[00:12:48] Ben Horowitz: where you got it all lined up.
[00:12:50] Ben Horowitz: We're like, okay, this is a big meeting.
[00:12:51] Ben Horowitz: It's a big LP.
[00:12:53] Ben Horowitz: And we go in and the guy comes in and he goes,
[00:12:56] oh yeah, you know, yeah, this, I, I, I, I, you know,
[00:13:01] Ben Horowitz: I hear what you guys are doing.
[00:13:02] Ben Horowitz: I think, you know, at best you could raise it in 18 months,
[00:13:06] Ben Horowitz: but it'll be very hard, but I got to go.
[00:13:07] Ben Horowitz: I'm going to go talk to some ex-entive-fell players.
[00:13:10] Ben Horowitz: Who?
[00:13:11] Right there.
[00:13:12] Go, go.
[00:13:13] Marc Andreessen: I have to go over to Stanford to talk to a roomful
[00:13:15] Marc Andreessen: of NFL players and how to manage their money.
[00:13:17] Marc Andreessen: And then they're, they're, they're,
[00:13:18] Marc Andreessen: they're NFL careers are over.
[00:13:19] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:13:20] Marc Andreessen: Like that was the, that was the thing
[00:13:21] Marc Andreessen: that was more important than talking to us,
[00:13:23] Marc Andreessen: which was a very, yeah, that was a level setting experience.
[00:13:26] Yeah, we were like, that was extremely motivated.
[00:13:28] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:13:29] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:13:30] Ben Horowitz: As you can tell.
[00:13:32] Ben Horowitz: It was.
[00:13:33] Ben Horowitz: Mark was like super pissed.
[00:13:36] Ben Horowitz: And I just remember going, wow, like that's so disrespectful.
[00:13:40] Ben Horowitz: It was just like so crazy that that he would do that.
[00:13:43] I just made a little angel investment
[00:13:45] Margit Wennmachers: and like this entrepreneur is trying to raise money.
[00:13:48] Margit Wennmachers: And like literally she's been told by an investor.
[00:13:52] Margit Wennmachers: I think people like you just basically shouldn't exist.
[00:13:55] Margit Wennmachers: Guess how motivated she is.
[00:13:58] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:59] Margit Wennmachers: Show that motherfucker.
[00:14:00] Margit Wennmachers: This is the thing, the nuclear fire that you get
[00:14:02] Marc Andreessen: on the inside of that is, yes.
[00:14:03] Marc Andreessen: It's like a camp, people will actually say that out loud.
[00:14:06] Marc Andreessen: Exactly.
[00:14:07] Margit Wennmachers: And they're not like they're 95
[00:14:08] Margit Wennmachers: and they don't have a filter anymore.
[00:14:09] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:10] Margit Wennmachers: No, I mean, there was all these stories in this time,
[00:14:12] Marc Andreessen: but I mean, there were obviously many great VCs before us,
[00:14:14] Marc Andreessen: but they're, we, I mean, we went out and we basically met
[00:14:16] Marc Andreessen: all the, all the top VCs, you know,
[00:14:18] Marc Andreessen: kind of, because we were doing it.
[00:14:20] Marc Andreessen: And, you know, I'm a different guy,
[00:14:23] Marc Andreessen: one of the VCs at the time, I remember him saying,
[00:14:25] Marc Andreessen: oh, he's like, oh, yeah, venture is a great business.
[00:14:27] Marc Andreessen: Venture's like running, it's like going to a sushi boat restaurant.
[00:14:30] Marc Andreessen: It's like it's fantastic.
[00:14:32] Marc Andreessen: You just like, you just, it's sushi boat restaurant.
[00:14:34] Marc Andreessen: It's like it's fantastic.
[00:14:35] Marc Andreessen: You could just sit at the counter
[00:14:36] Marc Andreessen: and like the start of just like come drifting by.
[00:14:38] Marc Andreessen: And you're just like, oh, he's like every once in a while,
[00:14:42] Marc Andreessen: you know, whenever you want, you just reach out
[00:14:43] Marc Andreessen: and you just like pluck a piece of sushi.
[00:14:45] Marc Andreessen: Oh, she's like, I'm thinking, you know what?
[00:14:49] Marc Andreessen: I'm not sure that this is going to be as hard as we thought it was.
[00:14:52] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:14:53] Marc Andreessen: You mean competing parts?
[00:14:55] Margit Wennmachers: competing parts.
[00:14:56] Ben Horowitz: Yeah, it's very informative in how we thought about competing.
[00:15:00] Ben Horowitz: We were like, and still to this day,
[00:15:03] Ben Horowitz: when we think about the culture of the firm,
[00:15:06] Ben Horowitz: it's like, don't be that.
[00:15:07] Ben Horowitz: Yes, yes, yes.
[00:15:08] Ben Horowitz: You know, don't, don't be Mr. Smartypants like sitting in your,
[00:15:12] Ben Horowitz: you sent him wrote office waiting for the sushi boat to come out.
[00:15:16] Ben Horowitz: Like, and yeah, I mean, look, yeah, maybe the competition isn't a hard,
[00:15:21] Margit Wennmachers: but it felt like to me when I was at the out on the outcast side,
[00:15:25] Margit Wennmachers: it felt like to me the top five firms never changed.
[00:15:29] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:15:30] Margit Wennmachers: Like never, ever changed, right?
[00:15:32] Margit Wennmachers: And you guys didn't, you guys hadn't peeled off from a VC firm
[00:15:36] Margit Wennmachers: and therefore you didn't have a try.
[00:15:37] Margit Wennmachers: I mean, you had made some angel investments, but like, basically,
[00:15:41] Margit Wennmachers: not so much, not to be insulting, but like,
[00:15:44] Margit Wennmachers: we had no professional.
[00:15:45] Marc Andreessen: Yeah, so,
[00:15:46] Marc Andreessen: the angel fund was like $2 million.
[00:15:48] Ben Horowitz: Yeah, we had no tram, we had no training.
[00:15:50] Marc Andreessen: Right.
[00:15:51] Marc Andreessen: And then, you know, the all, like,
[00:15:54] Margit Wennmachers: there are exceptions, but all the important companies,
[00:15:57] Margit Wennmachers: they're just like, the top five firms invest.
[00:16:00] Margit Wennmachers: So like the conundrum was like, okay,
[00:16:02] Margit Wennmachers: how do you break into that list without the substance, right?
[00:16:07] Margit Wennmachers: Just with the ideas.
[00:16:08] Margit Wennmachers: One more story, one more story from the,
[00:16:10] Marc Andreessen: you're gonna miss this one.
[00:16:11] Marc Andreessen: I love to tell the old piece.
[00:16:12] Marc Andreessen: Another guy said, oh, he's like,
[00:16:15] Marc Andreessen: help pieces like LPs.
[00:16:16] Marc Andreessen: You guys are gonna, you guys are gonna hate
[00:16:18] Marc Andreessen: you on LPs.
[00:16:19] Marc Andreessen: They're just the worst.
[00:16:21] Marc Andreessen: It's good to tell the competitor.
[00:16:22] Marc Andreessen: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:16:23] Margit Wennmachers: And he said, and he said the key is, he said,
[00:16:25] Marc Andreessen: I realized after a long career, I realized the key is,
[00:16:27] Marc Andreessen: you want to treat the LPs like mushrooms.
[00:16:28] Marc Andreessen: Yeah, like mushrooms.
[00:16:30] Marc Andreessen: Like mushrooms.
[00:16:31] Marc Andreessen: We were like, man, to the mushrooms.
[00:16:33] Ben Horowitz: What was that we, what are we talking about?
[00:16:35] Ben Horowitz: So the trick mushrooms is you put them in a cardboard box,
[00:16:37] Marc Andreessen: you put the lid of the cardboard box,
[00:16:39] Marc Andreessen: you put it under your bed for two years.
[00:16:41] Marc Andreessen: And then you don't take the box out
[00:16:42] Marc Andreessen: until the next time you have to raise money.
[00:16:43] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:16:44] Marc Andreessen: Okay, so that's great.
[00:16:46] Marc Andreessen: And it was so funny because the whole time,
[00:16:52] Ben Horowitz: we're thinking, wow, you know, we're coming out
[00:16:54] Ben Horowitz: of running a public company.
[00:16:56] Ben Horowitz: Yes.
[00:16:56] Ben Horowitz: We've got like, we're meeting with investors
[00:16:58] Ben Horowitz: who are shorting our stock.
[00:16:59] Ben Horowitz: And like, these guys have like,
[00:17:01] Ben Horowitz: very nice universities.
[00:17:02] Ben Horowitz: These are very nice universities.
[00:17:04] Ben Horowitz: 40-year-old time, right?
[00:17:04] Ben Horowitz: Which is like super pleasant to talk to
[00:17:06] Ben Horowitz: when we went out there.
[00:17:07] Ben Horowitz: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:17:08] Ben Horowitz: And I think just think things to say is just so,
[00:17:11] Ben Horowitz: it's like, wow, you guys are living in like a weird,
[00:17:14] Ben Horowitz: perceptive world.
[00:17:15] Ben Horowitz: One of the surprising things to me,
[00:17:18] Margit Wennmachers: I had not ever met LPs because I wasn't on that side
[00:17:21] Margit Wennmachers: of the business.
[00:17:22] Margit Wennmachers: But like, it's a really great community.
[00:17:25] Margit Wennmachers: And a lot of them are super, super mission driven.
[00:17:27] Margit Wennmachers: They're not financiers.
[00:17:29] Margit Wennmachers: They're just the very cool people.
[00:17:32] Margit Wennmachers: They're very long time horizons.
[00:17:33] Marc Andreessen: Yes.
[00:17:34] Marc Andreessen: And very patient.
[00:17:35] Marc Andreessen: Very devoted to their institutions.
[00:17:36] Marc Andreessen: Very smart.
[00:17:37] Marc Andreessen: It's been all their time thinking about, right,
[00:17:39] Marc Andreessen: all these topics.
[00:17:40] Marc Andreessen: They've been incredible, we have incredible discussions.
[00:17:42] Marc Andreessen: Great investors.
[00:17:43] Ben Horowitz: And very patient and you know,
[00:17:46] Ben Horowitz: want to understand the strategy,
[00:17:48] Ben Horowitz: care about the strategy,
[00:17:49] Ben Horowitz: plan to be in it a long time with us,
[00:17:51] Ben Horowitz: all that kind of thing.
[00:17:53] Ben Horowitz: It's, yeah, it was just very interesting.
[00:17:56] Ben Horowitz: But that was fun.
[00:17:57] Ben Horowitz: Like, it goes through the stories
[00:17:58] Ben Horowitz: because it is so indicative of so many of these things.
[00:18:00] Marc Andreessen: There are certain industries at certain times
[00:18:02] Marc Andreessen: where they just get wedged.
[00:18:03] Marc Andreessen: They get locked into patterns.
[00:18:06] Marc Andreessen: And the most uncomfortable thing in the world
[00:18:08] Marc Andreessen: is to break the pattern.
[00:18:10] Marc Andreessen: And if you don't have to,
[00:18:11] Marc Andreessen: you know, if you don't have to, you don't.
[00:18:12] Marc Andreessen: And if you think of it as a sushi situation,
[00:18:15] Margit Wennmachers: or a mushroom situation,
[00:18:17] Margit Wennmachers: why would you ever do marketing?
[00:18:19] Right, exactly, right.
[00:18:20] Marc Andreessen: Then the whole right thing.
[00:18:21] Margit Wennmachers: Why would you ever?
[00:18:22] Marc Andreessen: Black box, cartel.
[00:18:23] Marc Andreessen: Some is steep, some like mystical,
[00:18:27] Margit Wennmachers: very, whatever you'd like to do.
[00:18:29] Margit Wennmachers: It's way better.
[00:18:30] Margit Wennmachers: There's no pressure on it, right?
[00:18:32] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah, it was a very good strategy,
[00:18:34] Ben Horowitz: which is why we went out with the marketing
[00:18:36] Ben Horowitz: and then, of course, so we do the press tour.
[00:18:41] Ben Horowitz: And you get Mark on the cover of Fortune,
[00:18:46] Ben Horowitz: which was, that was amazing to me
[00:18:49] Ben Horowitz: because we had been running a company all these years.
[00:18:51] Ben Horowitz: And I remember you saying,
[00:18:53] Ben Horowitz: do you want to be on the cover of Fortune Forbes
[00:18:55] Ben Horowitz: or Business Week?
[00:18:56] Ben Horowitz: And I was like,
[00:18:57] Ben Horowitz: this is where you get a choice.
[00:18:59] Marc Andreessen: Yeah, this is like, yeah, being on,
[00:19:00] Marc Andreessen: I don't know, I don't know,
[00:19:01] Marc Andreessen: Vatican Museum, it's just like the most important thing
[00:19:04] Marc Andreessen: you can possibly have.
[00:19:04] Marc Andreessen: Yeah, those things.
[00:19:05] Marc Andreessen: Yeah, at the time.
[00:19:06] Marc Andreessen: In those days, those magazines,
[00:19:07] Ben Horowitz: particularly the covers were like,
[00:19:09] Ben Horowitz: incredibly important, tough to get.
[00:19:11] Ben Horowitz: And then, and then the thing that,
[00:19:13] Ben Horowitz: like really blew my mind was, I said, Fortune,
[00:19:16] Ben Horowitz: and then you got Mark on the cover of Fortune.
[00:19:19] Ben Horowitz: And, and,
[00:19:20] Ben Horowitz: For the first time in a lifetime,
[00:19:21] Ben Horowitz: nobody was gonna put me on the cover
[00:19:23] Ben Horowitz: or anything in those days, so.
[00:19:25] No, but you get to be on the cover of Fortune
[00:19:27] Margit Wennmachers: when you did your book.
[00:19:28] Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I did, I did.
[00:19:29] Ben Horowitz: But that, we had to make famous first, yeah.
[00:19:33] Margit Wennmachers: Look, the thing is, you never get what you don't ask for, right?
[00:19:37] Margit Wennmachers: And then, it's, it's a, come, like at the time,
[00:19:41] Margit Wennmachers: the publications matter really.
[00:19:43] Margit Wennmachers: Now it's just the writer who matters.
[00:19:46] Margit Wennmachers: And then also now they're downstream
[00:19:47] Margit Wennmachers: from all the entire internet, right?
[00:19:49] Margit Wennmachers: Like they come in at the end, basically.
[00:19:52] Margit Wennmachers: But Kevin Manie was a really good writer.
[00:19:56] Margit Wennmachers: He had had a really strong track record.
[00:19:59] Margit Wennmachers: Like, you know, followed him forever.
[00:20:01] Margit Wennmachers: And he would write substance of curiosity,
[00:20:03] Margit Wennmachers: or different stories, right?
[00:20:05] Margit Wennmachers: And he was great.
[00:20:06] Margit Wennmachers: The worst part about that whole thing was that I'm photoshopped.
[00:20:08] Margit Wennmachers: The smart kids stuff.
[00:20:10] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:20:11] And, and I got no memory when you,
[00:20:13] Margit Wennmachers: when you did that thing or thing, I want you.
[00:20:16] Margit Wennmachers: It's like, that's gonna be it.
[00:20:17] Margit Wennmachers: Like, this is not even a question.
[00:20:18] Margit Wennmachers: But that was the worst part about it.
[00:20:20] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:21] Ben Horowitz: Now, it was good.
[00:20:22] Ben Horowitz: It was a scary picture.
[00:20:24] So it was good.
[00:20:24] It was, it was some fun.
[00:20:27] Ben Horowitz: But that, that kind of set off,
[00:20:30] Ben Horowitz: kind of really positioning us.
[00:20:34] Ben Horowitz: At that point, we knew we weren't gonna be friendly
[00:20:37] Ben Horowitz: with the industry.
[00:20:37] Ben Horowitz: So we were not only not gonna be in the cartel,
[00:20:41] Ben Horowitz: we were gonna be against the cartel
[00:20:43] Ben Horowitz: because they hated that cover story.
[00:20:45] Ben Horowitz: Oh my God.
[00:20:47] Ben Horowitz: I mean, they went bananas.
[00:20:49] Ben Horowitz: They called every LP.
[00:20:50] Ben Horowitz: They're like these guys, they're ego maniacs.
[00:20:53] Ben Horowitz: Look at him.
[00:20:54] Ben Horowitz: I'm gonna cover the magazine.
[00:20:55] Ben Horowitz: That's not supposed to be him.
[00:20:57] Ben Horowitz: That's supposed to be the entrepreneur.
[00:20:59] Ben Horowitz: What the hell?
[00:21:00] Ben Horowitz: I mean, they just like a westerner.
[00:21:02] Ben Horowitz: Well, I didn't have any of the rumors for the top.
[00:21:05] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah, I mean, that's, no.
[00:21:07] No, that's, that's bananas.
[00:21:09] Margit Wennmachers: I think that comes from them viewing having to do
[00:21:13] Margit Wennmachers: any of those kinds of outbound activities
[00:21:15] Margit Wennmachers: as beneath them and kind of unseemly.
[00:21:18] Margit Wennmachers: And here we were like, like unashamed
[00:21:21] Margit Wennmachers: about like advertising ourselves and our wares,
[00:21:24] Margit Wennmachers: if you will, right?
[00:21:25] Margit Wennmachers: So I was kind of like, what?
[00:21:26] Margit Wennmachers: We're doing what now.
[00:21:27] Margit Wennmachers: And it works, I think.
[00:21:30] Margit Wennmachers: And I think it got sort of, I think that,
[00:21:33] but like mostly I think the writing got us in
[00:21:37] Margit Wennmachers: with the entrepreneurs because like I remember,
[00:21:40] Margit Wennmachers: I think it was you Mark told me that an entrepreneur said,
[00:21:42] Margit Wennmachers: like, I kind of feel like I know you guys a little bit.
[00:21:44] Margit Wennmachers: That's right.
[00:21:45] Margit Wennmachers: Having not even met you yet.
[00:21:46] Marc Andreessen: Yeah, so they hadn't been our offices.
[00:21:48] Marc Andreessen: They hadn't met anybody, but they had some idea
[00:21:51] Margit Wennmachers: of that who are these people?
[00:21:53] Margit Wennmachers: And what do they care about?
[00:21:54] Margit Wennmachers: Nothing in there.
[00:21:54] Margit Wennmachers: From then on, every time a GP would come on board,
[00:21:58] Margit Wennmachers: we're like, okay, what do you want to invest in?
[00:22:01] Margit Wennmachers: Therefore, we're going to write about these things.
[00:22:03] Margit Wennmachers: Because that is becomes the magnet for the entrepreneurs
[00:22:07] Margit Wennmachers: in that corner of the internet or AI infrastructure,
[00:22:10] Margit Wennmachers: whatever it is.
[00:22:11] Margit Wennmachers: And I think that was really powerful,
[00:22:13] Margit Wennmachers: particularly with the entrepreneurs.
[00:22:15] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah, it was kind of one of, in those days,
[00:22:19] Ben Horowitz: the C was like a big secret.
[00:22:22] Ben Horowitz: And then actually building companies was a big secret.
[00:22:24] Ben Horowitz: And so just kind of talking about it was a big differentiator.
[00:22:28] Ben Horowitz: Which you would learn.
[00:22:30] Ben Horowitz: You would hear these horror stories from other entrepreneurs
[00:22:33] Marc Andreessen: of things that had gone wrong in the relationship
[00:22:35] Marc Andreessen: with the VC and all the problems.
[00:22:36] Marc Andreessen: But you didn't know, like, if you didn't know
[00:22:38] Marc Andreessen: how many people were when you walk in the door,
[00:22:39] Marc Andreessen: like, who do you trust?
[00:22:40] Marc Andreessen: How are they going to behave under pressure?
[00:22:42] Marc Andreessen: What are they going to do?
[00:22:44] Marc Andreessen: And so, I mean, yeah, it's a great,
[00:22:46] Marc Andreessen: so if you can get away with having nobody know who you are
[00:22:48] Marc Andreessen: and still be on top of the industry, it's great.
[00:22:51] Marc Andreessen: But like, if somebody actually does it the other way,
[00:22:55] Marc Andreessen: it causes a permanent change,
[00:22:56] Marc Andreessen: which I think what we can't last.
[00:22:58] Marc Andreessen: It does.
[00:22:59] Margit Wennmachers: And to me, I don't know the latest numbers,
[00:23:01] Margit Wennmachers: but like the blog posts that you would write
[00:23:06] Margit Wennmachers: or the other GPs would write that are sort of like timeless.
[00:23:09] Margit Wennmachers: Like, I remember the good product manager,
[00:23:11] Margit Wennmachers: but I found that like, that is one of the most successful blog posts.
[00:23:14] Margit Wennmachers: And you know how many blog posts the firmers put out?
[00:23:16] Margit Wennmachers: Like, the good Gillian, right?
[00:23:18] Margit Wennmachers: But like the ones that have depths that the entrepreneurs can,
[00:23:21] Margit Wennmachers: like, take something from.
[00:23:22] Margit Wennmachers: And that is somewhat timeless,
[00:23:24] Margit Wennmachers: way more important than are we in a bubble?
[00:23:27] Margit Wennmachers: Or are we not in a bubble?
[00:23:28] Margit Wennmachers: That was kind of fun and that was like, like chatter.
[00:23:32] Margit Wennmachers: But like the substance of pieces on like,
[00:23:34] Margit Wennmachers: how do I construct a company?
[00:23:36] Margit Wennmachers: How do I manage a person?
[00:23:38] Margit Wennmachers: How do I think about promotions?
[00:23:39] Margit Wennmachers: Like all that kind of stuff?
[00:23:41] Margit Wennmachers: Like, I think that that was really valuable to the entrepreneurs.
[00:23:44] Margit Wennmachers: And I think I also showed our all piece like,
[00:23:45] Margit Wennmachers: okay, they actually are very passionate about
[00:23:48] Margit Wennmachers: all the details of the stuff that they invest in.
[00:23:50] Margit Wennmachers: Well, that was one of the interesting things
[00:23:51] Ben Horowitz: is the LPs were like reading all the content.
[00:23:54] Ben Horowitz: I mean, which is so different than public market investors,
[00:23:59] Ben Horowitz: I say, you know, they, and not only did they read the content,
[00:24:03] Ben Horowitz: but we have many LPs that Reddit would call up, say,
[00:24:08] Ben Horowitz: hey, in managing my little organization, you know,
[00:24:13] Ben Horowitz: this is what I'm running into and so forth.
[00:24:15] Ben Horowitz: So they really, they're real partners.
[00:24:17] Ben Horowitz: Right.
[00:24:18] Ben Horowitz: So it's a way that, yeah, it's just been,
[00:24:21] Ben Horowitz: that's been probably one of the best parts of the firm
[00:24:23] Ben Horowitz: is to get to have investors like that.
[00:24:27] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah, we got one, we did one incredibly controversial block
[00:24:30] Margit Wennmachers: was turns out, like a few LPs really hated the headline.
[00:24:33] Margit Wennmachers: And it was, it was in the bio and health team
[00:24:37] Margit Wennmachers: and it said, fuck cancer, which I thought was a very controversial
[00:24:40] Margit Wennmachers: that he obviously so nice.
[00:24:42] Margit Wennmachers: They were like, did you have to put it that way?
[00:24:44] Margit Wennmachers: I mean, they're very, they put this on like a rifle.
[00:24:48] Margit Wennmachers: Screw cancer.
[00:24:50] Yes.
[00:24:51] Marc Andreessen: For the record, we're very anti-cancer.
[00:24:53] Marc Andreessen: Yeah, we're very anti-cancer.
[00:24:55] Marc Andreessen: And we're willing to say so.
[00:24:56] Marc Andreessen: But they're deeply care about everything that we put out,
[00:24:59] Margit Wennmachers: which I think is quite flour, even though they may hate some of it.
[00:25:03] Margit Wennmachers: So one of the things in the early days that I wanted to ask you about
[00:25:06] Ben Horowitz: is like, because we came out and because they kind of,
[00:25:11] Ben Horowitz: we caused that reaction with the other VCs,
[00:25:15] Ben Horowitz: I kind of felt like we, you know, maybe I took it too far
[00:25:19] Ben Horowitz: in terms of just the VC competitiveness and the anti-VC stuff.
[00:25:25] Ben Horowitz: Like we really went hard in the early days.
[00:25:28] Ben Horowitz: So they were like, essentially brought this up.
[00:25:30] Ben Horowitz: Over the line.
[00:25:31] Marc Andreessen: So since you brought this up, you have to, you have to,
[00:25:33] Marc Andreessen: your thing with the, was it the serolacy?
[00:25:35] Marc Andreessen: Oh, yeah.
[00:25:36] Marc Andreessen: The peak of this was the, your peak moment of this
[00:25:38] Marc Andreessen: was in the serolacy thing.
[00:25:39] Marc Andreessen: Okay, so it's a refresh, remember?
[00:25:41] Ben Horowitz: Okay, so remember serolacy, at her peak, by the way,
[00:25:44] Ben Horowitz: she was a great, great journalist.
[00:25:47] Ben Horowitz: And then she had this thing, Pando Daily,
[00:25:50] Ben Horowitz: that she started, and then she had this, these big events.
[00:25:54] Ben Horowitz: And I spoke at the event.
[00:25:56] Ben Horowitz: And she said, she said to me, and it's just like,
[00:26:00] Ben Horowitz: it popped out, she said, you know, you,
[00:26:03] Ben Horowitz: you kind of like have a lot of conflict with the other VCs.
[00:26:07] Ben Horowitz: And I said, well, I said, I come from enterprise software.
[00:26:13] Ben Horowitz: And so like when I see another VC coming at me,
[00:26:16] Ben Horowitz: and I quoted a little Wayne with the peacine,
[00:26:20] Ben Horowitz: all I see is a trigger and the middle finger.
[00:26:23] Ben Horowitz: And that's, so my answer was going to be that,
[00:26:28] Margit Wennmachers: like, you have an inner enterprise sales dude in you.
[00:26:32] Margit Wennmachers: And like, if there's ever, like, I think like,
[00:26:37] Margit Wennmachers: when it comes to other firms, it's like, which is horseshit?
[00:26:40] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:26:41] Margit Wennmachers: And then we can invest, like, we don't actually compete all that much.
[00:26:46] Margit Wennmachers: But basically your filter is like,
[00:26:50] you're going to get the deal, or I'm going to get the deal.
[00:26:53] Margit Wennmachers: You die or I die.
[00:26:54] Margit Wennmachers: It's like, that's that's sort of the thing that happens to you
[00:26:58] Margit Wennmachers: in any sort of competitive situation.
[00:27:00] Margit Wennmachers: And you got help if you're on the way of that.
[00:27:03] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:27:04] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:27:05] Margit Wennmachers: I think we over did it because like I said,
[00:27:07] Margit Wennmachers: like you guys have joined Bortseys.
[00:27:09] Margit Wennmachers: We will, our teams will call people is like,
[00:27:11] Margit Wennmachers: hey, we've got this company.
[00:27:12] Margit Wennmachers: Would you like to do follow-on of this?
[00:27:14] Margit Wennmachers: And all that stuff here, you are to sign them off.
[00:27:16] Margit Wennmachers: And we cause a lot of, I cause a lot of antagonism
[00:27:19] Ben Horowitz: between us and the other firms in that state,
[00:27:21] Ben Horowitz: which I think we, you know, at this point,
[00:27:23] Ben Horowitz: like we're more friendly.
[00:27:24] Ben Horowitz: Like at this point, I think.
[00:27:25] Ben Horowitz: More friendly.
[00:27:26] Marc Andreessen: And they're not exactly shrinking about what's them.
[00:27:28] Marc Andreessen: So, you know, they're also, also, also,
[00:27:30] Marc Andreessen: also true, also true.
[00:27:31] Margit Wennmachers: They're originally the case.
[00:27:33] Marc Andreessen: Yes.
[00:27:34] Marc Andreessen: Yes.
[00:27:35] Marc Andreessen: Yes.
[00:27:36] Margit Wennmachers: I think we're past that maybe, maybe now.
[00:27:39] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:27:40] Margit Wennmachers: I think we're much more user-friendly now, for sure,
[00:27:43] Ben Horowitz: in terms of our VC partners that we have.
[00:27:48] Ben Horowitz: So, then tell us, you know,
[00:27:51] Ben Horowitz: one of the big pieces that came out was
[00:27:54] Ben Horowitz: when Mark wrote Software is Eating the World.
[00:27:57] Ben Horowitz: And how that came about was very interesting
[00:28:01] Ben Horowitz: because it was a really busy time for us.
[00:28:02] Ben Horowitz: It's like what, 2011, so it was very,
[00:28:04] Ben Horowitz: I think we had just raised a second fund, maybe.
[00:28:07] Ben Horowitz: And the way it came about was tire-ly random, if you will.
[00:28:10] Margit Wennmachers: So, at the time there was a guy, you know,
[00:28:13] Margit Wennmachers: the economist has these reporters
[00:28:15] Margit Wennmachers: and they sent them to new regions and new beats,
[00:28:17] Margit Wennmachers: like for 25 years and they go from Hong Kong to Silicon Valley, whatever.
[00:28:21] Margit Wennmachers: At the time, there was a guy called Martin Giles.
[00:28:23] Margit Wennmachers: Oh, yeah, Martin Giles.
[00:28:24] Margit Wennmachers: And he was covering.
[00:28:25] Margit Wennmachers: Very nice guy.
[00:28:26] Margit Wennmachers: Yes.
[00:28:27] Ben Horowitz: Very nice guy.
[00:28:28] Margit Wennmachers: Great guy.
[00:28:29] Margit Wennmachers: And he would cover Silicon Valley,
[00:28:32] Margit Wennmachers: he was a British, and every so often,
[00:28:35] Margit Wennmachers: I forget what the cadence is.
[00:28:36] Margit Wennmachers: They do a special report.
[00:28:37] Margit Wennmachers: And they were doing a special report
[00:28:39] Margit Wennmachers: on the state of tech and where it was going.
[00:28:41] Margit Wennmachers: And we were sitting,
[00:28:43] Margit Wennmachers: remember my first office was at this office?
[00:28:45] Margit Wennmachers: I think it was next door.
[00:28:46] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah, that's right.
[00:28:47] Margit Wennmachers: It was like, we, the three of us were sitting here
[00:28:49] Margit Wennmachers: and Martin was visiting,
[00:28:50] Margit Wennmachers: and he's asking all these questions.
[00:28:51] Margit Wennmachers: And Mark was like, well, it's basically,
[00:28:52] Margit Wennmachers: like Software's Eating the World,
[00:28:53] Margit Wennmachers: and then he explained something.
[00:28:55] Margit Wennmachers: And I'm like, this is really interesting.
[00:28:58] Margit Wennmachers: And then I was like, we should write this down.
[00:29:01] Margit Wennmachers: And Mark's like, sure, maybe later,
[00:29:03] Margit Wennmachers: and then I placed it with this guy, Ryan,
[00:29:05] Margit Wennmachers: at the Walter Journal,
[00:29:06] Margit Wennmachers: and he's like, if I had an op-out like that,
[00:29:08] Margit Wennmachers: would you run it?
[00:29:09] Margit Wennmachers: And he's like, yeah, sure, I would run it.
[00:29:11] Margit Wennmachers: And then Mark wrote it when you could schedule things.
[00:29:15] Margit Wennmachers: Like that.
[00:29:16] Margit Wennmachers: And Mark wrote exactly one draft,
[00:29:18] Margit Wennmachers: and it's still that same draft.
[00:29:19] Margit Wennmachers: And I'm sure you're torturing yourself
[00:29:21] Margit Wennmachers: because you would change all kinds of things,
[00:29:22] Margit Wennmachers: this, not the other.
[00:29:23] Margit Wennmachers: And then just for kicks,
[00:29:25] Margit Wennmachers: to book end that story,
[00:29:28] Margit Wennmachers: when you wrote, was it, it's time to build?
[00:29:30] Margit Wennmachers: It's time to build.
[00:29:31] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:29:32] Margit Wennmachers: Wrote it's time to build.
[00:29:33] Margit Wennmachers: Like you caved for a minute,
[00:29:34] Margit Wennmachers: and said like, all right,
[00:29:35] Margit Wennmachers: a little place it.
[00:29:36] Margit Wennmachers: Maybe we'll place it.
[00:29:37] Margit Wennmachers: And nobody took it.
[00:29:39] Margit Wennmachers: Nobody.
[00:29:40] Margit Wennmachers: Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:29:41] Margit Wennmachers: I called Ryan,
[00:29:42] Margit Wennmachers: who has since gone on to bigger and better things.
[00:29:44] Margit Wennmachers: I'm like, Ryan,
[00:29:45] Margit Wennmachers: ask your hypothetical, that thing,
[00:29:47] Margit Wennmachers: like if I, like you've been at the Journal,
[00:29:49] Margit Wennmachers: and you're like, of course, like,
[00:29:50] Margit Wennmachers: it's just joke.
[00:29:51] Margit Wennmachers: That's not even a question.
[00:29:53] Margit Wennmachers: But times have changed.
[00:29:54] Margit Wennmachers: So nobody ran it.
[00:29:55] Margit Wennmachers: Wow.
[00:29:56] Good thing we had.
[00:29:57] Margit Wennmachers: It's a big piece of it.
[00:29:58] Margit Wennmachers: We had a good audience at the time.
[00:29:59] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:30:00] Margit Wennmachers: No, and I, I think,
[00:30:01] Margit Wennmachers: forget it.
[00:30:02] Margit Wennmachers: Don't want to malign people,
[00:30:03] Margit Wennmachers: but somebody said it's angry.
[00:30:04] Margit Wennmachers: And I'm like,
[00:30:05] Margit Wennmachers: you know, we're in a pandemic.
[00:30:06] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:07] Margit Wennmachers: So this is where we are wearing conscious.
[00:30:08] Margit Wennmachers: There's 20, 20.
[00:30:09] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:30:10] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:30:11] Marc Andreessen: The whole point of it was just that
[00:30:12] Marc Andreessen: what was actually happening in the pandemic
[00:30:13] Marc Andreessen: with literally the inability to get,
[00:30:14] Marc Andreessen: like surgical gowns.
[00:30:15] Marc Andreessen: And that for first responders was like the catalyst for it.
[00:30:19] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:30:20] Marc Andreessen: It's interesting.
[00:30:21] Margit Wennmachers: It's ready to angry.
[00:30:22] Margit Wennmachers: And I was like, yeah, yeah.
[00:30:23] Ben Horowitz: Suffer is eating the world is probably more famous,
[00:30:25] Ben Horowitz: but I'd say time to build is more influential in that.
[00:30:30] People read software is eating the world
[00:30:32] Ben Horowitz: and then they didn't do anything.
[00:30:33] Ben Horowitz: They were like, wow, that's very interesting.
[00:30:35] Ben Horowitz: And that was it.
[00:30:36] Ben Horowitz: But with time to build, like, the number of people in, like,
[00:30:40] Ben Horowitz: Washington and entrepreneurial community and so forth that are like,
[00:30:43] Ben Horowitz: yeah, we're taking this.
[00:30:45] Ben Horowitz: This is a blueprint.
[00:30:46] Ben Horowitz: We're moving on it.
[00:30:47] Ben Horowitz: I mean, in a way like the whole like abundant movement
[00:30:50] Ben Horowitz: on the Democratic Party came off of that.
[00:30:52] Ben Horowitz: Which is a great development.
[00:30:53] Ben Horowitz: It's a great development.
[00:30:54] Ben Horowitz: But I think that I have a theory on why that is.
[00:30:57] Margit Wennmachers: Software is eating the world.
[00:30:58] Margit Wennmachers: It's like to our people, our community, the,
[00:31:01] Margit Wennmachers: hello, that's happening.
[00:31:02] Margit Wennmachers: And they were all building against it.
[00:31:04] Margit Wennmachers: They didn't need to read the thing.
[00:31:06] Margit Wennmachers: And the people who needed to do something were going to get flattened
[00:31:09] Margit Wennmachers: by the software eating the world movement.
[00:31:11] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:31:12] Margit Wennmachers: And they didn't know what to do.
[00:31:13] Margit Wennmachers: Like, how do you retool into, like, remember all the car companies
[00:31:17] Margit Wennmachers: that came to visit us, right?
[00:31:18] Margit Wennmachers: And you've taken through autonomous and does the brand even matter?
[00:31:20] Margit Wennmachers: And whatever.
[00:31:21] Margit Wennmachers: It just did not register.
[00:31:23] They were going to become a software company.
[00:31:25] Margit Wennmachers: Therefore, nobody, nobody who needed to do something that did.
[00:31:28] Margit Wennmachers: It's just rather difficult.
[00:31:30] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:31:31] Margit Wennmachers: So, you know, one of the very interesting things that we've learned
[00:31:36] Ben Horowitz: as a firm is how unusual it is for a company that's been around
[00:31:41] Ben Horowitz: a long time.
[00:31:42] Ben Horowitz: And where the founders are no longer there to change anything.
[00:31:47] Ben Horowitz: Anything.
[00:31:48] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:31:49] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:31:50] Ben Horowitz: And I mean, it's been a huge blessing for us in venture capital
[00:31:54] Ben Horowitz: and that many of the firms that were extremely powerful when we started
[00:31:59] Ben Horowitz: just never changed.
[00:32:01] Ben Horowitz: They're exactly as it were.
[00:32:03] Ben Horowitz: Like, it's almost like frozen in time.
[00:32:05] Ben Horowitz: It reminds me of, if you've ever been to Havana and Cuba.
[00:32:09] Ben Horowitz: It's frozen in time.
[00:32:11] Ben Horowitz: It's all 1959.
[00:32:12] Ben Horowitz: With cars in 1959.
[00:32:14] Ben Horowitz: It's amazing.
[00:32:15] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:32:16] Ben Horowitz: It's like just frozen.
[00:32:17] Ben Horowitz: And, you know, whole industries freeze like the Vado industry for sure
[00:32:21] Ben Horowitz: to.
[00:32:22] Ben Horowitz: And, you know, it was a.
[00:32:25] Ben Horowitz: Did you see?
[00:32:26] Ben Horowitz: You know, Elon was came along for what?
[00:32:29] Ben Horowitz: How long?
[00:32:30] Ben Horowitz: Wendy started to us early 2000s and, you know, had been going and going and going.
[00:32:33] Ben Horowitz: And then like, when the car comes out and is awesome, everybody is just like sitting there going.
[00:32:39] Ben Horowitz: What do we do?
[00:32:40] Ben Horowitz: I mean, look, I just saw this on X.
[00:32:42] Margit Wennmachers: I think like the lay off numbers up from the German car companies, my home country.
[00:32:46] Margit Wennmachers: Like every six job in Germany is somehow related to the auto industry.
[00:32:52] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:32:53] Margit Wennmachers: It's a disaster.
[00:32:54] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:32:55] Margit Wennmachers: But they're not going like the.
[00:32:57] Margit Wennmachers: A genius software engineers not going to you.
[00:33:00] Margit Wennmachers: They're going to want to work for Elon Musk.
[00:33:02] Margit Wennmachers: Like you can say about Elon Musk, whatever you want.
[00:33:04] Margit Wennmachers: But like a.
[00:33:05] Margit Wennmachers: Swav well manicured executive from the car industry is like not really like an.
[00:33:11] A talent magnet for software engineers.
[00:33:13] Margit Wennmachers: Right.
[00:33:14] Margit Wennmachers: So, and then you know, one of the things that happened early was I got a note from Harper Collins saying that I shared a book.
[00:33:26] Ben Horowitz: And, and you know, way I did not have time to write a book.
[00:33:30] Ben Horowitz: But you may.
[00:33:31] Ben Horowitz: Yeah, you thought, well, you thought it was a good idea to write the.
[00:33:34] Ben Horowitz: But why did you think it was a guy?
[00:33:35] Ben Horowitz: I guess it.
[00:33:36] Ben Horowitz: It seemed one.
[00:33:38] Ben Horowitz: It seemed crazy because the blog was doing so well.
[00:33:41] Ben Horowitz: So like, earn books pass a at least ask.
[00:33:44] Ben Horowitz: I mean, and then.
[00:33:47] Yeah, and then we didn't have to.
[00:33:48] Ben Horowitz: I didn't have time.
[00:33:49] Ben Horowitz: So like.
[00:33:51] Why did you think that made sense?
[00:33:53] Ben Horowitz: I guess it wasn't something that VCs did either.
[00:33:55] Ben Horowitz: Right.
[00:33:56] Ben Horowitz: Why I do.
[00:33:57] Ben Horowitz: I do think we needed to even out the brand a little bit because like otherwise any entrepreneur with leverage was going to go like, wow, I want him to be on my board.
[00:34:05] Margit Wennmachers: And that was just going to get success.
[00:34:06] Margit Wennmachers: We were so every other GP.
[00:34:08] Margit Wennmachers: So that was like, we needed a plan for everybody, right?
[00:34:11] Margit Wennmachers: And you were the other at the time.
[00:34:13] Margit Wennmachers: The other.
[00:34:14] Margit Wennmachers: I thought the book was good because I did.
[00:34:16] Margit Wennmachers: And Dries another.
[00:34:17] Margit Wennmachers: There is exactly.
[00:34:19] Margit Wennmachers: Which is why you want to call it for which I'd recent.
[00:34:21] Margit Wennmachers: I remember which.
[00:34:23] Margit Wennmachers: It does sound hard to recent.
[00:34:25] Ben Horowitz: It's a cool sounding name.
[00:34:26] Ben Horowitz: It sounds a little law firmish though.
[00:34:28] Ben Horowitz: And then you could never a 16 Z would like learn what H 16 N is.
[00:34:33] Ben Horowitz: Not nearly as good.
[00:34:34] Ben Horowitz: No, it's.
[00:34:35] Ben Horowitz: It is good.
[00:34:36] Ben Horowitz: The way it is.
[00:34:37] Margit Wennmachers: I do still think there is value in a book of like having a definitive theory on something.
[00:34:42] Margit Wennmachers: I think with all the blockers and all the expos and all that, I think there is value.
[00:34:46] Margit Wennmachers: People.
[00:34:47] Margit Wennmachers: People read books.
[00:34:48] Margit Wennmachers: People consume.
[00:34:49] Margit Wennmachers: Consume books.
[00:34:50] Margit Wennmachers: Long form podcasts.
[00:34:51] Margit Wennmachers: Sort of a different version of the same flavor.
[00:34:53] Margit Wennmachers: But more importantly, I thought you had something to say.
[00:34:56] Margit Wennmachers: Like the actual theory of like how one builds a company and like all the stuff that goes sideways.
[00:35:04] Margit Wennmachers: And as you always said, most books like whoever the guy was from this and that GE, whatever,
[00:35:10] Margit Wennmachers: they were all kind of fancy resumes and victory labs.
[00:35:14] Margit Wennmachers: They weren't really where you could learn something particularly for our audience.
[00:35:18] Margit Wennmachers: That like it's so rough and tumble to be in a startup and to be in the trenches and to lose the deal
[00:35:24] Margit Wennmachers: and like not be able to raise the money and you have this magical person mark out the door and all that kind of stuff.
[00:35:28] Margit Wennmachers: So having an honest book that I think you I was expecting you to write.
[00:35:32] Margit Wennmachers: I thought was really valuable.
[00:35:33] Margit Wennmachers: And then you know the little hack that we had is you had written all the block posts.
[00:35:38] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:35:39] Margit Wennmachers: Right.
[00:35:40] Margit Wennmachers: And so then it was a little built in on it.
[00:35:42] Ben Horowitz: Right.
[00:35:43] Margit Wennmachers: And then it was it's telling the dramatic story of like what went down, you know, including with fleesha being sick and all of that.
[00:35:49] Margit Wennmachers: Right.
[00:35:50] Margit Wennmachers: And then that then made the book.
[00:35:52] But like you kind of had the lessons in your head.
[00:35:55] And like I actually think that book like I liked the title.
[00:35:59] Margit Wennmachers: I've been living by what you do is who you are forever.
[00:36:02] Margit Wennmachers: I like that title better.
[00:36:03] Margit Wennmachers: But I think this is more important book and it's way more kind of usable for for people.
[00:36:08] Ben Horowitz: It's much more broad based.
[00:36:09] Ben Horowitz: I think the what you do is who you are is it's actually is more useful for me.
[00:36:15] Ben Horowitz: And you know when I talk to like Ted Sarandos or somebody like that, they're like, oh yeah, that's a book.
[00:36:20] Ben Horowitz: I like, but you have to run a very large organization.
[00:36:23] Ben Horowitz: Right.
[00:36:24] Ben Horowitz: And you have to have gotten beyond the things that are hard thing about hard things to start to think about.
[00:36:30] Ben Horowitz: Okay.
[00:36:31] Ben Horowitz: How do you program the culture of the whole organization and this kind of.
[00:36:35] Ben Horowitz: But I remember the Navy to abstract wanting to wanting to buy the book the hard thing about hard things.
[00:36:40] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:36:41] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:36:42] Margit Wennmachers: And I think people actually think it's much more applicable than you might think.
[00:36:45] Margit Wennmachers: Well, oh no, no, so it's very the hard thing about hard things.
[00:36:50] Ben Horowitz: I would say in retrospect was very broadly applicable like pastors bought it and you know, people you'd never think.
[00:36:58] Ben Horowitz: But you know, like to me, everything in the hard thing about hard things is like easy.
[00:37:03] Ben Horowitz: Whereas I had to think a lot more about what you do is who you are.
[00:37:07] Ben Horowitz: It's just like a, but you know, it's one of those things.
[00:37:10] Ben Horowitz: You know, how many people need to learn algebra versus quantum physics?
[00:37:16] Ben Horowitz: It's a thing like that.
[00:37:18] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:37:19] Margit Wennmachers: That's a good point.
[00:37:20] Margit Wennmachers: No, I actually thought the book was valuable to your brand and a good equalizer.
[00:37:25] Margit Wennmachers: And also, I think it raised the ambition.
[00:37:28] Margit Wennmachers: Like when we then hired new GPs, it was just understood that they were going to be out in the world.
[00:37:35] Margit Wennmachers: And then it was a matter for me, for my team to go like, okay, so what are your thoughts?
[00:37:39] Margit Wennmachers: Hopefully you have some, right?
[00:37:41] Margit Wennmachers: And then what are you good at?
[00:37:42] Margit Wennmachers: And then matching the format.
[00:37:44] Margit Wennmachers: Not everybody should write a book, right?
[00:37:46] Margit Wennmachers: And not everybody should do podcasts.
[00:37:48] Some people are good with decks and all of that.
[00:37:50] Margit Wennmachers: But like it was a given that the bar is high.
[00:37:52] Margit Wennmachers: Well, that's, you know, that's such a good point because one of the things that we always get asked because Grace did such a nice job of marketing the book is well, like how do you market your book?
[00:38:03] Ben Horowitz: And I'm like, well, look, you can do, there's like well-known marketing ideas and so forth.
[00:38:09] Ben Horowitz: And you can do a lot of things.
[00:38:10] Ben Horowitz: And you can get yourself even on like the best seller list.
[00:38:14] Ben Horowitz: But then the book's going to disappear unless it's a great book.
[00:38:18] Ben Horowitz: Right.
[00:38:19] Ben Horowitz: Like it has to be good.
[00:38:20] Ben Horowitz: Right.
[00:38:21] Ben Horowitz: Like that's the fundamental thing.
[00:38:22] Ben Horowitz: And so like if you don't write something that's good, if you're completely focused on like how you promote it before you've written it, like that's probably about that.
[00:38:30] Ben Horowitz: That's backwards.
[00:38:31] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:38:32] Ben Horowitz: You have to actually believe that you have an idea that that's worth putting a book like a book has to stand the test of time.
[00:38:41] Margit Wennmachers: You know, I mean, it has to be an actual thing versus a tweet.
[00:38:44] Margit Wennmachers: Well, some of you people in business take a blog post idea, a blog post length idea and they try and turn it into a book and.
[00:38:53] Some things are just a snack.
[00:38:54] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah, there's snacks and snacks should be snacks.
[00:38:56] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:38:57] Margit Wennmachers: Exactly.
[00:38:58] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah, I know.
[00:38:59] Margit Wennmachers: I thought the book served you well.
[00:39:01] Margit Wennmachers: And I think it made it made everybody in the firm go like, oh, like I don't know that Andrew, would he have thought automatically walking in here?
[00:39:10] Margit Wennmachers: It's like, well, maybe I should write a book.
[00:39:11] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:39:12] Margit Wennmachers: Like and it just made it open up the thinking I think for everybody else.
[00:39:16] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:39:17] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:39:18] Ben Horowitz: And you know, a good thing about you also learn a lot when you write a book.
[00:39:21] Ben Horowitz: So I think everybody's it's at the standard of.
[00:39:26] You can't just have an idea here.
[00:39:28] Ben Horowitz: You have to be able to really think of through be able to articulate it, be able to write it, be able to publish it.
[00:39:34] Ben Horowitz: And otherwise like your idea didn't count.
[00:39:37] Ben Horowitz: And that that I think has helped us a lot as a.
[00:39:41] Ben Horowitz: Yeah, I mean, look at Catherine Boyle.
[00:39:43] Margit Wennmachers: I mean, she came in with the pitch of like, if I work here, I'm going to do American dynamism and here's what that is.
[00:39:49] Margit Wennmachers: And like, she also happens to be a gifted communicator.
[00:39:53] Margit Wennmachers: And now it's, you know, it was a deck.
[00:39:56] Margit Wennmachers: That's a movement and a fund.
[00:39:59] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:40:00] Margit Wennmachers: And like, it's helping really change the way people think about the fence tech.
[00:40:03] Margit Wennmachers: This ball was sent out.
[00:40:05] Margit Wennmachers: Remember back in the day, Diane Green was out of it from Google for like a very innocent contract.
[00:40:10] Margit Wennmachers: Look at pictures.
[00:40:11] Margit Wennmachers: I mean, it's like, well, it's right.
[00:40:13] Margit Wennmachers: And that like and Catherine played a replay is playing a really big role in turning that around.
[00:40:18] Margit Wennmachers: Right.
[00:40:19] Margit Wennmachers: And that's an idea.
[00:40:20] Yeah.
[00:40:21] Ben Horowitz: So, no, for sure.
[00:40:22] Ben Horowitz: I, it is a, you know, I hadn't actually thought about it that much, but it's a very important part.
[00:40:29] Ben Horowitz: It's like marketing, original marketing ideas turned into kind of a very important cultural point of the firm, which is, you know, like this is how we work.
[00:40:39] Ben Horowitz: This how we think.
[00:40:40] Ben Horowitz: I mean, sometimes it was so overdone, like a new person comes in.
[00:40:44] Margit Wennmachers: The first thing they want to do is meet with marketing.
[00:40:47] Do you know where you're sitting?
[00:40:48] Margit Wennmachers: And then, and then I was like, I literally have had people say like, you should really think about me.
[00:40:53] Margit Wennmachers: Like, you should think about Mark and Jason.
[00:40:55] And I was like, keep what are your thoughts?
[00:40:57] Margit Wennmachers: I know exactly who that was, but I'm not going to say no.
[00:41:00] Ben Horowitz: And it's all well intentioned, but like you do, you do have to test the actual idea, right?
[00:41:06] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:41:07] Margit Wennmachers: Is that a snack?
[00:41:08] Margit Wennmachers: Is that a book?
[00:41:09] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:41:10] Margit Wennmachers: Is it just a conversation?
[00:41:11] Like, they need to be calibrated properly, right?
[00:41:14] Margit Wennmachers: And sometimes young people who are incredibly ambitious, that was me, Stilas, like you just want to go right for the win.
[00:41:21] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:41:22] Margit Wennmachers: But you need to make sure you have the goods to do it.
[00:41:24] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:41:25] Ben Horowitz: Well, this, this kind of gets into a conversation, Mark and I have been having, which is, you know, the marketing of companies has changed so much.
[00:41:33] Ben Horowitz: Because you're really now marketing a person.
[00:41:37] Ben Horowitz: And that's a lot what we did at the firm now, because the firm had our name.
[00:41:41] Ben Horowitz: It was a natural.
[00:41:42] Ben Horowitz: Also, we don't have products.
[00:41:44] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:41:45] Ben Horowitz: And we have products.
[00:41:46] Ben Horowitz: We have people and ideas.
[00:41:47] Margit Wennmachers: That's it.
[00:41:48] Ben Horowitz: But that's extended now to, you know, is it, is it Tesla or is it Elon?
[00:41:54] Ben Horowitz: Is it Palantir or is it Alex?
[00:41:56] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:41:57] Ben Horowitz: And the, in order to be able to do that, like you can be an extremely accomplished person who is not interested.
[00:42:06] Ben Horowitz: Like those don't necessarily go together.
[00:42:08] Ben Horowitz: And I think that's a little bit unfair from the press or like it creates this perception that Silicon Valley is staffed entirely with weirdos.
[00:42:17] Margit Wennmachers: Right.
[00:42:18] Margit Wennmachers: They're more interesting to write about.
[00:42:19] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:42:20] Margit Wennmachers: Somebody who goes to work every day and drives an Audi and is a good father and drops kid off at school.
[00:42:26] Margit Wennmachers: That's all nice.
[00:42:27] Margit Wennmachers: Like I'll pick on someone, right?
[00:42:29] Margit Wennmachers: Like Dylan Field.
[00:42:31] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:42:32] Margit Wennmachers: Most amazing guy built an incredible company.
[00:42:34] Margit Wennmachers: I hosted Dennis with him.
[00:42:36] Margit Wennmachers: He's just normal.
[00:42:38] Well, just that the weirdest thing about him is that the Teal fellowship.
[00:42:42] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:42:43] Margit Wennmachers: But like those don't get written up as much.
[00:42:45] Margit Wennmachers: The weirdos, like the weirder, the better, right?
[00:42:48] Margit Wennmachers: Like and it's gotten to an extreme where it's like this is actually not reflecting Silicon Valley.
[00:42:53] Margit Wennmachers: It's just a slice of it.
[00:42:56] Margit Wennmachers: Well, it's an interesting marketing conundrum though, because you can't market a company.
[00:43:03] Ben Horowitz: If you don't have a character, right?
[00:43:05] Ben Horowitz: Like like, no, you used to look, yeah, there used to be companies and it was fine.
[00:43:12] Margit Wennmachers: What all you do is you report your financial results, you announce your new products.
[00:43:18] Margit Wennmachers: And that kind of started to end with Steve Jobs because it was a show.
[00:43:22] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah, that's right.
[00:43:23] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:43:24] Margit Wennmachers: And he made you want a product.
[00:43:25] Margit Wennmachers: That's right.
[00:43:26] Margit Wennmachers: Like it became, it's almost like politics adjacent.
[00:43:29] Margit Wennmachers: Like you can't vote for a party of voting for a person.
[00:43:32] Margit Wennmachers: Right.
[00:43:33] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:43:34] Margit Wennmachers: And if you have the company, but not a character or a sense of character, it just doesn't work.
[00:43:39] Margit Wennmachers: And then, you know, the corporate ex accounts and all of that, those are all fine.
[00:43:44] Margit Wennmachers: But like at the end of the day, it's the identity of the person.
[00:43:47] Margit Wennmachers: And do they actually sound like does the tree sound like Mark, right?
[00:43:51] Margit Wennmachers: Like does the LinkedIn posts sound like DG or whatever it is?
[00:43:56] Margit Wennmachers: Like you cannot disconnect it anymore.
[00:43:58] Margit Wennmachers: Right.
[00:43:59] Margit Wennmachers: And then, like, if you have a place, it's a premium on people who are willing to play character or be character.
[00:44:05] I'm not sure that's always the healthiest thing for a company at every, at every stage, right?
[00:44:11] Margit Wennmachers: Or in every situation.
[00:44:13] Margit Wennmachers: Like there are some downsides to it, but the upside beats the downside, like 10 to 1 or whatever the right number.
[00:44:20] Ben Horowitz: It requires a lot of discipline, I think, from the founder, because it turns you into like this mini celebrity.
[00:44:29] Ben Horowitz: And so as a mini celebrity, can you like be out there and not act like an actual celebrity?
[00:44:38] Ben Horowitz: Because those aren't great organizational dynamics just having been around, you know, many celebrities, although.
[00:44:46] Ben Horowitz: And the thing is.
[00:44:47] Ben Horowitz: I was notwithstanding he's a very regular person in that kind of thing.
[00:44:52] Ben Horowitz: Yeah, he's surprising.
[00:44:53] Ben Horowitz: But he's very surprising. He's very unusual.
[00:44:55] Ben Horowitz: But he also has an amazing product.
[00:44:57] Yeah.
[00:44:58] Ben Horowitz: It's hard to argue with.
[00:44:59] Ben Horowitz: So like being able to be like this interesting character on the outside and then come in and, you know, me.
[00:45:06] Ben Horowitz: Well, just be somebody who you can have an actual conversation with where you can get information and not be this thing that you put yourself on a pedestal to the point where people are.
[00:45:16] Ben Horowitz: And that kind of stuff is very destructive in a company.
[00:45:19] Ben Horowitz: Yeah, I think there's some there's some downside along those lines.
[00:45:23] Margit Wennmachers: And the other part is like, you can't really fake that stuff.
[00:45:27] Margit Wennmachers: If you have a public persona and it's not real and it's all manicured, like does does not work.
[00:45:35] Margit Wennmachers: It won't work over time.
[00:45:37] Margit Wennmachers: Right. So you kind of have to lean.
[00:45:40] Margit Wennmachers: And like this is what I was trying to do is lean into like, who is this person?
[00:45:45] Margit Wennmachers: And what are they good at that they can sustain over time?
[00:45:48] Margit Wennmachers: Like you make anybody do a TED talk if you really, really are hellbent on doing it.
[00:45:52] Margit Wennmachers: But like that's not an actual marketing campaign.
[00:45:55] Margit Wennmachers: That's not a personal brand.
[00:45:57] Margit Wennmachers: You have to really figure out, okay, who is this person?
[00:46:00] Margit Wennmachers: What are their dynamics?
[00:46:01] Margit Wennmachers: What are their talents that they can actually be not act, but like actually be.
[00:46:06] Margit Wennmachers: I think it's hard to actually be a character and a TED talk.
[00:46:09] Ben Horowitz: You know, with the people who do TED talks, aren't characters.
[00:46:12] Ben Horowitz: Yeah, I mean, a TED talk.
[00:46:14] Ben Horowitz: You've never done a TED talk.
[00:46:15] Ben Horowitz: I've never done a TED talk.
[00:46:17] Ben Horowitz: I think it's hard to do both.
[00:46:18] Ben Horowitz: I've never watched a TED talk.
[00:46:19] Marc Andreessen: You've never watched a TED talk.
[00:46:20] I've never watched a TED talk.
[00:46:21] Ben Horowitz: Oh man.
[00:46:22] Ben Horowitz: You heard me singing out on that very beautifully package.
[00:46:25] Ben Horowitz: It's almost like my point.
[00:46:26] Ben Horowitz: But that is my point.
[00:46:27] Ben Horowitz: My point is that is exactly my point.
[00:46:30] Margit Wennmachers: TED talks are these very manicured things that like work for a minute.
[00:46:38] Margit Wennmachers: But again, nobody who's seen so many TED talks is like, this is all the same.
[00:46:41] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah, that's all the exact same plastic, right?
[00:46:44] Margit Wennmachers: Or maybe you think it's platinum, but it's exact same formulaic thing.
[00:46:48] Margit Wennmachers: That's not an actual brand.
[00:46:50] Margit Wennmachers: That's maybe an event that if you really care about it, because some people really care about that shit.
[00:46:54] Margit Wennmachers: But like that's not actually who you are.
[00:46:56] Margit Wennmachers: They read to me as religious servants.
[00:46:59] Marc Andreessen: And I have an aversion to fake religions.
[00:47:01] Marc Andreessen: They're all more out there.
[00:47:02] Marc Andreessen: They're all more a little more.
[00:47:03] Marc Andreessen: Yeah, they're a little more at morality stories.
[00:47:04] Marc Andreessen: They've all got a message.
[00:47:06] Marc Andreessen: And it's like the very special episodes of TV shows in the 1970s.
[00:47:09] Marc Andreessen: They were the very special episodes where you like learn about.
[00:47:11] Marc Andreessen: Yeah, very special, happy day.
[00:47:12] Marc Andreessen: You learn about drug addiction or yeah.
[00:47:14] Marc Andreessen: And the thing is, I'm in marketing.
[00:47:17] Margit Wennmachers: And I find them saccharine.
[00:47:19] Margit Wennmachers: Like they're just too, they're just too perfect in a way, right?
[00:47:22] Margit Wennmachers: And they train you like crazy.
[00:47:25] Margit Wennmachers: And then, you know, they're the teams that peel off of Ted.
[00:47:27] Margit Wennmachers: And then they help executives be great.
[00:47:30] Margit Wennmachers: And you can just, I've talked to them.
[00:47:32] Margit Wennmachers: And I'm like, like, you know, you've been invited to to podcast that are produced that way.
[00:47:38] Margit Wennmachers: And they literally are trying to script what you're going to say.
[00:47:42] Margit Wennmachers: And I'm like, we don't do that.
[00:47:43] Margit Wennmachers: Back to the start.
[00:47:44] Margit Wennmachers: Yes.
[00:47:45] Margit Wennmachers: And that's why that's why I'm saying that's why I'm rafting a little bit is because like my instincts are all to the exact opposite of that.
[00:47:50] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:47:51] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:47:52] Marc Andreessen: As you know, which is like authenticity and rawness.
[00:47:54] Marc Andreessen: When you could do a TED talk, I think you'd be fine at it.
[00:47:56] Marc Andreessen: But it's actually not you.
[00:47:57] Margit Wennmachers: And like, therefore, it wouldn't accrue to the brand.
[00:48:00] Margit Wennmachers: He could not do a TED talk because in order to do a TED talk, they have to review what you're going to say.
[00:48:05] Ben Horowitz: And they have to edit it.
[00:48:06] Ben Horowitz: And there's no chance.
[00:48:09] Ben Horowitz: Now what I'm saying is if he decided he wanted to do something.
[00:48:12] Margit Wennmachers: Like if I had something Mark writes, like, I take one sentence and I give one word.
[00:48:17] Ben Horowitz: And then that's as much as he likes to be edited.
[00:48:20] Ben Horowitz: This is why I find it so hilarious when you send around like when you used to do that.
[00:48:23] Margit Wennmachers: You send around the blog post and then everybody is so eager to edit them.
[00:48:26] Margit Wennmachers: And I'm like, this is such a waste of time.
[00:48:28] Margit Wennmachers: This is like, it's not you.
[00:48:31] Margit Wennmachers: It's like not you.
[00:48:32] Margit Wennmachers: So that's why you revised me my favorite thing that Larry David said.
[00:48:35] Ben Horowitz: The rule on Seinfeld was no hugs and no lessons.
[00:48:38] Ben Horowitz: No, it's not.
[00:48:39] Ben Horowitz: Exactly.
[00:48:40] Ben Horowitz: That's right.
[00:48:41] Ben Horowitz: It's a very special office.
[00:48:42] Ben Horowitz: That's what made that.
[00:48:43] Ben Horowitz: That's what made that show so distinctive.
[00:48:44] Marc Andreessen: They never did that.
[00:48:45] Marc Andreessen: They never.
[00:48:46] Marc Andreessen: It was never it was never modeling or sacra.
[00:48:48] Marc Andreessen: Never.
[00:48:49] Marc Andreessen: It was like almost making that way.
[00:48:50] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:48:51] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:48:52] Margit Wennmachers: It's a very, very good show.
[00:48:53] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:48:54] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:48:55] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:48:56] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:48:57] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:48:58] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:48:59] Margit Wennmachers: And look, that is great.
[00:49:00] Margit Wennmachers: Like I'm not trying to align it.
[00:49:01] Margit Wennmachers: It's like it's it's very manufactured.
[00:49:02] Margit Wennmachers: And I don't think that's an actual brand as a person you can't be that brand.
[00:49:05] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:49:06] Marc Andreessen: The thing that works is well, and you know, a lot of this just has to do with the shifting technological environment.
[00:49:09] Marc Andreessen: Yes.
[00:49:10] Marc Andreessen: But the thing that works in this media environment is much more much more authenticity and trust.
[00:49:14] Marc Andreessen: Do you think about it if you look at like a juiceman?
[00:49:16] Margit Wennmachers: Well, authenticity and originality.
[00:49:17] Ben Horowitz: Right.
[00:49:18] Ben Horowitz: So the.
[00:49:19] Marc Andreessen: Interestingness.
[00:49:20] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:49:21] Ben Horowitz: Which is interesting because the old world like our media training in the old world was all like much is the opposite.
[00:49:25] Ben Horowitz: It was conformist.
[00:49:26] Ben Horowitz: Stan message.
[00:49:27] Ben Horowitz: Discipline discipline discipline discipline.
[00:49:29] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:49:30] Ben Horowitz: And not the window.
[00:49:31] Ben Horowitz: And the thing that I think what's interesting to media and that's what media has to figure out is.
[00:49:35] Margit Wennmachers: They used to set the tone.
[00:49:37] Margit Wennmachers: Right.
[00:49:38] Margit Wennmachers: And now they're at the very end.
[00:49:39] Margit Wennmachers: Right.
[00:49:40] Margit Wennmachers: At the very end of all the stuff that's been said on Twitter or.
[00:49:43] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:49:44] Margit Wennmachers: And then media is like, Oh, what is this thing?
[00:49:47] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:49:48] Margit Wennmachers: But I'm not talking about the Rogan show.
[00:49:50] Margit Wennmachers: But I get it's at the very end right.
[00:49:52] Margit Wennmachers: And that's like for media, it must be total out of our body experience where it was like, wait.
[00:49:56] Margit Wennmachers: Like I was the, I was the beginning right when you were when you were unveiling something.
[00:50:01] Margit Wennmachers: That's where you would go.
[00:50:03] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:50:04] Ben Horowitz: Right.
[00:50:05] Margit Wennmachers: And now you can go any freaking place that like you have 50,000 choices, right?
[00:50:09] Margit Wennmachers: And then it gets enough steam and then it gets reviewed by media almost.
[00:50:13] Margit Wennmachers: Right.
[00:50:14] Margit Wennmachers: It's just that the order has flipped completely.
[00:50:16] Margit Wennmachers: It makes it very tricky to speak to the media because when they're on that end and they have to turn you into news.
[00:50:27] Anything you say can and will be used against you.
[00:50:30] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:50:31] Ben Horowitz: You know, it's a very Miranda type world.
[00:50:33] Marc Andreessen: My new version of this, my new test, I think is happening is what we might call the GPT test, which is okay.
[00:50:38] Marc Andreessen: If what somebody says is indistinguishable from chat GPT output, like not going to make it.
[00:50:44] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:50:45] Marc Andreessen: Right.
[00:50:46] Marc Andreessen: And then the more advanced version of the test is like, is it indistinguishable from like chat GPT 3.5?
[00:50:51] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:50:52] Marc Andreessen: Right.
[00:50:53] Marc Andreessen: Which is like nothing, which is like the earlier version.
[00:50:56] Marc Andreessen: That sounds good.
[00:50:57] Marc Andreessen: And the number of public figures in various domains who continue to speak in public or put out crafted, you know, whatever.
[00:51:04] Marc Andreessen: And literally you're just like, this is indistinguishable from what the LM could do.
[00:51:09] Marc Andreessen: Or by the way, columnists, people are kind of calm for living.
[00:51:12] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:51:13] Marc Andreessen: Like there's a lot of people who don't pass that test.
[00:51:16] Marc Andreessen: And so I just say that there's going to be a big, big turnover there.
[00:51:20] Marc Andreessen: And then, and then it begs the important question like, okay, what does it take to pass that test?
[00:51:24] Marc Andreessen: Right.
[00:51:25] Marc Andreessen: Right.
[00:51:26] Marc Andreessen: Like how many?
[00:51:27] Marc Andreessen: While it's changing all the time.
[00:51:28] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah, also true, right.
[00:51:29] Marc Andreessen: Exactly.
[00:51:30] Marc Andreessen: And then the version is actually, I discovered a version of the conversation with Tyler Cohen one time.
[00:51:34] Marc Andreessen: So Tyler Cohen is and his partner Alex have been blogging daily for over 20 years.
[00:51:37] Marc Andreessen: And the team is amazing.
[00:51:38] Marc Andreessen: And they do a great job.
[00:51:40] Marc Andreessen: And then their leaders have like these, you know, the influential movement.
[00:51:43] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:51:44] Marc Andreessen: Incredibly important.
[00:51:45] Marc Andreessen: And like all these things and they're in all these rooms that they, you know, they will say this like it's put them in all these incredibly important rooms.
[00:51:50] Marc Andreessen: And all these things and I was like, wow, it's worked so great for you guys.
[00:51:52] Marc Andreessen: It's like, why don't, you know, why don't more people do this?
[00:51:54] Marc Andreessen: And Tyler just like last.
[00:51:55] Marc Andreessen: And he's like, Mark, how many people have something to say every day?
[00:51:58] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:51:59] Marc Andreessen: Right.
[00:52:00] Marc Andreessen: Right.
[00:52:01] Marc Andreessen: Well, genuinely, like how many people have that?
[00:52:02] Marc Andreessen: And then, you know, every day for 20 years is like maybe the highest bar.
[00:52:05] Marc Andreessen: But how many people have, you know, three interesting things to say or one interesting thing to say.
[00:52:09] Marc Andreessen: But this is where this is my beef with some of these platforms.
[00:52:12] Margit Wennmachers: Right.
[00:52:13] Margit Wennmachers: Or actually, it's the humans.
[00:52:14] Margit Wennmachers: It's not the platforms.
[00:52:15] Margit Wennmachers: It's always the humans.
[00:52:16] Margit Wennmachers: Right.
[00:52:17] Margit Wennmachers: Or like does every thought that you have need to go on X or wherever it needs to go.
[00:52:23] Margit Wennmachers: I would beg to differ.
[00:52:24] Margit Wennmachers: But like a lot of people, now a lot of people were like, okay, it's a new day.
[00:52:28] Margit Wennmachers: I got to say something.
[00:52:29] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:52:30] Margit Wennmachers: And like, I don't know.
[00:52:31] Margit Wennmachers: Well, to me, let me ask you this though.
[00:52:33] Marc Andreessen: Would you agree that the differences if they have an interesting thought every day, that's one thing.
[00:52:37] Marc Andreessen: Fantastic.
[00:52:38] Marc Andreessen: Right.
[00:52:39] Marc Andreessen: Right.
[00:52:40] Marc Andreessen: The more the mayor.
[00:52:41] Marc Andreessen: Right.
[00:52:42] Marc Andreessen: But yeah, most people don't.
[00:52:43] Margit Wennmachers: But like most people don't.
[00:52:44] Margit Wennmachers: And I sort of feel like they would be better.
[00:52:45] Margit Wennmachers: They would be better.
[00:52:46] Margit Wennmachers: They don't always.
[00:52:47] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:52:48] Ben Horowitz: They would better serve to like pop up when they have a thought or contribute something to the conversation.
[00:52:54] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:52:55] Margit Wennmachers: That's.
[00:52:56] Margit Wennmachers: I don't know.
[00:52:57] Margit Wennmachers: I just don't think that everybody has interesting things to say every day.
[00:53:00] Margit Wennmachers: Oh, I mean, I'm here.
[00:53:01] Margit Wennmachers: Yes.
[00:53:02] Margit Wennmachers: That's right.
[00:53:03] Margit Wennmachers: Look at X.
[00:53:04] Margit Wennmachers: I see proof.
[00:53:05] Margit Wennmachers: Well, my theory at least is the nature of leadership is changing because of everything you
[00:53:08] Marc Andreessen: guys have discussed.
[00:53:09] Marc Andreessen: The nature of leadership is changing.
[00:53:10] Marc Andreessen: And the leader, the people, the leaders who have very large number of interesting things to say,
[00:53:15] Marc Andreessen: I know how to communicate it, are going to do disproportionately well in the years ahead.
[00:53:18] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:53:19] Marc Andreessen: And the leaders who don't, even if they're professionally skilled, I think are going to have a harder,
[00:53:22] Marc Andreessen: harder time.
[00:53:23] Marc Andreessen: And their companies are going to have a harder, harder time because it's just the old, the old
[00:53:25] Marc Andreessen: methods they're just not working as well anymore.
[00:53:26] Marc Andreessen: No.
[00:53:27] Ben Horowitz: Well, particularly on the, on the marketing front.
[00:53:30] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:53:31] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:53:32] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:53:33] Ben Horowitz: And, you know, like, but people are changing.
[00:53:34] Ben Horowitz: Like, it's been interesting to watch our friend Mark Zuckerberg kind of changes public personas
[00:53:42] Ben Horowitz: so much.
[00:53:43] Ben Horowitz: So great.
[00:53:44] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:53:45] Margit Wennmachers: I mean, so he's kind of, I mean, running a gigantic social media company.
[00:53:50] Ben Horowitz: And he would, thank you, would figure it out.
[00:53:51] Ben Horowitz: But I guess, but it's still very difficult to do.
[00:53:53] Ben Horowitz: And it actually mapped to a journal change.
[00:53:55] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:53:56] Ben Horowitz: Like he himself changed.
[00:53:57] Ben Horowitz: Yes.
[00:53:58] Marc Andreessen: It wasn't like a synthetically generated.
[00:53:59] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:54:00] Marc Andreessen: It's like it's every, everything of like Mark Zuckerberg and public now is, you know, a hundred
[00:54:04] Marc Andreessen: percent Holy Authentic.
[00:54:05] Marc Andreessen: He used to try to calculate what he was going to say through the lens of all his many, many
[00:54:13] Ben Horowitz: constituents.
[00:54:14] Ben Horowitz: And now he's saying what he thinks.
[00:54:15] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:54:16] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:54:17] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:54:18] Marc Andreessen: He received the A plus grade version of that training from people who were world class
[00:54:22] Marc Andreessen: at that.
[00:54:23] Marc Andreessen: Right.
[00:54:24] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:54:25] Marc Andreessen: And it worked for a while.
[00:54:26] Marc Andreessen: And then the environment changed.
[00:54:27] Margit Wennmachers: But I also think he, whoever was like, like, overdidic.
[00:54:29] Margit Wennmachers: I remember being in your office.
[00:54:30] Margit Wennmachers: And it was like, that man has the wrong beer somewhere.
[00:54:33] Margit Wennmachers: It's a scandal because it was so perfect.
[00:54:35] Margit Wennmachers: Right.
[00:54:36] Margit Wennmachers: So crafty.
[00:54:37] Margit Wennmachers: And it was like chill out.
[00:54:38] Margit Wennmachers: It was so tight.
[00:54:39] Margit Wennmachers: Well, you know what it was.
[00:54:40] Margit Wennmachers: And then he did, now that he's doing it, like, this is me deal with it.
[00:54:42] Margit Wennmachers: It's working great.
[00:54:43] Margit Wennmachers: And again, the people who trained, you know, people who trained in Marlach supergeniuses
[00:54:46] Marc Andreessen: and they were fantastic.
[00:54:47] Marc Andreessen: But they themselves were trained in what I would describe as like 1980s, 1990s style politics.
[00:54:51] Marc Andreessen: They came out of a political background, right, which is even more intense version of
[00:54:56] Marc Andreessen: everything that we're talking about.
[00:54:57] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:54:58] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:54:59] Marc Andreessen: So they got trained.
[00:55:00] Marc Andreessen: They got trained the way politicians got trained in the 1990s, which was extremely scripted and controlled,
[00:55:04] Marc Andreessen: like, maximally so.
[00:55:05] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:55:06] Marc Andreessen: And so, and then just the, as we've just, like, just this massive shift in the environment since then,
[00:55:11] Marc Andreessen: basically rendered, I mean, you see this playing out.
[00:55:13] Marc Andreessen: I think it's done a great job.
[00:55:15] Marc Andreessen: And so, you know, having a lot of things to do with the world, right, which is this is also,
[00:55:18] Marc Andreessen: everything we're talking about is also playing out politically, and maybe even more so politically.
[00:55:21] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:55:22] Ben Horowitz: And it's even, like, the subtle things have been the most interesting to me.
[00:55:25] Ben Horowitz: So he used to be known for, like, he's always growing a hoodie, which was the most conformist
[00:55:30] Ben Horowitz: thing in the world in Silicon Valley, right?
[00:55:32] Ben Horowitz: I know.
[00:55:33] Ben Horowitz: And now, like, he's got, like, the gold chains and this hair all over the, you know, and it's kind of,
[00:55:38] Ben Horowitz: like, he's expressing himself on all fronts.
[00:55:42] Ben Horowitz: But really, I was just saying what he looks like in private.
[00:55:44] Ben Horowitz: Like, it's now, now it all matches.
[00:55:46] Marc Andreessen: But I see it.
[00:55:47] Marc Andreessen: It's been great to kind of see him flower like that and be able to, like, fully express himself.
[00:55:50] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:55:51] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:55:52] Marc Andreessen: And still people are like, well, what's with the gold chains?
[00:55:55] Margit Wennmachers: I'm like, he likes them.
[00:55:57] Marc Andreessen: Well, here's an executive.
[00:55:59] Marc Andreessen: The main one that he wears has a real, it's important with his faith.
[00:56:03] Marc Andreessen: Oh, yeah.
[00:56:04] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:56:05] Marc Andreessen: There's a guy who runs a ginormous company that's in the spotlight all the time.
[00:56:09] Margit Wennmachers: And like, this is what you're picking on.
[00:56:10] Margit Wennmachers: I'm like, yes.
[00:56:11] Margit Wennmachers: Hello.
[00:56:12] Margit Wennmachers: I'm also true.
[00:56:13] Ben Horowitz: But it's, I think when people from the old world see that it makes them very uncomfortable.
[00:56:19] Ben Horowitz: Right?
[00:56:20] Ben Horowitz: One of, okay, one of the guys who was doing what we wanted him to is no longer, he's off the
[00:56:26] Ben Horowitz: lead.
[00:56:27] Marc Andreessen: No, the program.
[00:56:28] That's right.
[00:56:29] Marc Andreessen: Well, he's liberated.
[00:56:30] Margit Wennmachers: We go all the way back to when, when, what's his name?
[00:56:32] Margit Wennmachers: The found Dennis from For Square.
[00:56:34] He got yelled at because he went to a press meeting with a hoodie on, like, all the way
[00:56:39] Margit Wennmachers: at the beginning.
[00:56:40] I remember that.
[00:56:42] Margit Wennmachers: I remember that.
[00:56:43] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:56:44] Margit Wennmachers: He was like, I think, and he had a banana or something like that.
[00:56:46] Margit Wennmachers: It was like, apparently, entirely unacceptable.
[00:56:49] Margit Wennmachers: Right.
[00:56:50] Margit Wennmachers: It's almost makes it nostalgic.
[00:56:52] Margit Wennmachers: Very interesting.
[00:56:53] Marc Andreessen: I mean, like, I think all this stuff, I'm obvious, all this stuff is going to intensify.
[00:56:56] Marc Andreessen: I think every successful company, I think every successful company, the future is going
[00:57:00] Marc Andreessen: to need this kind of personality.
[00:57:01] Marc Andreessen: They need somebody who can do this.
[00:57:03] Marc Andreessen: And it's a different leadership profile.
[00:57:05] Marc Andreessen: Do you think it has to be the CEO?
[00:57:06] Margit Wennmachers: I think it's really hard for it not to be.
[00:57:09] Marc Andreessen: I mean, maybe, maybe it could be another founder, I think.
[00:57:12] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:57:13] Marc Andreessen: I wonder what it could do.
[00:57:14] Ben Horowitz: Yeah, co-founder.
[00:57:15] Ben Horowitz: For sure, if you're a consumer brand, I think it's very difficult to not have a person like
[00:57:21] Ben Horowitz: that.
[00:57:22] Ben Horowitz: I think, you know, if you're less marketing, like, if you are, like, if the, I mean,
[00:57:27] Ben Horowitz: there are historically businesses that are all sales.
[00:57:30] Ben Horowitz: I think, but I think if you're in a competitive situation, and on the other side, there's
[00:57:34] Margit Wennmachers: somebody who's really good at it.
[00:57:35] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:57:36] Margit Wennmachers: It's still sucks.
[00:57:37] Margit Wennmachers: If you sell security stuff, it's not a price, you know, government as it gets.
[00:57:41] Marc Andreessen: Oh, yeah.
[00:57:42] Marc Andreessen: No, it's killing it.
[00:57:43] Marc Andreessen: It's killing it.
[00:57:44] Marc Andreessen: He's perfect.
[00:57:45] Marc Andreessen: Imagine being a competitor to a palanter and not having an Alex, right?
[00:57:48] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:57:49] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:57:50] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:57:51] Marc Andreessen: Even just the stock market valuation alone, like, how can you possibly keep up?
[00:57:53] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:57:54] Marc Andreessen: It's basically, can you sell in the way you're selling today's entirely different?
[00:57:58] Margit Wennmachers: Yeah.
[00:57:59] Margit Wennmachers: Right?
[00:58:00] Margit Wennmachers: Like, it's not, you know, having features and garden reports just like.
[00:58:03] Margit Wennmachers: I think it's great.
[00:58:04] Marc Andreessen: I think it's, I think it's, I think it's leading to a more honest world.
[00:58:06] Marc Andreessen: Like, more transparent, more authentic, more honest, more interesting things we've discussed,
[00:58:11] Marc Andreessen: more interesting issues getting surfaced, people actually getting to know each other.
[00:58:13] Marc Andreessen: Yeah, it's a much less sanitized world.
[00:58:15] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:58:16] Ben Horowitz: That's right.
[00:58:17] Marc Andreessen: And of course, that, that, it's uncomfortable because if you used to, if you used to the,
[00:58:20] Marc Andreessen: you know, the, the, you know, the ones that say the wall garden, if you used to sanitize
[00:58:23] Marc Andreessen: environment, if you used to Disneyland entering the real world is traumatic.
[00:58:26] Marc Andreessen: Very, very, very, but like we do live in the real world, right?
[00:58:29] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:58:30] Marc Andreessen: And as always, it's the transition that's the toughest part.
[00:58:33] Margit Wennmachers: It's going like, oh, this is all different now, right?
[00:58:35] Margit Wennmachers: And, and I think we're in a really big transition and the transition is transition.
[00:58:40] Margit Wennmachers: It's a reflection.
[00:58:41] Margit Wennmachers: It's like, it's right.
[00:58:42] Marc Andreessen: It was still the middle of it, like it's over yet.
[00:58:43] Marc Andreessen: Yeah.
[00:58:44] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:58:45] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:58:46] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:58:47] Yeah.
[00:58:48] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:58:49] Margit Wennmachers: All right.
[00:58:50] Margit Wennmachers: Well, we're going to keep going.
[00:58:51] Ben Horowitz: Yeah.
[00:58:52] Ben Horowitz: Fantastic.
