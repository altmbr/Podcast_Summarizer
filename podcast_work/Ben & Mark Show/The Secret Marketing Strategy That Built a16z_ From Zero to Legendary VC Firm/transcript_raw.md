[00:00:00] I cause a lot of antagonism between us and the other firms and mouth stays.
[00:00:03] SPEAKER_00: Your filter is like, you're gonna get the deal or I'm gonna get the deal.
[00:00:07] SPEAKER_02: You die or I die.
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_02: And they're not exactly shrinking about what's themselves.
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_00: They hated that cover story.
[00:00:12] SPEAKER_00: Like it in one of the cover of the magazine.
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_00: That's not supposed to be him.
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_00: Not supposed to be the entrepreneur.
[00:00:18] SPEAKER_00: With the hell that it is.
[00:00:19] SPEAKER_00: I mean, they just like,
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_00: what's the reason we didn't have any reverse for the stuff.
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it is.
[00:00:25] SPEAKER_00: The C was like a big secret.
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_00: And then actually building companies was a big secret.
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_00: And so just kind of talking about it was a big differentiator.
[00:00:33] SPEAKER_00: We don't have products.
[00:00:34] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and we have products.
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_00: We have people and ideas. That's it.
[00:00:43] All right, welcome to the A16C.
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_00: What are we on?
[00:00:47] SPEAKER_00: The Mark and Ben show.
[00:00:47] SPEAKER_00: Welcome to the Mark and Ben show.
[00:00:50] Today we've got Mark and Gwen Markers, the legendary head of marketing for
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_00: A16Z for the last 16 years.
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_00: And she is going to tell us the story of all that.
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_00: You've heard snippets of it from me and Mark over the years.
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_00: But now we're going to hear the real thing from the real person market.
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_00: Welcome.
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_00: Thank you so much for having me, guys.
[00:01:12] SPEAKER_02: I'm thrilled to be here.
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_02: But between the legendary and the 15 or 16, I feel kind of anxious.
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_02: Why?
[00:01:18] SPEAKER_02: Why?
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_02: Why?
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_00: No, it's getting us all.
[00:01:22] SPEAKER_00: It's very rough.
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_00: I know.
[00:01:24] SPEAKER_00: It just a bitch that way.
[00:01:26] So maybe we can start with just like when we met.
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_00: Maybe I'd love to hear it from your perspective.
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_00: OK.
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_00: So we're here.
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_00: Hobies or I think we're going to be sort of the stats.
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_00: The creamery.
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_00: The creamery.
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_00: The creamery.
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_00: That one was your off.
[00:01:41] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:01:42] SPEAKER_00: And so I, I forgot the firm started at the creamery.
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_00: That's right.
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_02: So I was, a certain someone who shall go nameless, tried to hire outcast.
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_02: And Facebook invoked a conflict of interest.
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_02: You know exactly who that is, right?
[00:02:00] SPEAKER_02: And so that certain someone called Mark and said,
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_02: just call Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:02:04] SPEAKER_02: And I think you had better things to do
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_02: than like pull a favor from Mark Zuckerberg to go like,
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_02: why don't you like this, whatever.
[00:02:10] SPEAKER_02: Anyhow.
[00:02:10] SPEAKER_02: But I think you asked for my email address.
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_02: And so that's how we were introduced.
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_00: And then I was told to go to the creamery, the waiter,
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_02: at the creamery.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_02: He's like, go be here.
[00:02:22] SPEAKER_02: They're meeting with some democratic functionaries.
[00:02:24] SPEAKER_02: Or something like that.
[00:02:26] SPEAKER_02: So I went there with my little capabilities presentation.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_02: And I had met you like years before, but like at no recollection,
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_02: I had not met you.
[00:02:35] SPEAKER_02: I'd heard about you a little bit.
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_02: So I go there with my capabilities presentation.
[00:02:39] SPEAKER_02: I sit down, the Democrats left, the booth.
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_02: And I sit down.
[00:02:43] SPEAKER_02: You basically were just looking straight ahead.
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_02: You were just like, I don't know what you were thinking about,
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_02: but it was not that.
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_00: Probably how we get the firm off of.
[00:02:52] SPEAKER_00: We raise some money.
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_00: And then Mark grabs the, like you grabbed the capabilities
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_02: presentation, which was generic, because I had no idea why I was there.
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_02: So and you go, like, OK, so how do you pick the clients?
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_02: And you're the clients?
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_02: And why those clients are not these clients?
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_02: And like teams, whatever, like detailed questions.
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_02: So I got this little grueling.
[00:03:10] SPEAKER_02: And then you both said, thank you.
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_02: And I left.
[00:03:13] And I concluded that it was proud because you were angel investing
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_02: at the time.
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_02: And you had just left HP.
[00:03:19] SPEAKER_02: I was like, maybe they just want to have somebody
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_02: they can recommend to their angel portfolio.
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_02: But I'm right.
[00:03:25] SPEAKER_02: And then a few months later, we met at the Rosewood.
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_02: I think, no, it was not the Rosewood.
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_02: We were there a lot.
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_01: So anyhow.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_01: And then you guys meant, OK, so we're going to start this firm.
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_02: And top secret blah, blah, blah.
[00:03:39] SPEAKER_02: I'm going to start this firm.
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_02: And it's going to be the two of us $300 million.
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_02: And this is at a certain time where money was kind of tight.
[00:03:46] SPEAKER_02: It's a number.
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_02: At the end of the world.
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:03:50] SPEAKER_01: There was no liquidity.
[00:03:51] SPEAKER_02: The last end of the world.
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_01: And I looked at a little critical.
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_02: And I said, it's not a great time.
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_02: And you said, Mark said, let's assume success shall we?
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_02: And then you had already had the idea of, well,
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_02: we wanted to say something.
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_02: But we couldn't be out talking to press
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_02: or be on Twitter at the time or whatever else and raise money.
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_02: We used to do a soliciting month.
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_02: So Mark then went.
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_02: He had a standing invitation, I think, on Charlie Rose.
[00:04:21] SPEAKER_02: And you went on Charlie Rose.
[00:04:22] SPEAKER_02: And you had a nice, very nice chat at the very end.
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_02: Just like, well, by the way, we're going to start to be see-for.
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_02: And then we all went quiet.
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_02: So that was that.
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_02: That's my recollection.
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_02: I don't know what you guys said.
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_02: I remember thinking, yeah, I was just so distracted
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_00: with how do we raise money?
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_00: Like we had never met LPs tell them.
[00:04:45] SPEAKER_00: And then we, every VC that we had been meeting with.
[00:04:49] SPEAKER_00: And we, at the same time, were meeting with lots and lots of VCs
[00:04:53] SPEAKER_00: trying to understand the industry.
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_00: And they all said, that's a dumbass idea for a fund.
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_00: You should definitely not do it.
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_00: They just wanted to give you jobs.
[00:05:05] SPEAKER_02: I'm assuming.
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, well, they were like, well, one of them said that we should just do,
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_00: like we'd never raise it from the LPs.
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_00: So we should just raise the money from VCs and give the VCs
[00:05:17] SPEAKER_00: who invested half the carry.
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_00: That was kind of.
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_00: Interesting.
[00:05:21] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:05:22] SPEAKER_00: That was one strategy.
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_00: And then the whole platform thing, that was really dumb
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_00: because it had been tried before and proven like proven like,
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_00: QED that it could never work.
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_00: Actually, who tried it for real?
[00:05:38] I don't know.
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_00: So I think the main thing that they were thinking about was the incubators.
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:43] SPEAKER_01: So I think it was the sort of the Belgrés.
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_01: It was the late 90s, exactly.
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_01: And you actually in retrospect, like, it's actually very, very,
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_01: like, so this is kind of the real big, gross idea lab.
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:05:53] SPEAKER_01: So this is Gibater created, I think a lot of companies.
[00:05:54] SPEAKER_01: I mean, among the companies you created turn out to be a company
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_01: that created basically the Google search model.
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_01: And so as well as like a bunch of other super interesting companies.
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_01: So I think those, those actually works,
[00:06:02] SPEAKER_01: the good ones work better than people remember.
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_01: But yeah, they specifically, and the incubators in those days
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_01: went for like a 50% equity split, right?
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_01: This contrast to the like Y-combinator, which is famously like 7%.
[00:06:15] SPEAKER_01: And so to justify the 50%, they provided office space
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_01: and you're telling services and your legal services.
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_01: And so, right, exactly.
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_01: And we had been entrepreneurs.
[00:06:27] SPEAKER_01: And so we just had a very different perspective
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_01: on what we actually needed from our entrepreneurs.
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_01: And so we just had a very different view
[00:06:32] SPEAKER_01: than the incubators had.
[00:06:33] And then the existing BCs just, yeah, for whatever reason,
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_01: couldn't put themselves in that.
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_01: And then I think because they hadn't been entrepreneurs.
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_01: They hadn't been customers of the VC product.
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_00: So they weren't looking at it through that lens.
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_00: They were looking at it from the provider.
[00:06:46] And by the way, those businesses were all great businesses.
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_00: So they sort of earned the right to be arrogant in that sense.
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:06:55] And I remember the Bill Gross, when he was talking,
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_02: and I met him, it was all like, OK, I have all these ideas.
[00:07:02] SPEAKER_02: Well, that was also that, right?
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_02: And there was that.
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_02: A higher-go-her, not a career.
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_02: You guys had come from a completely different lens.
[00:07:08] SPEAKER_02: And we had the ideas and believed that Larry Ellis.
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_02: And those people had the ideas, not the financial machinery.
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_02: And then obviously, you had absorbed Overt's playbook.
[00:07:19] SPEAKER_02: So it's a very different version of a platform
[00:07:22] SPEAKER_02: from an in-cubator.
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:07:25] SPEAKER_01: And as you know, basically, when we had to find a historical model
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_01: for what we were doing, it turned out to be a CAA.
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_01: Because that just mapped much more to what we had in mind.
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_01: Because they hadn't been a precedent
[00:07:35] SPEAKER_01: like that applied in the Valley.
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_00: And at that time, there was before Overt's book came out.
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_00: So that whole strategy was basically a secret.
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_00: Nobody knew it.
[00:07:45] SPEAKER_00: Like, you had to know Overt's to know it.
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_00: And Overt's was very secretive.
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_00: You know, we had several conversations
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_00: before we could actually get it out of him, even
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_00: who was out of CAA for many years.
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_00: You know, it was like a very secret formula
[00:08:03] SPEAKER_00: he had come up with.
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_00: And it was an amazing thing.
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_00: But it ended up being a genius thing to have him on your board.
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_02: Like, it was a very unorthodox pick,
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_02: like looking in from the outside.
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_02: And it led to all kinds of useful connections
[00:08:17] SPEAKER_02: and useful thinking, right?
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:08:21] SPEAKER_00: It was controversial at the time, even a much stronger
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_00: on board, I wasn't even named.
[00:08:24] SPEAKER_00: But it was different to have him.
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_00: We actually met him through Ron Conway, right?
[00:08:30] SPEAKER_00: Years ago.
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_00: The human router of all time.
[00:08:33] SPEAKER_00: The human router, yeah.
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_00: Great.
[00:08:35] SPEAKER_00: That was a great intro from Ron.
[00:08:37] SPEAKER_00: And yeah, what an interesting friendship that's been.
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_00: So the next thing that happened, so then we're going to raise
[00:08:45] SPEAKER_00: the money and we decide that we're going to talk to the press,
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_00: which was very different for VCs to actually be aggressive
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_00: about that.
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_00: Usually the VCs would want to talk to the press
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_02: and some of them had been clients at the IPO time.
[00:09:02] SPEAKER_02: So they wanted to basically have no risk.
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_02: But then when the company goes,
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_02: public is like, hey, I did that.
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_02: So we did it backwards, if you will.
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, right.
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_00: With nothing in hand, we just went for it.
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_00: So as soon as we raised the fund, was it, yeah,
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_00: we must have had to raise the fund to do the press tour
[00:09:22] SPEAKER_00: because they're kind of jumping out.
[00:09:23] SPEAKER_00: And so how did you think about it?
[00:09:27] SPEAKER_00: I guess it was very magical from our point of view
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_00: other than when Wired slammed the door on my face.
[00:09:34] SPEAKER_00: But.
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_00: Well, that was a huge signal.
[00:09:38] SPEAKER_00: We realized, oh, we have to, we have to even the plague
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_02: feel a little bit here a little bit.
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that was a little bit of a problem.
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_00: So tell us it.
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_00: Tell us about that.
[00:09:47] SPEAKER_00: So the way I used to think about this when
[00:09:50] SPEAKER_02: this was all working so magically is that, OK,
[00:09:52] SPEAKER_02: so if you read any article and you just dissect the headline,
[00:09:57] the paragraphs, like how it unfolds.
[00:10:00] SPEAKER_02: And then so you take a client like you guys or a product
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_02: company, you go, OK, how do I fill that?
[00:10:06] SPEAKER_02: How do I write that story from a reporter's point of view?
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_02: And like, you actually have it, right?
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_02: And so if the story is like $300 million and two people
[00:10:15] SPEAKER_02: have never actually done this before,
[00:10:17] SPEAKER_02: that's not a great story.
[00:10:19] SPEAKER_02: But we did have the column inches to fill, if you will,
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_02: because you had the idea for the platform, right?
[00:10:26] SPEAKER_02: You had been proven successful entrepreneurs.
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_02: You had credibility with the core audience, right?
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_02: And taking a step back, the thing that we all decided
[00:10:35] SPEAKER_02: is like, we're just going to aim all of our communications
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_02: at the entrepreneurs, at the entrepreneurs versus the LPs.
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_02: Because we have their numbers.
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_02: We're not a column.
[00:10:44] SPEAKER_02: And you guys got great introductions to people.
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_02: It all needs to be very entrepreneur friendly.
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_02: And so we sort of set out like we have this platform.
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_02: And it's all in service of the entrepreneur who
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_02: is the genius, if the, and then hopefully the idea works.
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_02: And then how can we add value?
[00:11:01] SPEAKER_02: And that was different enough to me, having met,
[00:11:04] SPEAKER_02: like most of all the other VCs.
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_02: And then, you know, the tall guy over here
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_02: had co-created the browser.
[00:11:11] SPEAKER_02: So that was not a VC credential.
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_02: But it was an incredible entrepreneur credential, right?
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_02: Like so, you know, and then you,
[00:11:22] that the turnaround, like the save of all time,
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_02: I mean, I have not so good with sports analogies,
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_02: but there's gotta be 17 in there, right?
[00:11:29] SPEAKER_02: Like having turned that around, and it's older to HP.
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_02: And like for like money, money, it was just spectacular.
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_02: So I think the two people who were behind it
[00:11:39] SPEAKER_02: who were very entrepreneur friendly,
[00:11:41] SPEAKER_02: they had really good credentials,
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_02: both on the tech side and a category creation side.
[00:11:46] SPEAKER_02: And on the sort of like how does one execute
[00:11:48] SPEAKER_02: one of those companies?
[00:11:50] And then you had the money.
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_02: And you had the money at a time when there was no money.
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:11:55] SPEAKER_02: There was nobody really raising,
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_02: and like the other people that could just sit and wake,
[00:11:59] SPEAKER_02: right, until times got better.
[00:12:00] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:12:01] SPEAKER_02: And then I think, if I remember correctly,
[00:12:04] SPEAKER_02: you had done it in three months,
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_02: which at the time seemed very spectacular
[00:12:08] SPEAKER_02: because there was no money.
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_02: So I could then pitch in, like, okay,
[00:12:11] SPEAKER_02: like it's those two guys and it did in three months
[00:12:14] SPEAKER_02: and have you read the news.
[00:12:15] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_02: And then they have all these ideas.
[00:12:17] SPEAKER_02: Well, actually one of the funny things
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_00: that happened while we were raising money,
[00:12:20] SPEAKER_00: that upset Mark, what upset me?
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_00: Because I just thought it was weird,
[00:12:24] SPEAKER_00: but we went to see an LP who we knew.
[00:12:29] SPEAKER_00: And the LP blocks into the meeting.
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_00: And here we are, like, you know,
[00:12:34] SPEAKER_00: and it really kind of brought us back
[00:12:36] SPEAKER_00: to raising money in general,
[00:12:37] SPEAKER_00: which is a good kind of thing to go through
[00:12:40] SPEAKER_00: if you're going to be investing in companies,
[00:12:43] SPEAKER_00: because you need to know what that feels like.
[00:12:45] SPEAKER_00: So, you know, we're practicing the pitch
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_00: where you got it all lined up.
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_00: We're like, okay, this is a big meeting.
[00:12:51] SPEAKER_00: It's a big LP.
[00:12:53] SPEAKER_00: And we go in and the guy comes in and he goes,
[00:12:56] oh yeah, you know, yeah, this, I, I, I, I, you know,
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_00: I hear what you guys are doing.
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_00: I think, you know, at best you could raise it in 18 months,
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_00: but it'll be very hard, but I got to go.
[00:13:07] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to go talk to some ex-entive-fell players.
[00:13:10] SPEAKER_00: Who?
[00:13:11] Right there.
[00:13:12] Go, go.
[00:13:13] SPEAKER_01: I have to go over to Stanford to talk to a roomful
[00:13:15] SPEAKER_01: of NFL players and how to manage their money.
[00:13:17] SPEAKER_01: And then they're, they're, they're,
[00:13:18] SPEAKER_01: they're NFL careers are over.
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_01: Like that was the, that was the thing
[00:13:21] SPEAKER_01: that was more important than talking to us,
[00:13:23] SPEAKER_01: which was a very, yeah, that was a level setting experience.
[00:13:26] Yeah, we were like, that was extremely motivated.
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:13:29] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_00: As you can tell.
[00:13:32] SPEAKER_00: It was.
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_00: Mark was like super pissed.
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_00: And I just remember going, wow, like that's so disrespectful.
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_00: It was just like so crazy that that he would do that.
[00:13:43] I just made a little angel investment
[00:13:45] SPEAKER_02: and like this entrepreneur is trying to raise money.
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_02: And like literally she's been told by an investor.
[00:13:52] SPEAKER_02: I think people like you just basically shouldn't exist.
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_02: Guess how motivated she is.
[00:13:58] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_02: Show that motherfucker.
[00:14:00] SPEAKER_02: This is the thing, the nuclear fire that you get
[00:14:02] SPEAKER_01: on the inside of that is, yes.
[00:14:03] SPEAKER_01: It's like a camp, people will actually say that out loud.
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[00:14:07] SPEAKER_02: And they're not like they're 95
[00:14:08] SPEAKER_02: and they don't have a filter anymore.
[00:14:09] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:10] SPEAKER_02: No, I mean, there was all these stories in this time,
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_01: but I mean, there were obviously many great VCs before us,
[00:14:14] SPEAKER_01: but they're, we, I mean, we went out and we basically met
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_01: all the, all the top VCs, you know,
[00:14:18] SPEAKER_01: kind of, because we were doing it.
[00:14:20] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, I'm a different guy,
[00:14:23] SPEAKER_01: one of the VCs at the time, I remember him saying,
[00:14:25] SPEAKER_01: oh, he's like, oh, yeah, venture is a great business.
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_01: Venture's like running, it's like going to a sushi boat restaurant.
[00:14:30] SPEAKER_01: It's like it's fantastic.
[00:14:32] SPEAKER_01: You just like, you just, it's sushi boat restaurant.
[00:14:34] SPEAKER_01: It's like it's fantastic.
[00:14:35] SPEAKER_01: You could just sit at the counter
[00:14:36] SPEAKER_01: and like the start of just like come drifting by.
[00:14:38] SPEAKER_01: And you're just like, oh, he's like every once in a while,
[00:14:42] SPEAKER_01: you know, whenever you want, you just reach out
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_01: and you just like pluck a piece of sushi.
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_01: Oh, she's like, I'm thinking, you know what?
[00:14:49] SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure that this is going to be as hard as we thought it was.
[00:14:52] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:14:53] SPEAKER_01: You mean competing parts?
[00:14:55] SPEAKER_02: competing parts.
[00:14:56] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's very informative in how we thought about competing.
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_00: We were like, and still to this day,
[00:15:03] SPEAKER_00: when we think about the culture of the firm,
[00:15:06] SPEAKER_00: it's like, don't be that.
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_00: Yes, yes, yes.
[00:15:08] SPEAKER_00: You know, don't, don't be Mr. Smartypants like sitting in your,
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_00: you sent him wrote office waiting for the sushi boat to come out.
[00:15:16] SPEAKER_00: Like, and yeah, I mean, look, yeah, maybe the competition isn't a hard,
[00:15:21] SPEAKER_02: but it felt like to me when I was at the out on the outcast side,
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_02: it felt like to me the top five firms never changed.
[00:15:29] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_02: Like never, ever changed, right?
[00:15:32] SPEAKER_02: And you guys didn't, you guys hadn't peeled off from a VC firm
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_02: and therefore you didn't have a try.
[00:15:37] SPEAKER_02: I mean, you had made some angel investments, but like, basically,
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_02: not so much, not to be insulting, but like,
[00:15:44] SPEAKER_02: we had no professional.
[00:15:45] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so,
[00:15:46] SPEAKER_01: the angel fund was like $2 million.
[00:15:48] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we had no tram, we had no training.
[00:15:50] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_01: And then, you know, the all, like,
[00:15:54] SPEAKER_02: there are exceptions, but all the important companies,
[00:15:57] SPEAKER_02: they're just like, the top five firms invest.
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_02: So like the conundrum was like, okay,
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_02: how do you break into that list without the substance, right?
[00:16:07] SPEAKER_02: Just with the ideas.
[00:16:08] SPEAKER_02: One more story, one more story from the,
[00:16:10] SPEAKER_01: you're gonna miss this one.
[00:16:11] SPEAKER_01: I love to tell the old piece.
[00:16:12] SPEAKER_01: Another guy said, oh, he's like,
[00:16:15] SPEAKER_01: help pieces like LPs.
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_01: You guys are gonna, you guys are gonna hate
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_01: you on LPs.
[00:16:19] SPEAKER_01: They're just the worst.
[00:16:21] SPEAKER_01: It's good to tell the competitor.
[00:16:22] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:16:23] SPEAKER_02: And he said, and he said the key is, he said,
[00:16:25] SPEAKER_01: I realized after a long career, I realized the key is,
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_01: you want to treat the LPs like mushrooms.
[00:16:28] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, like mushrooms.
[00:16:30] SPEAKER_01: Like mushrooms.
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_01: We were like, man, to the mushrooms.
[00:16:33] SPEAKER_00: What was that we, what are we talking about?
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_00: So the trick mushrooms is you put them in a cardboard box,
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_01: you put the lid of the cardboard box,
[00:16:39] SPEAKER_01: you put it under your bed for two years.
[00:16:41] SPEAKER_01: And then you don't take the box out
[00:16:42] SPEAKER_01: until the next time you have to raise money.
[00:16:43] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_01: Okay, so that's great.
[00:16:46] SPEAKER_01: And it was so funny because the whole time,
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_00: we're thinking, wow, you know, we're coming out
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_00: of running a public company.
[00:16:56] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:16:56] SPEAKER_00: We've got like, we're meeting with investors
[00:16:58] SPEAKER_00: who are shorting our stock.
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_00: And like, these guys have like,
[00:17:01] SPEAKER_00: very nice universities.
[00:17:02] SPEAKER_00: These are very nice universities.
[00:17:04] SPEAKER_00: 40-year-old time, right?
[00:17:04] SPEAKER_00: Which is like super pleasant to talk to
[00:17:06] SPEAKER_00: when we went out there.
[00:17:07] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:17:08] SPEAKER_00: And I think just think things to say is just so,
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_00: it's like, wow, you guys are living in like a weird,
[00:17:14] SPEAKER_00: perceptive world.
[00:17:15] SPEAKER_00: One of the surprising things to me,
[00:17:18] SPEAKER_02: I had not ever met LPs because I wasn't on that side
[00:17:21] SPEAKER_02: of the business.
[00:17:22] SPEAKER_02: But like, it's a really great community.
[00:17:25] SPEAKER_02: And a lot of them are super, super mission driven.
[00:17:27] SPEAKER_02: They're not financiers.
[00:17:29] SPEAKER_02: They're just the very cool people.
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_02: They're very long time horizons.
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:17:34] SPEAKER_01: And very patient.
[00:17:35] SPEAKER_01: Very devoted to their institutions.
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_01: Very smart.
[00:17:37] SPEAKER_01: It's been all their time thinking about, right,
[00:17:39] SPEAKER_01: all these topics.
[00:17:40] SPEAKER_01: They've been incredible, we have incredible discussions.
[00:17:42] SPEAKER_01: Great investors.
[00:17:43] SPEAKER_00: And very patient and you know,
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_00: want to understand the strategy,
[00:17:48] SPEAKER_00: care about the strategy,
[00:17:49] SPEAKER_00: plan to be in it a long time with us,
[00:17:51] SPEAKER_00: all that kind of thing.
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_00: It's, yeah, it was just very interesting.
[00:17:56] SPEAKER_00: But that was fun.
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_00: Like, it goes through the stories
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_00: because it is so indicative of so many of these things.
[00:18:00] SPEAKER_01: There are certain industries at certain times
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_01: where they just get wedged.
[00:18:03] SPEAKER_01: They get locked into patterns.
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_01: And the most uncomfortable thing in the world
[00:18:08] SPEAKER_01: is to break the pattern.
[00:18:10] SPEAKER_01: And if you don't have to,
[00:18:11] SPEAKER_01: you know, if you don't have to, you don't.
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_01: And if you think of it as a sushi situation,
[00:18:15] SPEAKER_02: or a mushroom situation,
[00:18:17] SPEAKER_02: why would you ever do marketing?
[00:18:19] Right, exactly, right.
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_01: Then the whole right thing.
[00:18:21] SPEAKER_02: Why would you ever?
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_01: Black box, cartel.
[00:18:23] SPEAKER_01: Some is steep, some like mystical,
[00:18:27] SPEAKER_02: very, whatever you'd like to do.
[00:18:29] SPEAKER_02: It's way better.
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_02: There's no pressure on it, right?
[00:18:32] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it was a very good strategy,
[00:18:34] SPEAKER_00: which is why we went out with the marketing
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_00: and then, of course, so we do the press tour.
[00:18:41] SPEAKER_00: And you get Mark on the cover of Fortune,
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_00: which was, that was amazing to me
[00:18:49] SPEAKER_00: because we had been running a company all these years.
[00:18:51] SPEAKER_00: And I remember you saying,
[00:18:53] SPEAKER_00: do you want to be on the cover of Fortune Forbes
[00:18:55] SPEAKER_00: or Business Week?
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_00: And I was like,
[00:18:57] SPEAKER_00: this is where you get a choice.
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, this is like, yeah, being on,
[00:19:00] SPEAKER_01: I don't know, I don't know,
[00:19:01] SPEAKER_01: Vatican Museum, it's just like the most important thing
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_01: you can possibly have.
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, those things.
[00:19:05] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, at the time.
[00:19:06] SPEAKER_01: In those days, those magazines,
[00:19:07] SPEAKER_00: particularly the covers were like,
[00:19:09] SPEAKER_00: incredibly important, tough to get.
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_00: And then, and then the thing that,
[00:19:13] SPEAKER_00: like really blew my mind was, I said, Fortune,
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_00: and then you got Mark on the cover of Fortune.
[00:19:19] SPEAKER_00: And, and,
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_00: For the first time in a lifetime,
[00:19:21] SPEAKER_00: nobody was gonna put me on the cover
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_00: or anything in those days, so.
[00:19:25] No, but you get to be on the cover of Fortune
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_02: when you did your book.
[00:19:28] Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I did, I did.
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_00: But that, we had to make famous first, yeah.
[00:19:33] SPEAKER_02: Look, the thing is, you never get what you don't ask for, right?
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_02: And then, it's, it's a, come, like at the time,
[00:19:41] SPEAKER_02: the publications matter really.
[00:19:43] SPEAKER_02: Now it's just the writer who matters.
[00:19:46] SPEAKER_02: And then also now they're downstream
[00:19:47] SPEAKER_02: from all the entire internet, right?
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_02: Like they come in at the end, basically.
[00:19:52] SPEAKER_02: But Kevin Manie was a really good writer.
[00:19:56] SPEAKER_02: He had had a really strong track record.
[00:19:59] SPEAKER_02: Like, you know, followed him forever.
[00:20:01] SPEAKER_02: And he would write substance of curiosity,
[00:20:03] SPEAKER_02: or different stories, right?
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_02: And he was great.
[00:20:06] SPEAKER_02: The worst part about that whole thing was that I'm photoshopped.
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_02: The smart kids stuff.
[00:20:10] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:20:11] And, and I got no memory when you,
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_02: when you did that thing or thing, I want you.
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_02: It's like, that's gonna be it.
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_02: Like, this is not even a question.
[00:20:18] SPEAKER_02: But that was the worst part about it.
[00:20:20] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_00: Now, it was good.
[00:20:22] SPEAKER_00: It was a scary picture.
[00:20:24] So it was good.
[00:20:24] It was, it was some fun.
[00:20:27] SPEAKER_00: But that, that kind of set off,
[00:20:30] SPEAKER_00: kind of really positioning us.
[00:20:34] SPEAKER_00: At that point, we knew we weren't gonna be friendly
[00:20:37] SPEAKER_00: with the industry.
[00:20:37] SPEAKER_00: So we were not only not gonna be in the cartel,
[00:20:41] SPEAKER_00: we were gonna be against the cartel
[00:20:43] SPEAKER_00: because they hated that cover story.
[00:20:45] SPEAKER_00: Oh my God.
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_00: I mean, they went bananas.
[00:20:49] SPEAKER_00: They called every LP.
[00:20:50] SPEAKER_00: They're like these guys, they're ego maniacs.
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_00: Look at him.
[00:20:54] SPEAKER_00: I'm gonna cover the magazine.
[00:20:55] SPEAKER_00: That's not supposed to be him.
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_00: That's supposed to be the entrepreneur.
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_00: What the hell?
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_00: I mean, they just like a westerner.
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_00: Well, I didn't have any of the rumors for the top.
[00:21:05] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, that's, no.
[00:21:07] No, that's, that's bananas.
[00:21:09] SPEAKER_02: I think that comes from them viewing having to do
[00:21:13] SPEAKER_02: any of those kinds of outbound activities
[00:21:15] SPEAKER_02: as beneath them and kind of unseemly.
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_02: And here we were like, like unashamed
[00:21:21] SPEAKER_02: about like advertising ourselves and our wares,
[00:21:24] SPEAKER_02: if you will, right?
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_02: So I was kind of like, what?
[00:21:26] SPEAKER_02: We're doing what now.
[00:21:27] SPEAKER_02: And it works, I think.
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_02: And I think it got sort of, I think that,
[00:21:33] but like mostly I think the writing got us in
[00:21:37] SPEAKER_02: with the entrepreneurs because like I remember,
[00:21:40] SPEAKER_02: I think it was you Mark told me that an entrepreneur said,
[00:21:42] SPEAKER_02: like, I kind of feel like I know you guys a little bit.
[00:21:44] SPEAKER_02: That's right.
[00:21:45] SPEAKER_02: Having not even met you yet.
[00:21:46] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so they hadn't been our offices.
[00:21:48] SPEAKER_01: They hadn't met anybody, but they had some idea
[00:21:51] SPEAKER_02: of that who are these people?
[00:21:53] SPEAKER_02: And what do they care about?
[00:21:54] SPEAKER_02: Nothing in there.
[00:21:54] SPEAKER_02: From then on, every time a GP would come on board,
[00:21:58] SPEAKER_02: we're like, okay, what do you want to invest in?
[00:22:01] SPEAKER_02: Therefore, we're going to write about these things.
[00:22:03] SPEAKER_02: Because that is becomes the magnet for the entrepreneurs
[00:22:07] SPEAKER_02: in that corner of the internet or AI infrastructure,
[00:22:10] SPEAKER_02: whatever it is.
[00:22:11] SPEAKER_02: And I think that was really powerful,
[00:22:13] SPEAKER_02: particularly with the entrepreneurs.
[00:22:15] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it was kind of one of, in those days,
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_00: the C was like a big secret.
[00:22:22] SPEAKER_00: And then actually building companies was a big secret.
[00:22:24] SPEAKER_00: And so just kind of talking about it was a big differentiator.
[00:22:28] SPEAKER_00: Which you would learn.
[00:22:30] SPEAKER_00: You would hear these horror stories from other entrepreneurs
[00:22:33] SPEAKER_01: of things that had gone wrong in the relationship
[00:22:35] SPEAKER_01: with the VC and all the problems.
[00:22:36] SPEAKER_01: But you didn't know, like, if you didn't know
[00:22:38] SPEAKER_01: how many people were when you walk in the door,
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_01: like, who do you trust?
[00:22:40] SPEAKER_01: How are they going to behave under pressure?
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_01: What are they going to do?
[00:22:44] SPEAKER_01: And so, I mean, yeah, it's a great,
[00:22:46] SPEAKER_01: so if you can get away with having nobody know who you are
[00:22:48] SPEAKER_01: and still be on top of the industry, it's great.
[00:22:51] SPEAKER_01: But like, if somebody actually does it the other way,
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_01: it causes a permanent change,
[00:22:56] SPEAKER_01: which I think what we can't last.
[00:22:58] SPEAKER_01: It does.
[00:22:59] SPEAKER_02: And to me, I don't know the latest numbers,
[00:23:01] SPEAKER_02: but like the blog posts that you would write
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_02: or the other GPs would write that are sort of like timeless.
[00:23:09] SPEAKER_02: Like, I remember the good product manager,
[00:23:11] SPEAKER_02: but I found that like, that is one of the most successful blog posts.
[00:23:14] SPEAKER_02: And you know how many blog posts the firmers put out?
[00:23:16] SPEAKER_02: Like, the good Gillian, right?
[00:23:18] SPEAKER_02: But like the ones that have depths that the entrepreneurs can,
[00:23:21] SPEAKER_02: like, take something from.
[00:23:22] SPEAKER_02: And that is somewhat timeless,
[00:23:24] SPEAKER_02: way more important than are we in a bubble?
[00:23:27] SPEAKER_02: Or are we not in a bubble?
[00:23:28] SPEAKER_02: That was kind of fun and that was like, like chatter.
[00:23:32] SPEAKER_02: But like the substance of pieces on like,
[00:23:34] SPEAKER_02: how do I construct a company?
[00:23:36] SPEAKER_02: How do I manage a person?
[00:23:38] SPEAKER_02: How do I think about promotions?
[00:23:39] SPEAKER_02: Like all that kind of stuff?
[00:23:41] SPEAKER_02: Like, I think that that was really valuable to the entrepreneurs.
[00:23:44] SPEAKER_02: And I think I also showed our all piece like,
[00:23:45] SPEAKER_02: okay, they actually are very passionate about
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_02: all the details of the stuff that they invest in.
[00:23:50] SPEAKER_02: Well, that was one of the interesting things
[00:23:51] SPEAKER_00: is the LPs were like reading all the content.
[00:23:54] SPEAKER_00: I mean, which is so different than public market investors,
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_00: I say, you know, they, and not only did they read the content,
[00:24:03] SPEAKER_00: but we have many LPs that Reddit would call up, say,
[00:24:08] SPEAKER_00: hey, in managing my little organization, you know,
[00:24:13] SPEAKER_00: this is what I'm running into and so forth.
[00:24:15] SPEAKER_00: So they really, they're real partners.
[00:24:17] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:24:18] SPEAKER_00: So it's a way that, yeah, it's just been,
[00:24:21] SPEAKER_00: that's been probably one of the best parts of the firm
[00:24:23] SPEAKER_00: is to get to have investors like that.
[00:24:27] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we got one, we did one incredibly controversial block
[00:24:30] SPEAKER_02: was turns out, like a few LPs really hated the headline.
[00:24:33] SPEAKER_02: And it was, it was in the bio and health team
[00:24:37] SPEAKER_02: and it said, fuck cancer, which I thought was a very controversial
[00:24:40] SPEAKER_02: that he obviously so nice.
[00:24:42] SPEAKER_02: They were like, did you have to put it that way?
[00:24:44] SPEAKER_02: I mean, they're very, they put this on like a rifle.
[00:24:48] SPEAKER_02: Screw cancer.
[00:24:50] Yes.
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_01: For the record, we're very anti-cancer.
[00:24:53] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we're very anti-cancer.
[00:24:55] SPEAKER_01: And we're willing to say so.
[00:24:56] SPEAKER_01: But they're deeply care about everything that we put out,
[00:24:59] SPEAKER_02: which I think is quite flour, even though they may hate some of it.
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_02: So one of the things in the early days that I wanted to ask you about
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_00: is like, because we came out and because they kind of,
[00:25:11] SPEAKER_00: we caused that reaction with the other VCs,
[00:25:15] SPEAKER_00: I kind of felt like we, you know, maybe I took it too far
[00:25:19] SPEAKER_00: in terms of just the VC competitiveness and the anti-VC stuff.
[00:25:25] SPEAKER_00: Like we really went hard in the early days.
[00:25:28] SPEAKER_00: So they were like, essentially brought this up.
[00:25:30] SPEAKER_00: Over the line.
[00:25:31] SPEAKER_01: So since you brought this up, you have to, you have to,
[00:25:33] SPEAKER_01: your thing with the, was it the serolacy?
[00:25:35] SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah.
[00:25:36] SPEAKER_01: The peak of this was the, your peak moment of this
[00:25:38] SPEAKER_01: was in the serolacy thing.
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_01: Okay, so it's a refresh, remember?
[00:25:41] SPEAKER_00: Okay, so remember serolacy, at her peak, by the way,
[00:25:44] SPEAKER_00: she was a great, great journalist.
[00:25:47] SPEAKER_00: And then she had this thing, Pando Daily,
[00:25:50] SPEAKER_00: that she started, and then she had this, these big events.
[00:25:54] SPEAKER_00: And I spoke at the event.
[00:25:56] SPEAKER_00: And she said, she said to me, and it's just like,
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_00: it popped out, she said, you know, you,
[00:26:03] SPEAKER_00: you kind of like have a lot of conflict with the other VCs.
[00:26:07] SPEAKER_00: And I said, well, I said, I come from enterprise software.
[00:26:13] SPEAKER_00: And so like when I see another VC coming at me,
[00:26:16] SPEAKER_00: and I quoted a little Wayne with the peacine,
[00:26:20] SPEAKER_00: all I see is a trigger and the middle finger.
[00:26:23] SPEAKER_00: And that's, so my answer was going to be that,
[00:26:28] SPEAKER_02: like, you have an inner enterprise sales dude in you.
[00:26:32] SPEAKER_02: And like, if there's ever, like, I think like,
[00:26:37] SPEAKER_02: when it comes to other firms, it's like, which is horseshit?
[00:26:40] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:26:41] SPEAKER_02: And then we can invest, like, we don't actually compete all that much.
[00:26:46] SPEAKER_02: But basically your filter is like,
[00:26:50] you're going to get the deal, or I'm going to get the deal.
[00:26:53] SPEAKER_02: You die or I die.
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_02: It's like, that's that's sort of the thing that happens to you
[00:26:58] SPEAKER_02: in any sort of competitive situation.
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_02: And you got help if you're on the way of that.
[00:27:03] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:27:05] SPEAKER_02: I think we over did it because like I said,
[00:27:07] SPEAKER_02: like you guys have joined Bortseys.
[00:27:09] SPEAKER_02: We will, our teams will call people is like,
[00:27:11] SPEAKER_02: hey, we've got this company.
[00:27:12] SPEAKER_02: Would you like to do follow-on of this?
[00:27:14] SPEAKER_02: And all that stuff here, you are to sign them off.
[00:27:16] SPEAKER_02: And we cause a lot of, I cause a lot of antagonism
[00:27:19] SPEAKER_00: between us and the other firms in that state,
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_00: which I think we, you know, at this point,
[00:27:23] SPEAKER_00: like we're more friendly.
[00:27:24] SPEAKER_00: Like at this point, I think.
[00:27:25] SPEAKER_00: More friendly.
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_01: And they're not exactly shrinking about what's them.
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_01: So, you know, they're also, also, also,
[00:27:30] SPEAKER_01: also true, also true.
[00:27:31] SPEAKER_02: They're originally the case.
[00:27:33] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:27:34] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:27:36] SPEAKER_02: I think we're past that maybe, maybe now.
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:27:40] SPEAKER_02: I think we're much more user-friendly now, for sure,
[00:27:43] SPEAKER_00: in terms of our VC partners that we have.
[00:27:48] SPEAKER_00: So, then tell us, you know,
[00:27:51] SPEAKER_00: one of the big pieces that came out was
[00:27:54] SPEAKER_00: when Mark wrote Software is Eating the World.
[00:27:57] SPEAKER_00: And how that came about was very interesting
[00:28:01] SPEAKER_00: because it was a really busy time for us.
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_00: It's like what, 2011, so it was very,
[00:28:04] SPEAKER_00: I think we had just raised a second fund, maybe.
[00:28:07] SPEAKER_00: And the way it came about was tire-ly random, if you will.
[00:28:10] SPEAKER_02: So, at the time there was a guy, you know,
[00:28:13] SPEAKER_02: the economist has these reporters
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_02: and they sent them to new regions and new beats,
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_02: like for 25 years and they go from Hong Kong to Silicon Valley, whatever.
[00:28:21] SPEAKER_02: At the time, there was a guy called Martin Giles.
[00:28:23] SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah, Martin Giles.
[00:28:24] SPEAKER_02: And he was covering.
[00:28:25] SPEAKER_02: Very nice guy.
[00:28:26] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:28:27] SPEAKER_00: Very nice guy.
[00:28:28] SPEAKER_02: Great guy.
[00:28:29] SPEAKER_02: And he would cover Silicon Valley,
[00:28:32] SPEAKER_02: he was a British, and every so often,
[00:28:35] SPEAKER_02: I forget what the cadence is.
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_02: They do a special report.
[00:28:37] SPEAKER_02: And they were doing a special report
[00:28:39] SPEAKER_02: on the state of tech and where it was going.
[00:28:41] SPEAKER_02: And we were sitting,
[00:28:43] SPEAKER_02: remember my first office was at this office?
[00:28:45] SPEAKER_02: I think it was next door.
[00:28:46] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's right.
[00:28:47] SPEAKER_02: It was like, we, the three of us were sitting here
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_02: and Martin was visiting,
[00:28:50] SPEAKER_02: and he's asking all these questions.
[00:28:51] SPEAKER_02: And Mark was like, well, it's basically,
[00:28:52] SPEAKER_02: like Software's Eating the World,
[00:28:53] SPEAKER_02: and then he explained something.
[00:28:55] SPEAKER_02: And I'm like, this is really interesting.
[00:28:58] SPEAKER_02: And then I was like, we should write this down.
[00:29:01] SPEAKER_02: And Mark's like, sure, maybe later,
[00:29:03] SPEAKER_02: and then I placed it with this guy, Ryan,
[00:29:05] SPEAKER_02: at the Walter Journal,
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_02: and he's like, if I had an op-out like that,
[00:29:08] SPEAKER_02: would you run it?
[00:29:09] SPEAKER_02: And he's like, yeah, sure, I would run it.
[00:29:11] SPEAKER_02: And then Mark wrote it when you could schedule things.
[00:29:15] SPEAKER_02: Like that.
[00:29:16] SPEAKER_02: And Mark wrote exactly one draft,
[00:29:18] SPEAKER_02: and it's still that same draft.
[00:29:19] SPEAKER_02: And I'm sure you're torturing yourself
[00:29:21] SPEAKER_02: because you would change all kinds of things,
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_02: this, not the other.
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_02: And then just for kicks,
[00:29:25] SPEAKER_02: to book end that story,
[00:29:28] SPEAKER_02: when you wrote, was it, it's time to build?
[00:29:30] SPEAKER_02: It's time to build.
[00:29:31] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:29:32] SPEAKER_02: Wrote it's time to build.
[00:29:33] SPEAKER_02: Like you caved for a minute,
[00:29:34] SPEAKER_02: and said like, all right,
[00:29:35] SPEAKER_02: a little place it.
[00:29:36] SPEAKER_02: Maybe we'll place it.
[00:29:37] SPEAKER_02: And nobody took it.
[00:29:39] SPEAKER_02: Nobody.
[00:29:40] SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:29:41] SPEAKER_02: I called Ryan,
[00:29:42] SPEAKER_02: who has since gone on to bigger and better things.
[00:29:44] SPEAKER_02: I'm like, Ryan,
[00:29:45] SPEAKER_02: ask your hypothetical, that thing,
[00:29:47] SPEAKER_02: like if I, like you've been at the Journal,
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_02: and you're like, of course, like,
[00:29:50] SPEAKER_02: it's just joke.
[00:29:51] SPEAKER_02: That's not even a question.
[00:29:53] SPEAKER_02: But times have changed.
[00:29:54] SPEAKER_02: So nobody ran it.
[00:29:55] SPEAKER_02: Wow.
[00:29:56] Good thing we had.
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_02: It's a big piece of it.
[00:29:58] SPEAKER_02: We had a good audience at the time.
[00:29:59] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:30:00] SPEAKER_02: No, and I, I think,
[00:30:01] SPEAKER_02: forget it.
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_02: Don't want to malign people,
[00:30:03] SPEAKER_02: but somebody said it's angry.
[00:30:04] SPEAKER_02: And I'm like,
[00:30:05] SPEAKER_02: you know, we're in a pandemic.
[00:30:06] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:07] SPEAKER_02: So this is where we are wearing conscious.
[00:30:08] SPEAKER_02: There's 20, 20.
[00:30:09] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:30:10] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:30:11] SPEAKER_01: The whole point of it was just that
[00:30:12] SPEAKER_01: what was actually happening in the pandemic
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_01: with literally the inability to get,
[00:30:14] SPEAKER_01: like surgical gowns.
[00:30:15] SPEAKER_01: And that for first responders was like the catalyst for it.
[00:30:19] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:30:20] SPEAKER_01: It's interesting.
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_02: It's ready to angry.
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_02: And I was like, yeah, yeah.
[00:30:23] SPEAKER_00: Suffer is eating the world is probably more famous,
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_00: but I'd say time to build is more influential in that.
[00:30:30] People read software is eating the world
[00:30:32] SPEAKER_00: and then they didn't do anything.
[00:30:33] SPEAKER_00: They were like, wow, that's very interesting.
[00:30:35] SPEAKER_00: And that was it.
[00:30:36] SPEAKER_00: But with time to build, like, the number of people in, like,
[00:30:40] SPEAKER_00: Washington and entrepreneurial community and so forth that are like,
[00:30:43] SPEAKER_00: yeah, we're taking this.
[00:30:45] SPEAKER_00: This is a blueprint.
[00:30:46] SPEAKER_00: We're moving on it.
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_00: I mean, in a way like the whole like abundant movement
[00:30:50] SPEAKER_00: on the Democratic Party came off of that.
[00:30:52] SPEAKER_00: Which is a great development.
[00:30:53] SPEAKER_00: It's a great development.
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_00: But I think that I have a theory on why that is.
[00:30:57] SPEAKER_02: Software is eating the world.
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_02: It's like to our people, our community, the,
[00:31:01] SPEAKER_02: hello, that's happening.
[00:31:02] SPEAKER_02: And they were all building against it.
[00:31:04] SPEAKER_02: They didn't need to read the thing.
[00:31:06] SPEAKER_02: And the people who needed to do something were going to get flattened
[00:31:09] SPEAKER_02: by the software eating the world movement.
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:31:12] SPEAKER_02: And they didn't know what to do.
[00:31:13] SPEAKER_02: Like, how do you retool into, like, remember all the car companies
[00:31:17] SPEAKER_02: that came to visit us, right?
[00:31:18] SPEAKER_02: And you've taken through autonomous and does the brand even matter?
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_02: And whatever.
[00:31:21] SPEAKER_02: It just did not register.
[00:31:23] They were going to become a software company.
[00:31:25] SPEAKER_02: Therefore, nobody, nobody who needed to do something that did.
[00:31:28] SPEAKER_02: It's just rather difficult.
[00:31:30] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:31:31] SPEAKER_02: So, you know, one of the very interesting things that we've learned
[00:31:36] SPEAKER_00: as a firm is how unusual it is for a company that's been around
[00:31:41] SPEAKER_00: a long time.
[00:31:42] SPEAKER_00: And where the founders are no longer there to change anything.
[00:31:47] SPEAKER_00: Anything.
[00:31:48] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:31:49] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:31:50] SPEAKER_00: And I mean, it's been a huge blessing for us in venture capital
[00:31:54] SPEAKER_00: and that many of the firms that were extremely powerful when we started
[00:31:59] SPEAKER_00: just never changed.
[00:32:01] SPEAKER_00: They're exactly as it were.
[00:32:03] SPEAKER_00: Like, it's almost like frozen in time.
[00:32:05] SPEAKER_00: It reminds me of, if you've ever been to Havana and Cuba.
[00:32:09] SPEAKER_00: It's frozen in time.
[00:32:11] SPEAKER_00: It's all 1959.
[00:32:12] SPEAKER_00: With cars in 1959.
[00:32:14] SPEAKER_00: It's amazing.
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:32:16] SPEAKER_00: It's like just frozen.
[00:32:17] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, whole industries freeze like the Vado industry for sure
[00:32:21] SPEAKER_00: to.
[00:32:22] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, it was a.
[00:32:25] SPEAKER_00: Did you see?
[00:32:26] SPEAKER_00: You know, Elon was came along for what?
[00:32:29] SPEAKER_00: How long?
[00:32:30] SPEAKER_00: Wendy started to us early 2000s and, you know, had been going and going and going.
[00:32:33] SPEAKER_00: And then like, when the car comes out and is awesome, everybody is just like sitting there going.
[00:32:39] SPEAKER_00: What do we do?
[00:32:40] SPEAKER_00: I mean, look, I just saw this on X.
[00:32:42] SPEAKER_02: I think like the lay off numbers up from the German car companies, my home country.
[00:32:46] SPEAKER_02: Like every six job in Germany is somehow related to the auto industry.
[00:32:52] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:32:53] SPEAKER_02: It's a disaster.
[00:32:54] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:32:55] SPEAKER_02: But they're not going like the.
[00:32:57] SPEAKER_02: A genius software engineers not going to you.
[00:33:00] SPEAKER_02: They're going to want to work for Elon Musk.
[00:33:02] SPEAKER_02: Like you can say about Elon Musk, whatever you want.
[00:33:04] SPEAKER_02: But like a.
[00:33:05] SPEAKER_02: Swav well manicured executive from the car industry is like not really like an.
[00:33:11] A talent magnet for software engineers.
[00:33:13] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_02: So, and then you know, one of the things that happened early was I got a note from Harper Collins saying that I shared a book.
[00:33:26] SPEAKER_00: And, and you know, way I did not have time to write a book.
[00:33:30] SPEAKER_00: But you may.
[00:33:31] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you thought, well, you thought it was a good idea to write the.
[00:33:34] SPEAKER_00: But why did you think it was a guy?
[00:33:35] SPEAKER_00: I guess it.
[00:33:36] SPEAKER_00: It seemed one.
[00:33:38] SPEAKER_00: It seemed crazy because the blog was doing so well.
[00:33:41] SPEAKER_00: So like, earn books pass a at least ask.
[00:33:44] SPEAKER_00: I mean, and then.
[00:33:47] Yeah, and then we didn't have to.
[00:33:48] SPEAKER_00: I didn't have time.
[00:33:49] SPEAKER_00: So like.
[00:33:51] Why did you think that made sense?
[00:33:53] SPEAKER_00: I guess it wasn't something that VCs did either.
[00:33:55] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:33:56] SPEAKER_00: Why I do.
[00:33:57] SPEAKER_00: I do think we needed to even out the brand a little bit because like otherwise any entrepreneur with leverage was going to go like, wow, I want him to be on my board.
[00:34:05] SPEAKER_02: And that was just going to get success.
[00:34:06] SPEAKER_02: We were so every other GP.
[00:34:08] SPEAKER_02: So that was like, we needed a plan for everybody, right?
[00:34:11] SPEAKER_02: And you were the other at the time.
[00:34:13] SPEAKER_02: The other.
[00:34:14] SPEAKER_02: I thought the book was good because I did.
[00:34:16] SPEAKER_02: And Dries another.
[00:34:17] SPEAKER_02: There is exactly.
[00:34:19] SPEAKER_02: Which is why you want to call it for which I'd recent.
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_02: I remember which.
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_02: It does sound hard to recent.
[00:34:25] SPEAKER_00: It's a cool sounding name.
[00:34:26] SPEAKER_00: It sounds a little law firmish though.
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_00: And then you could never a 16 Z would like learn what H 16 N is.
[00:34:33] SPEAKER_00: Not nearly as good.
[00:34:34] SPEAKER_00: No, it's.
[00:34:35] SPEAKER_00: It is good.
[00:34:36] SPEAKER_00: The way it is.
[00:34:37] SPEAKER_02: I do still think there is value in a book of like having a definitive theory on something.
[00:34:42] SPEAKER_02: I think with all the blockers and all the expos and all that, I think there is value.
[00:34:46] SPEAKER_02: People.
[00:34:47] SPEAKER_02: People read books.
[00:34:48] SPEAKER_02: People consume.
[00:34:49] SPEAKER_02: Consume books.
[00:34:50] SPEAKER_02: Long form podcasts.
[00:34:51] SPEAKER_02: Sort of a different version of the same flavor.
[00:34:53] SPEAKER_02: But more importantly, I thought you had something to say.
[00:34:56] SPEAKER_02: Like the actual theory of like how one builds a company and like all the stuff that goes sideways.
[00:35:04] SPEAKER_02: And as you always said, most books like whoever the guy was from this and that GE, whatever,
[00:35:10] SPEAKER_02: they were all kind of fancy resumes and victory labs.
[00:35:14] SPEAKER_02: They weren't really where you could learn something particularly for our audience.
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_02: That like it's so rough and tumble to be in a startup and to be in the trenches and to lose the deal
[00:35:24] SPEAKER_02: and like not be able to raise the money and you have this magical person mark out the door and all that kind of stuff.
[00:35:28] SPEAKER_02: So having an honest book that I think you I was expecting you to write.
[00:35:32] SPEAKER_02: I thought was really valuable.
[00:35:33] SPEAKER_02: And then you know the little hack that we had is you had written all the block posts.
[00:35:38] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:35:39] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_02: And so then it was a little built in on it.
[00:35:42] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:35:43] SPEAKER_02: And then it was it's telling the dramatic story of like what went down, you know, including with fleesha being sick and all of that.
[00:35:49] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:35:50] SPEAKER_02: And then that then made the book.
[00:35:52] But like you kind of had the lessons in your head.
[00:35:55] And like I actually think that book like I liked the title.
[00:35:59] SPEAKER_02: I've been living by what you do is who you are forever.
[00:36:02] SPEAKER_02: I like that title better.
[00:36:03] SPEAKER_02: But I think this is more important book and it's way more kind of usable for for people.
[00:36:08] SPEAKER_00: It's much more broad based.
[00:36:09] SPEAKER_00: I think the what you do is who you are is it's actually is more useful for me.
[00:36:15] SPEAKER_00: And you know when I talk to like Ted Sarandos or somebody like that, they're like, oh yeah, that's a book.
[00:36:20] SPEAKER_00: I like, but you have to run a very large organization.
[00:36:23] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_00: And you have to have gotten beyond the things that are hard thing about hard things to start to think about.
[00:36:30] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:36:31] SPEAKER_00: How do you program the culture of the whole organization and this kind of.
[00:36:35] SPEAKER_00: But I remember the Navy to abstract wanting to wanting to buy the book the hard thing about hard things.
[00:36:40] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:36:41] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:36:42] SPEAKER_02: And I think people actually think it's much more applicable than you might think.
[00:36:45] SPEAKER_02: Well, oh no, no, so it's very the hard thing about hard things.
[00:36:50] SPEAKER_00: I would say in retrospect was very broadly applicable like pastors bought it and you know, people you'd never think.
[00:36:58] SPEAKER_00: But you know, like to me, everything in the hard thing about hard things is like easy.
[00:37:03] SPEAKER_00: Whereas I had to think a lot more about what you do is who you are.
[00:37:07] SPEAKER_00: It's just like a, but you know, it's one of those things.
[00:37:10] SPEAKER_00: You know, how many people need to learn algebra versus quantum physics?
[00:37:16] SPEAKER_00: It's a thing like that.
[00:37:18] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:37:19] SPEAKER_02: That's a good point.
[00:37:20] SPEAKER_02: No, I actually thought the book was valuable to your brand and a good equalizer.
[00:37:25] SPEAKER_02: And also, I think it raised the ambition.
[00:37:28] SPEAKER_02: Like when we then hired new GPs, it was just understood that they were going to be out in the world.
[00:37:35] SPEAKER_02: And then it was a matter for me, for my team to go like, okay, so what are your thoughts?
[00:37:39] SPEAKER_02: Hopefully you have some, right?
[00:37:41] SPEAKER_02: And then what are you good at?
[00:37:42] SPEAKER_02: And then matching the format.
[00:37:44] SPEAKER_02: Not everybody should write a book, right?
[00:37:46] SPEAKER_02: And not everybody should do podcasts.
[00:37:48] Some people are good with decks and all of that.
[00:37:50] SPEAKER_02: But like it was a given that the bar is high.
[00:37:52] SPEAKER_02: Well, that's, you know, that's such a good point because one of the things that we always get asked because Grace did such a nice job of marketing the book is well, like how do you market your book?
[00:38:03] SPEAKER_00: And I'm like, well, look, you can do, there's like well-known marketing ideas and so forth.
[00:38:09] SPEAKER_00: And you can do a lot of things.
[00:38:10] SPEAKER_00: And you can get yourself even on like the best seller list.
[00:38:14] SPEAKER_00: But then the book's going to disappear unless it's a great book.
[00:38:18] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:38:19] SPEAKER_00: Like it has to be good.
[00:38:20] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:38:21] SPEAKER_00: Like that's the fundamental thing.
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_00: And so like if you don't write something that's good, if you're completely focused on like how you promote it before you've written it, like that's probably about that.
[00:38:30] SPEAKER_00: That's backwards.
[00:38:31] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_00: You have to actually believe that you have an idea that that's worth putting a book like a book has to stand the test of time.
[00:38:41] SPEAKER_02: You know, I mean, it has to be an actual thing versus a tweet.
[00:38:44] SPEAKER_02: Well, some of you people in business take a blog post idea, a blog post length idea and they try and turn it into a book and.
[00:38:53] Some things are just a snack.
[00:38:54] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, there's snacks and snacks should be snacks.
[00:38:56] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:38:57] SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
[00:38:58] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I know.
[00:38:59] SPEAKER_02: I thought the book served you well.
[00:39:01] SPEAKER_02: And I think it made it made everybody in the firm go like, oh, like I don't know that Andrew, would he have thought automatically walking in here?
[00:39:10] SPEAKER_02: It's like, well, maybe I should write a book.
[00:39:11] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_02: Like and it just made it open up the thinking I think for everybody else.
[00:39:16] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:39:17] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_00: And you know, a good thing about you also learn a lot when you write a book.
[00:39:21] SPEAKER_00: So I think everybody's it's at the standard of.
[00:39:26] You can't just have an idea here.
[00:39:28] SPEAKER_00: You have to be able to really think of through be able to articulate it, be able to write it, be able to publish it.
[00:39:34] SPEAKER_00: And otherwise like your idea didn't count.
[00:39:37] SPEAKER_00: And that that I think has helped us a lot as a.
[00:39:41] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, look at Catherine Boyle.
[00:39:43] SPEAKER_02: I mean, she came in with the pitch of like, if I work here, I'm going to do American dynamism and here's what that is.
[00:39:49] SPEAKER_02: And like, she also happens to be a gifted communicator.
[00:39:53] SPEAKER_02: And now it's, you know, it was a deck.
[00:39:56] SPEAKER_02: That's a movement and a fund.
[00:39:59] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:40:00] SPEAKER_02: And like, it's helping really change the way people think about the fence tech.
[00:40:03] SPEAKER_02: This ball was sent out.
[00:40:05] SPEAKER_02: Remember back in the day, Diane Green was out of it from Google for like a very innocent contract.
[00:40:10] SPEAKER_02: Look at pictures.
[00:40:11] SPEAKER_02: I mean, it's like, well, it's right.
[00:40:13] SPEAKER_02: And that like and Catherine played a replay is playing a really big role in turning that around.
[00:40:18] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:40:19] SPEAKER_02: And that's an idea.
[00:40:20] Yeah.
[00:40:21] SPEAKER_00: So, no, for sure.
[00:40:22] SPEAKER_00: I, it is a, you know, I hadn't actually thought about it that much, but it's a very important part.
[00:40:29] SPEAKER_00: It's like marketing, original marketing ideas turned into kind of a very important cultural point of the firm, which is, you know, like this is how we work.
[00:40:39] SPEAKER_00: This how we think.
[00:40:40] SPEAKER_00: I mean, sometimes it was so overdone, like a new person comes in.
[00:40:44] SPEAKER_02: The first thing they want to do is meet with marketing.
[00:40:47] Do you know where you're sitting?
[00:40:48] SPEAKER_02: And then, and then I was like, I literally have had people say like, you should really think about me.
[00:40:53] SPEAKER_02: Like, you should think about Mark and Jason.
[00:40:55] And I was like, keep what are your thoughts?
[00:40:57] SPEAKER_02: I know exactly who that was, but I'm not going to say no.
[00:41:00] SPEAKER_00: And it's all well intentioned, but like you do, you do have to test the actual idea, right?
[00:41:06] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:41:07] SPEAKER_02: Is that a snack?
[00:41:08] SPEAKER_02: Is that a book?
[00:41:09] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:41:10] SPEAKER_02: Is it just a conversation?
[00:41:11] Like, they need to be calibrated properly, right?
[00:41:14] SPEAKER_02: And sometimes young people who are incredibly ambitious, that was me, Stilas, like you just want to go right for the win.
[00:41:21] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:41:22] SPEAKER_02: But you need to make sure you have the goods to do it.
[00:41:24] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:41:25] SPEAKER_00: Well, this, this kind of gets into a conversation, Mark and I have been having, which is, you know, the marketing of companies has changed so much.
[00:41:33] SPEAKER_00: Because you're really now marketing a person.
[00:41:37] SPEAKER_00: And that's a lot what we did at the firm now, because the firm had our name.
[00:41:41] SPEAKER_00: It was a natural.
[00:41:42] SPEAKER_00: Also, we don't have products.
[00:41:44] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:41:45] SPEAKER_00: And we have products.
[00:41:46] SPEAKER_00: We have people and ideas.
[00:41:47] SPEAKER_02: That's it.
[00:41:48] SPEAKER_00: But that's extended now to, you know, is it, is it Tesla or is it Elon?
[00:41:54] SPEAKER_00: Is it Palantir or is it Alex?
[00:41:56] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:41:57] SPEAKER_00: And the, in order to be able to do that, like you can be an extremely accomplished person who is not interested.
[00:42:06] SPEAKER_00: Like those don't necessarily go together.
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_00: And I think that's a little bit unfair from the press or like it creates this perception that Silicon Valley is staffed entirely with weirdos.
[00:42:17] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:42:18] SPEAKER_02: They're more interesting to write about.
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:42:20] SPEAKER_02: Somebody who goes to work every day and drives an Audi and is a good father and drops kid off at school.
[00:42:26] SPEAKER_02: That's all nice.
[00:42:27] SPEAKER_02: Like I'll pick on someone, right?
[00:42:29] SPEAKER_02: Like Dylan Field.
[00:42:31] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:42:32] SPEAKER_02: Most amazing guy built an incredible company.
[00:42:34] SPEAKER_02: I hosted Dennis with him.
[00:42:36] SPEAKER_02: He's just normal.
[00:42:38] Well, just that the weirdest thing about him is that the Teal fellowship.
[00:42:42] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:42:43] SPEAKER_02: But like those don't get written up as much.
[00:42:45] SPEAKER_02: The weirdos, like the weirder, the better, right?
[00:42:48] SPEAKER_02: Like and it's gotten to an extreme where it's like this is actually not reflecting Silicon Valley.
[00:42:53] SPEAKER_02: It's just a slice of it.
[00:42:56] SPEAKER_02: Well, it's an interesting marketing conundrum though, because you can't market a company.
[00:43:03] SPEAKER_00: If you don't have a character, right?
[00:43:05] SPEAKER_00: Like like, no, you used to look, yeah, there used to be companies and it was fine.
[00:43:12] SPEAKER_02: What all you do is you report your financial results, you announce your new products.
[00:43:18] SPEAKER_02: And that kind of started to end with Steve Jobs because it was a show.
[00:43:22] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's right.
[00:43:23] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_02: And he made you want a product.
[00:43:25] SPEAKER_02: That's right.
[00:43:26] SPEAKER_02: Like it became, it's almost like politics adjacent.
[00:43:29] SPEAKER_02: Like you can't vote for a party of voting for a person.
[00:43:32] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:43:33] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:43:34] SPEAKER_02: And if you have the company, but not a character or a sense of character, it just doesn't work.
[00:43:39] SPEAKER_02: And then, you know, the corporate ex accounts and all of that, those are all fine.
[00:43:44] SPEAKER_02: But like at the end of the day, it's the identity of the person.
[00:43:47] SPEAKER_02: And do they actually sound like does the tree sound like Mark, right?
[00:43:51] SPEAKER_02: Like does the LinkedIn posts sound like DG or whatever it is?
[00:43:56] SPEAKER_02: Like you cannot disconnect it anymore.
[00:43:58] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:43:59] SPEAKER_02: And then, like, if you have a place, it's a premium on people who are willing to play character or be character.
[00:44:05] I'm not sure that's always the healthiest thing for a company at every, at every stage, right?
[00:44:11] SPEAKER_02: Or in every situation.
[00:44:13] SPEAKER_02: Like there are some downsides to it, but the upside beats the downside, like 10 to 1 or whatever the right number.
[00:44:20] SPEAKER_00: It requires a lot of discipline, I think, from the founder, because it turns you into like this mini celebrity.
[00:44:29] SPEAKER_00: And so as a mini celebrity, can you like be out there and not act like an actual celebrity?
[00:44:38] SPEAKER_00: Because those aren't great organizational dynamics just having been around, you know, many celebrities, although.
[00:44:46] SPEAKER_00: And the thing is.
[00:44:47] SPEAKER_00: I was notwithstanding he's a very regular person in that kind of thing.
[00:44:52] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he's surprising.
[00:44:53] SPEAKER_00: But he's very surprising. He's very unusual.
[00:44:55] SPEAKER_00: But he also has an amazing product.
[00:44:57] Yeah.
[00:44:58] SPEAKER_00: It's hard to argue with.
[00:44:59] SPEAKER_00: So like being able to be like this interesting character on the outside and then come in and, you know, me.
[00:45:06] SPEAKER_00: Well, just be somebody who you can have an actual conversation with where you can get information and not be this thing that you put yourself on a pedestal to the point where people are.
[00:45:16] SPEAKER_00: And that kind of stuff is very destructive in a company.
[00:45:19] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think there's some there's some downside along those lines.
[00:45:23] SPEAKER_02: And the other part is like, you can't really fake that stuff.
[00:45:27] SPEAKER_02: If you have a public persona and it's not real and it's all manicured, like does does not work.
[00:45:35] SPEAKER_02: It won't work over time.
[00:45:37] SPEAKER_02: Right. So you kind of have to lean.
[00:45:40] SPEAKER_02: And like this is what I was trying to do is lean into like, who is this person?
[00:45:45] SPEAKER_02: And what are they good at that they can sustain over time?
[00:45:48] SPEAKER_02: Like you make anybody do a TED talk if you really, really are hellbent on doing it.
[00:45:52] SPEAKER_02: But like that's not an actual marketing campaign.
[00:45:55] SPEAKER_02: That's not a personal brand.
[00:45:57] SPEAKER_02: You have to really figure out, okay, who is this person?
[00:46:00] SPEAKER_02: What are their dynamics?
[00:46:01] SPEAKER_02: What are their talents that they can actually be not act, but like actually be.
[00:46:06] SPEAKER_02: I think it's hard to actually be a character and a TED talk.
[00:46:09] SPEAKER_00: You know, with the people who do TED talks, aren't characters.
[00:46:12] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, a TED talk.
[00:46:14] SPEAKER_00: You've never done a TED talk.
[00:46:15] SPEAKER_00: I've never done a TED talk.
[00:46:17] SPEAKER_00: I think it's hard to do both.
[00:46:18] SPEAKER_00: I've never watched a TED talk.
[00:46:19] SPEAKER_01: You've never watched a TED talk.
[00:46:20] I've never watched a TED talk.
[00:46:21] SPEAKER_00: Oh man.
[00:46:22] SPEAKER_00: You heard me singing out on that very beautifully package.
[00:46:25] SPEAKER_00: It's almost like my point.
[00:46:26] SPEAKER_00: But that is my point.
[00:46:27] SPEAKER_00: My point is that is exactly my point.
[00:46:30] SPEAKER_02: TED talks are these very manicured things that like work for a minute.
[00:46:38] SPEAKER_02: But again, nobody who's seen so many TED talks is like, this is all the same.
[00:46:41] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's all the exact same plastic, right?
[00:46:44] SPEAKER_02: Or maybe you think it's platinum, but it's exact same formulaic thing.
[00:46:48] SPEAKER_02: That's not an actual brand.
[00:46:50] SPEAKER_02: That's maybe an event that if you really care about it, because some people really care about that shit.
[00:46:54] SPEAKER_02: But like that's not actually who you are.
[00:46:56] SPEAKER_02: They read to me as religious servants.
[00:46:59] SPEAKER_01: And I have an aversion to fake religions.
[00:47:01] SPEAKER_01: They're all more out there.
[00:47:02] SPEAKER_01: They're all more a little more.
[00:47:03] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, they're a little more at morality stories.
[00:47:04] SPEAKER_01: They've all got a message.
[00:47:06] SPEAKER_01: And it's like the very special episodes of TV shows in the 1970s.
[00:47:09] SPEAKER_01: They were the very special episodes where you like learn about.
[00:47:11] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, very special, happy day.
[00:47:12] SPEAKER_01: You learn about drug addiction or yeah.
[00:47:14] SPEAKER_01: And the thing is, I'm in marketing.
[00:47:17] SPEAKER_02: And I find them saccharine.
[00:47:19] SPEAKER_02: Like they're just too, they're just too perfect in a way, right?
[00:47:22] SPEAKER_02: And they train you like crazy.
[00:47:25] SPEAKER_02: And then, you know, they're the teams that peel off of Ted.
[00:47:27] SPEAKER_02: And then they help executives be great.
[00:47:30] SPEAKER_02: And you can just, I've talked to them.
[00:47:32] SPEAKER_02: And I'm like, like, you know, you've been invited to to podcast that are produced that way.
[00:47:38] SPEAKER_02: And they literally are trying to script what you're going to say.
[00:47:42] SPEAKER_02: And I'm like, we don't do that.
[00:47:43] SPEAKER_02: Back to the start.
[00:47:44] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:47:45] SPEAKER_02: And that's why that's why I'm saying that's why I'm rafting a little bit is because like my instincts are all to the exact opposite of that.
[00:47:50] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:47:51] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:47:52] SPEAKER_01: As you know, which is like authenticity and rawness.
[00:47:54] SPEAKER_01: When you could do a TED talk, I think you'd be fine at it.
[00:47:56] SPEAKER_01: But it's actually not you.
[00:47:57] SPEAKER_02: And like, therefore, it wouldn't accrue to the brand.
[00:48:00] SPEAKER_02: He could not do a TED talk because in order to do a TED talk, they have to review what you're going to say.
[00:48:05] SPEAKER_00: And they have to edit it.
[00:48:06] SPEAKER_00: And there's no chance.
[00:48:09] SPEAKER_00: Now what I'm saying is if he decided he wanted to do something.
[00:48:12] SPEAKER_02: Like if I had something Mark writes, like, I take one sentence and I give one word.
[00:48:17] SPEAKER_00: And then that's as much as he likes to be edited.
[00:48:20] SPEAKER_00: This is why I find it so hilarious when you send around like when you used to do that.
[00:48:23] SPEAKER_02: You send around the blog post and then everybody is so eager to edit them.
[00:48:26] SPEAKER_02: And I'm like, this is such a waste of time.
[00:48:28] SPEAKER_02: This is like, it's not you.
[00:48:31] SPEAKER_02: It's like not you.
[00:48:32] SPEAKER_02: So that's why you revised me my favorite thing that Larry David said.
[00:48:35] SPEAKER_00: The rule on Seinfeld was no hugs and no lessons.
[00:48:38] SPEAKER_00: No, it's not.
[00:48:39] SPEAKER_00: Exactly.
[00:48:40] SPEAKER_00: That's right.
[00:48:41] SPEAKER_00: It's a very special office.
[00:48:42] SPEAKER_00: That's what made that.
[00:48:43] SPEAKER_00: That's what made that show so distinctive.
[00:48:44] SPEAKER_01: They never did that.
[00:48:45] SPEAKER_01: They never.
[00:48:46] SPEAKER_01: It was never it was never modeling or sacra.
[00:48:48] SPEAKER_01: Never.
[00:48:49] SPEAKER_01: It was like almost making that way.
[00:48:50] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:48:51] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:48:52] SPEAKER_02: It's a very, very good show.
[00:48:53] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:48:54] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:48:55] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:48:56] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:48:57] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:48:58] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:48:59] SPEAKER_02: And look, that is great.
[00:49:00] SPEAKER_02: Like I'm not trying to align it.
[00:49:01] SPEAKER_02: It's like it's it's very manufactured.
[00:49:02] SPEAKER_02: And I don't think that's an actual brand as a person you can't be that brand.
[00:49:05] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:49:06] SPEAKER_01: The thing that works is well, and you know, a lot of this just has to do with the shifting technological environment.
[00:49:09] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:49:10] SPEAKER_01: But the thing that works in this media environment is much more much more authenticity and trust.
[00:49:14] SPEAKER_01: Do you think about it if you look at like a juiceman?
[00:49:16] SPEAKER_02: Well, authenticity and originality.
[00:49:17] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:49:18] SPEAKER_00: So the.
[00:49:19] SPEAKER_01: Interestingness.
[00:49:20] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:49:21] SPEAKER_00: Which is interesting because the old world like our media training in the old world was all like much is the opposite.
[00:49:25] SPEAKER_00: It was conformist.
[00:49:26] SPEAKER_00: Stan message.
[00:49:27] SPEAKER_00: Discipline discipline discipline discipline.
[00:49:29] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:49:30] SPEAKER_00: And not the window.
[00:49:31] SPEAKER_00: And the thing that I think what's interesting to media and that's what media has to figure out is.
[00:49:35] SPEAKER_02: They used to set the tone.
[00:49:37] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:49:38] SPEAKER_02: And now they're at the very end.
[00:49:39] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:49:40] SPEAKER_02: At the very end of all the stuff that's been said on Twitter or.
[00:49:43] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:49:44] SPEAKER_02: And then media is like, Oh, what is this thing?
[00:49:47] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:49:48] SPEAKER_02: But I'm not talking about the Rogan show.
[00:49:50] SPEAKER_02: But I get it's at the very end right.
[00:49:52] SPEAKER_02: And that's like for media, it must be total out of our body experience where it was like, wait.
[00:49:56] SPEAKER_02: Like I was the, I was the beginning right when you were when you were unveiling something.
[00:50:01] SPEAKER_02: That's where you would go.
[00:50:03] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:50:04] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:50:05] SPEAKER_02: And now you can go any freaking place that like you have 50,000 choices, right?
[00:50:09] SPEAKER_02: And then it gets enough steam and then it gets reviewed by media almost.
[00:50:13] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:50:14] SPEAKER_02: It's just that the order has flipped completely.
[00:50:16] SPEAKER_02: It makes it very tricky to speak to the media because when they're on that end and they have to turn you into news.
[00:50:27] Anything you say can and will be used against you.
[00:50:30] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:50:31] SPEAKER_00: You know, it's a very Miranda type world.
[00:50:33] SPEAKER_01: My new version of this, my new test, I think is happening is what we might call the GPT test, which is okay.
[00:50:38] SPEAKER_01: If what somebody says is indistinguishable from chat GPT output, like not going to make it.
[00:50:44] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:50:45] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:50:46] SPEAKER_01: And then the more advanced version of the test is like, is it indistinguishable from like chat GPT 3.5?
[00:50:51] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:50:52] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:50:53] SPEAKER_01: Which is like nothing, which is like the earlier version.
[00:50:56] SPEAKER_01: That sounds good.
[00:50:57] SPEAKER_01: And the number of public figures in various domains who continue to speak in public or put out crafted, you know, whatever.
[00:51:04] SPEAKER_01: And literally you're just like, this is indistinguishable from what the LM could do.
[00:51:09] SPEAKER_01: Or by the way, columnists, people are kind of calm for living.
[00:51:12] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:51:13] SPEAKER_01: Like there's a lot of people who don't pass that test.
[00:51:16] SPEAKER_01: And so I just say that there's going to be a big, big turnover there.
[00:51:20] SPEAKER_01: And then, and then it begs the important question like, okay, what does it take to pass that test?
[00:51:24] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:51:25] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:51:26] SPEAKER_01: Like how many?
[00:51:27] SPEAKER_01: While it's changing all the time.
[00:51:28] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, also true, right.
[00:51:29] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[00:51:30] SPEAKER_01: And then the version is actually, I discovered a version of the conversation with Tyler Cohen one time.
[00:51:34] SPEAKER_01: So Tyler Cohen is and his partner Alex have been blogging daily for over 20 years.
[00:51:37] SPEAKER_01: And the team is amazing.
[00:51:38] SPEAKER_01: And they do a great job.
[00:51:40] SPEAKER_01: And then their leaders have like these, you know, the influential movement.
[00:51:43] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:51:44] SPEAKER_01: Incredibly important.
[00:51:45] SPEAKER_01: And like all these things and they're in all these rooms that they, you know, they will say this like it's put them in all these incredibly important rooms.
[00:51:50] SPEAKER_01: And all these things and I was like, wow, it's worked so great for you guys.
[00:51:52] SPEAKER_01: It's like, why don't, you know, why don't more people do this?
[00:51:54] SPEAKER_01: And Tyler just like last.
[00:51:55] SPEAKER_01: And he's like, Mark, how many people have something to say every day?
[00:51:58] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:51:59] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:52:00] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:52:01] SPEAKER_01: Well, genuinely, like how many people have that?
[00:52:02] SPEAKER_01: And then, you know, every day for 20 years is like maybe the highest bar.
[00:52:05] SPEAKER_01: But how many people have, you know, three interesting things to say or one interesting thing to say.
[00:52:09] SPEAKER_01: But this is where this is my beef with some of these platforms.
[00:52:12] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:52:13] SPEAKER_02: Or actually, it's the humans.
[00:52:14] SPEAKER_02: It's not the platforms.
[00:52:15] SPEAKER_02: It's always the humans.
[00:52:16] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:52:17] SPEAKER_02: Or like does every thought that you have need to go on X or wherever it needs to go.
[00:52:23] SPEAKER_02: I would beg to differ.
[00:52:24] SPEAKER_02: But like a lot of people, now a lot of people were like, okay, it's a new day.
[00:52:28] SPEAKER_02: I got to say something.
[00:52:29] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:52:30] SPEAKER_02: And like, I don't know.
[00:52:31] SPEAKER_02: Well, to me, let me ask you this though.
[00:52:33] SPEAKER_01: Would you agree that the differences if they have an interesting thought every day, that's one thing.
[00:52:37] SPEAKER_01: Fantastic.
[00:52:38] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:52:39] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:52:40] SPEAKER_01: The more the mayor.
[00:52:41] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:52:42] SPEAKER_01: But yeah, most people don't.
[00:52:43] SPEAKER_02: But like most people don't.
[00:52:44] SPEAKER_02: And I sort of feel like they would be better.
[00:52:45] SPEAKER_02: They would be better.
[00:52:46] SPEAKER_02: They don't always.
[00:52:47] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:52:48] SPEAKER_00: They would better serve to like pop up when they have a thought or contribute something to the conversation.
[00:52:54] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:52:55] SPEAKER_02: That's.
[00:52:56] SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
[00:52:57] SPEAKER_02: I just don't think that everybody has interesting things to say every day.
[00:53:00] SPEAKER_02: Oh, I mean, I'm here.
[00:53:01] SPEAKER_02: Yes.
[00:53:02] SPEAKER_02: That's right.
[00:53:03] SPEAKER_02: Look at X.
[00:53:04] SPEAKER_02: I see proof.
[00:53:05] SPEAKER_02: Well, my theory at least is the nature of leadership is changing because of everything you
[00:53:08] SPEAKER_01: guys have discussed.
[00:53:09] SPEAKER_01: The nature of leadership is changing.
[00:53:10] SPEAKER_01: And the leader, the people, the leaders who have very large number of interesting things to say,
[00:53:15] SPEAKER_01: I know how to communicate it, are going to do disproportionately well in the years ahead.
[00:53:18] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:53:19] SPEAKER_01: And the leaders who don't, even if they're professionally skilled, I think are going to have a harder,
[00:53:22] SPEAKER_01: harder time.
[00:53:23] SPEAKER_01: And their companies are going to have a harder, harder time because it's just the old, the old
[00:53:25] SPEAKER_01: methods they're just not working as well anymore.
[00:53:26] SPEAKER_01: No.
[00:53:27] SPEAKER_00: Well, particularly on the, on the marketing front.
[00:53:30] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:53:31] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:53:32] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:53:33] SPEAKER_00: And, you know, like, but people are changing.
[00:53:34] SPEAKER_00: Like, it's been interesting to watch our friend Mark Zuckerberg kind of changes public personas
[00:53:42] SPEAKER_00: so much.
[00:53:43] SPEAKER_00: So great.
[00:53:44] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:53:45] SPEAKER_02: I mean, so he's kind of, I mean, running a gigantic social media company.
[00:53:50] SPEAKER_00: And he would, thank you, would figure it out.
[00:53:51] SPEAKER_00: But I guess, but it's still very difficult to do.
[00:53:53] SPEAKER_00: And it actually mapped to a journal change.
[00:53:55] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:53:56] SPEAKER_00: Like he himself changed.
[00:53:57] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:53:58] SPEAKER_01: It wasn't like a synthetically generated.
[00:53:59] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:54:00] SPEAKER_01: It's like it's every, everything of like Mark Zuckerberg and public now is, you know, a hundred
[00:54:04] SPEAKER_01: percent Holy Authentic.
[00:54:05] SPEAKER_01: He used to try to calculate what he was going to say through the lens of all his many, many
[00:54:13] SPEAKER_00: constituents.
[00:54:14] SPEAKER_00: And now he's saying what he thinks.
[00:54:15] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:54:16] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:54:17] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:54:18] SPEAKER_01: He received the A plus grade version of that training from people who were world class
[00:54:22] SPEAKER_01: at that.
[00:54:23] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:54:24] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:54:25] SPEAKER_01: And it worked for a while.
[00:54:26] SPEAKER_01: And then the environment changed.
[00:54:27] SPEAKER_02: But I also think he, whoever was like, like, overdidic.
[00:54:29] SPEAKER_02: I remember being in your office.
[00:54:30] SPEAKER_02: And it was like, that man has the wrong beer somewhere.
[00:54:33] SPEAKER_02: It's a scandal because it was so perfect.
[00:54:35] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:54:36] SPEAKER_02: So crafty.
[00:54:37] SPEAKER_02: And it was like chill out.
[00:54:38] SPEAKER_02: It was so tight.
[00:54:39] SPEAKER_02: Well, you know what it was.
[00:54:40] SPEAKER_02: And then he did, now that he's doing it, like, this is me deal with it.
[00:54:42] SPEAKER_02: It's working great.
[00:54:43] SPEAKER_02: And again, the people who trained, you know, people who trained in Marlach supergeniuses
[00:54:46] SPEAKER_01: and they were fantastic.
[00:54:47] SPEAKER_01: But they themselves were trained in what I would describe as like 1980s, 1990s style politics.
[00:54:51] SPEAKER_01: They came out of a political background, right, which is even more intense version of
[00:54:56] SPEAKER_01: everything that we're talking about.
[00:54:57] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:54:58] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:54:59] SPEAKER_01: So they got trained.
[00:55:00] SPEAKER_01: They got trained the way politicians got trained in the 1990s, which was extremely scripted and controlled,
[00:55:04] SPEAKER_01: like, maximally so.
[00:55:05] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:55:06] SPEAKER_01: And so, and then just the, as we've just, like, just this massive shift in the environment since then,
[00:55:11] SPEAKER_01: basically rendered, I mean, you see this playing out.
[00:55:13] SPEAKER_01: I think it's done a great job.
[00:55:15] SPEAKER_01: And so, you know, having a lot of things to do with the world, right, which is this is also,
[00:55:18] SPEAKER_01: everything we're talking about is also playing out politically, and maybe even more so politically.
[00:55:21] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:55:22] SPEAKER_00: And it's even, like, the subtle things have been the most interesting to me.
[00:55:25] SPEAKER_00: So he used to be known for, like, he's always growing a hoodie, which was the most conformist
[00:55:30] SPEAKER_00: thing in the world in Silicon Valley, right?
[00:55:32] SPEAKER_00: I know.
[00:55:33] SPEAKER_00: And now, like, he's got, like, the gold chains and this hair all over the, you know, and it's kind of,
[00:55:38] SPEAKER_00: like, he's expressing himself on all fronts.
[00:55:42] SPEAKER_00: But really, I was just saying what he looks like in private.
[00:55:44] SPEAKER_00: Like, it's now, now it all matches.
[00:55:46] SPEAKER_01: But I see it.
[00:55:47] SPEAKER_01: It's been great to kind of see him flower like that and be able to, like, fully express himself.
[00:55:50] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:55:51] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:55:52] SPEAKER_01: And still people are like, well, what's with the gold chains?
[00:55:55] SPEAKER_02: I'm like, he likes them.
[00:55:57] SPEAKER_01: Well, here's an executive.
[00:55:59] SPEAKER_01: The main one that he wears has a real, it's important with his faith.
[00:56:03] SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah.
[00:56:04] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:56:05] SPEAKER_01: There's a guy who runs a ginormous company that's in the spotlight all the time.
[00:56:09] SPEAKER_02: And like, this is what you're picking on.
[00:56:10] SPEAKER_02: I'm like, yes.
[00:56:11] SPEAKER_02: Hello.
[00:56:12] SPEAKER_02: I'm also true.
[00:56:13] SPEAKER_00: But it's, I think when people from the old world see that it makes them very uncomfortable.
[00:56:19] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[00:56:20] SPEAKER_00: One of, okay, one of the guys who was doing what we wanted him to is no longer, he's off the
[00:56:26] SPEAKER_00: lead.
[00:56:27] SPEAKER_01: No, the program.
[00:56:28] That's right.
[00:56:29] SPEAKER_01: Well, he's liberated.
[00:56:30] SPEAKER_02: We go all the way back to when, when, what's his name?
[00:56:32] SPEAKER_02: The found Dennis from For Square.
[00:56:34] He got yelled at because he went to a press meeting with a hoodie on, like, all the way
[00:56:39] SPEAKER_02: at the beginning.
[00:56:40] I remember that.
[00:56:42] SPEAKER_02: I remember that.
[00:56:43] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:56:44] SPEAKER_02: He was like, I think, and he had a banana or something like that.
[00:56:46] SPEAKER_02: It was like, apparently, entirely unacceptable.
[00:56:49] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:56:50] SPEAKER_02: It's almost makes it nostalgic.
[00:56:52] SPEAKER_02: Very interesting.
[00:56:53] SPEAKER_01: I mean, like, I think all this stuff, I'm obvious, all this stuff is going to intensify.
[00:56:56] SPEAKER_01: I think every successful company, I think every successful company, the future is going
[00:57:00] SPEAKER_01: to need this kind of personality.
[00:57:01] SPEAKER_01: They need somebody who can do this.
[00:57:03] SPEAKER_01: And it's a different leadership profile.
[00:57:05] SPEAKER_01: Do you think it has to be the CEO?
[00:57:06] SPEAKER_02: I think it's really hard for it not to be.
[00:57:09] SPEAKER_01: I mean, maybe, maybe it could be another founder, I think.
[00:57:12] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:57:13] SPEAKER_01: I wonder what it could do.
[00:57:14] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, co-founder.
[00:57:15] SPEAKER_00: For sure, if you're a consumer brand, I think it's very difficult to not have a person like
[00:57:21] SPEAKER_00: that.
[00:57:22] SPEAKER_00: I think, you know, if you're less marketing, like, if you are, like, if the, I mean,
[00:57:27] SPEAKER_00: there are historically businesses that are all sales.
[00:57:30] SPEAKER_00: I think, but I think if you're in a competitive situation, and on the other side, there's
[00:57:34] SPEAKER_02: somebody who's really good at it.
[00:57:35] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:57:36] SPEAKER_02: It's still sucks.
[00:57:37] SPEAKER_02: If you sell security stuff, it's not a price, you know, government as it gets.
[00:57:41] SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah.
[00:57:42] SPEAKER_01: No, it's killing it.
[00:57:43] SPEAKER_01: It's killing it.
[00:57:44] SPEAKER_01: He's perfect.
[00:57:45] SPEAKER_01: Imagine being a competitor to a palanter and not having an Alex, right?
[00:57:48] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:57:49] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:57:50] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:57:51] SPEAKER_01: Even just the stock market valuation alone, like, how can you possibly keep up?
[00:57:53] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:57:54] SPEAKER_01: It's basically, can you sell in the way you're selling today's entirely different?
[00:57:58] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:57:59] SPEAKER_02: Right?
[00:58:00] SPEAKER_02: Like, it's not, you know, having features and garden reports just like.
[00:58:03] SPEAKER_02: I think it's great.
[00:58:04] SPEAKER_01: I think it's, I think it's, I think it's leading to a more honest world.
[00:58:06] SPEAKER_01: Like, more transparent, more authentic, more honest, more interesting things we've discussed,
[00:58:11] SPEAKER_01: more interesting issues getting surfaced, people actually getting to know each other.
[00:58:13] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's a much less sanitized world.
