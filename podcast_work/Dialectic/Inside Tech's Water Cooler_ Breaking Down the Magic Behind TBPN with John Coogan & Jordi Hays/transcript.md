[00:00:00] I mean, the early thing was that we both had years and years of experience in the things
[00:00:04] John Coogan: that were important, which was YouTube, but on different sides, the actual content creation,
[00:00:09] John Coogan: you on the ad sales side.
[00:00:10] John Coogan: John's one of the few people, and certainly, like, at the top of the list of people where
[00:00:16] Jordi Hays: when I talk about the things that I'm good at, like, he's consistently bringing ideas
[00:00:21] Jordi Hays: that are better than my own, to come to John with an idea in a space that I'm good at
[00:00:27] Jordi Hays: generating ideas in.
[00:00:28] Jordi Hays: So let's say it's an advertiser that we're working for, and I'm like, I want to pitch
[00:00:32] Jordi Hays: them on this concept, and I come with an idea, and he's like, okay, what if you did it
[00:00:36] Jordi Hays: this way?
[00:00:37] Jordi Hays: Typically, when I pitch those ideas to people, they're just like, that sounds great, you
[00:00:41] Jordi Hays: know?
[00:00:42] Jordi Hays: And I'm not getting one up, and so when you have a partnership, it's like, you want to be
[00:00:45] Jordi Hays: getting one up.
[00:00:46] Jordi Hays: Like, all the time.
[00:00:47] Jordi Hays: The other thing that's real is like, we never run out of things to talk about.
[00:00:50] Jordi Hays: If it's like a Friday and John is like driving to Santa Barbara, I'm going to Malibu,
[00:00:55] Jordi Hays: and like, instead of taking my drive, I'll just send the driver home like separately, and
[00:00:59] Jordi Hays: I'll be like, I'm riding with John.
[00:01:00] Jordi Hays: John, we got to come more.
[00:01:02] Jordi Hays: John goes out of the way, because we're like, yeah, like, I didn't get quite enough time.
[00:01:06] John Coogan: We've been growing this newsletter.
[00:01:08] John Coogan: Every day I write a couple hundred more.
[00:01:10] John Coogan: Yeah, right.
[00:01:11] John Coogan: It's just to kind of summarize my thoughts on like the current thing or whatever is in my
[00:01:14] John Coogan: mind.
[00:01:15] John Coogan: And I realize like, we post it on X as well, and we're kind of writing for that audience,
[00:01:19] John Coogan: and I have a vague idea of who's on the newsletter subscription, but I'm not super
[00:01:24] John Coogan: in there.
[00:01:25] John Coogan: And I was thinking like, really, like, I'm writing this for Jordy.
[00:01:27] John Coogan: Like I'm pitching an idea to Jordy.
[00:01:30] John Coogan: It's like, there's a little bit of like, Jordy capture in the sense of like, I'm trying
[00:01:34] John Coogan: to find something.
[00:01:35] John Coogan: I'm not trying to find something that I'm like, you have to actually try to make something
[00:01:37] John Coogan: that will make you like, tee off.
[00:01:39] John Coogan: Yeah.
[00:01:40] John Coogan: I don't want to bore you.
[00:01:41] John Coogan: You have like a pretty clear vision into what like the show looks like in 30 years.
[00:01:45] John Coogan: And it's not vice news where you have a bunch of other people doing other shows.
[00:01:50] John Coogan: Like we're not building a media company, a platform with a bunch of other things where
[00:01:53] John Coogan: it's like, oh yeah, thank goodness.
[00:01:55] John Coogan: We don't have to podcast today, but we hired hosts.
[00:01:58] John Coogan: It's like, no, we're building a show.
[00:01:59] John Coogan: You can look at what Rogan's organization looks like and Heberman's organization looks
[00:02:03] John Coogan: like.
[00:02:04] John Coogan: And you can see that you can be doing a hundred million dollars a year top line with a
[00:02:08] John Coogan: team of 10.
[00:02:09] John Coogan: So why not just do that?
[00:02:11] John Coogan: That means you have to show up every day.
[00:02:13] Jordi Hays: But it's also an opportunity to iterate every day.
[00:02:15] Jordi Hays: A baker gets to show up every day.
[00:02:16] Jordi Hays: They make bread.
[00:02:17] Jordi Hays: But every single day they can change tiny little things.
[00:02:20] Jordi Hays: They can change the temperature.
[00:02:21] Jordi Hays: What if you change the temperature?
[00:02:22] Jordi Hays: What if you change the amount of yeast?
[00:02:23] Jordi Hays: What if you change the amount of flour?
[00:02:24] Jordi Hays: When we think about making the show every single day, we know when the product is great,
[00:02:29] Jordi Hays: we feel it.
[00:02:30] Jordi Hays: We end the show every day and we're talking through, okay, this section could have been
[00:02:33] Jordi Hays: better.
[00:02:34] Jordi Hays: That story.
[00:02:35] Jordi Hays: That interview was really slow.
[00:02:36] Jordi Hays: We got to like adjust the schedule for tomorrow to make sure that doesn't happen again.
[00:02:39] Jordi Hays: And so every single day is an opportunity to make the product better.
[00:02:43] Jordi Hays: Every single day is new and trying to really compound it.
[00:02:46] Jordi Hays: And I think we've done a good job of that.
[00:02:47] Jordi Hays: If you look at just one shot of the show every single day over the last year, you would
[00:02:51] Jordi Hays: see very clearly there's like minor iterations happening every single day.
[00:02:56] Jordi Hays: And every single day we've learned something new about the show and how to make it better.
[00:02:59] Jordi Hays: And I think we'll do that for a very, very, very long time.
[00:03:02] Jordi Hays: If you enjoy making things, there's nothing better than content to me.
[00:03:06] Jordi Hays: Because we can have an idea at breakfast and ship it like two hours later so that iteration
[00:03:11] Jordi Hays: is just like super addictive.
[00:03:13] Jordi Hays: I'm laughing because we're talking about how addictive media is.
[00:03:15] John Coogan: And I think we're on the 5th hour podcast.
[00:03:18] John Coogan: Welcome to Dialectic Episode 33 with John Cougan and Jordy Hayes, aka TBPN.
[00:03:25] For those of you who are not as terminally online as I am, they have taken the TechWorld
[00:03:31] Jackson Dahl: in the world of Twitter in particular, X in particular, by storm over the last year.
[00:03:35] Jackson Dahl: They only launched about a year ago.
[00:03:38] Jackson Dahl: And their daily live show didn't start that way.
[00:03:40] Jackson Dahl: But when it's become a daily live show has absolutely become kind of a center of gravity
[00:03:46] Jackson Dahl: for the TechWorld.
[00:03:47] Jackson Dahl: I've known Jordy for a while and met John more recently, but getting to watch what they
[00:03:51] Jackson Dahl: put together and not only how interesting and substantive and compelling, but particularly
[00:03:58] Jackson Dahl: how fun TBPN is getting to watch that has been really awesome.
[00:04:02] Jackson Dahl: And it's so surprised they have so many fans.
[00:04:05] I was able to crash the Ultra Dome, which is their studio in Los Angeles and have a conversation
[00:04:11] Jackson Dahl: with them about among many other things, podcasting, building a media business, tech culture,
[00:04:16] Jackson Dahl: building a brand, something I'm particularly interested in, which is the notion that the
[00:04:21] Jackson Dahl: tech industry is particularly weak at references and borrowing from historical ideas, other industries,
[00:04:29] Jackson Dahl: etc.
[00:04:30] Jackson Dahl: You can look at the media world and the fashion world and see all of the ways they do that.
[00:04:34] Jackson Dahl: And one of the things John and Jordy talk about is how many ideas they've taken from other
[00:04:39] Jackson Dahl: industries.
[00:04:40] Jackson Dahl: And that's part of what has made TBPN feel so fresh.
[00:04:43] Jackson Dahl: And so, you know, John and Jordy are both serial entrepreneurs.
[00:04:46] Jackson Dahl: John was an EIR Founders Fund and made technology oriented YouTube videos as well as founding
[00:04:51] Jackson Dahl: Lucy Nicotine and Soilent, if you remember that.
[00:04:54] Jackson Dahl: And Jordy has founded a number of companies and invested many more, including Party Round
[00:04:59] Jackson Dahl: aka Capital, most recently branded native, which is a YouTube and podcasting network he
[00:05:04] Jackson Dahl: built early on in his career as well as several others.
[00:05:07] Jackson Dahl: It was really cool to see just why their collaboration makes so much sense and what they bring
[00:05:12] Jackson Dahl: to the table at both overlaps and contrasts.
[00:05:15] Jackson Dahl: You'll hear that in the very first question when I ask them about technology versus business.
[00:05:20] Jackson Dahl: This was so fun.
[00:05:21] Jackson Dahl: I think you'll see the amount of thoughtfulness and process and consideration that goes into
[00:05:27] Jackson Dahl: a show that at sometimes can feel really light and fun and easy was inspiring for me.
[00:05:32] Jackson Dahl: In many ways, dialectic and TBPN are on very opposite ends of the spectrum and it was
[00:05:37] Jackson Dahl: cool to meet in the middle.
[00:05:39] Jackson Dahl: And I learned a lot.
[00:05:40] Jackson Dahl: I hope regardless whether you're interested in the media side of things or not, I think
[00:05:44] Jackson Dahl: there's so much to learn from John and Jordy today about technology and culture and business
[00:05:50] Jackson Dahl: and attention and how to build something that actually feels differentiated and fresh
[00:05:55] Jackson Dahl: and unique in a world where there is so much competition and there are so many people
[00:06:00] Jackson Dahl: trying to do very similar things.
[00:06:02] Jackson Dahl: But that here is John Cougan and Jordy Hayes, TBPN.
[00:06:09] Jackson Dahl: All right.
[00:06:10] Jackson Dahl: John Cougan, Jordy Hayes, we're here.
[00:06:13] Jackson Dahl: Thank you for having me.
[00:06:14] Jackson Dahl: Thank you for having us.
[00:06:16] Jackson Dahl: How many of the ultra-dom?
[00:06:17] Jackson Dahl: Physically and spiritually.
[00:06:19] Jackson Dahl: We're going to start really serious.
[00:06:21] Jackson Dahl: OK.
[00:06:22] Jackson Dahl: This is, you've spent the last year building a show about technology and business.
[00:06:27] Jackson Dahl: And so I need to know what do you love more, technology or business?
[00:06:32] Jackson Dahl: I think John loves technology more.
[00:06:36] Jordi Hays: I love business more.
[00:06:37] Jordi Hays: That's fair.
[00:06:38] Jordi Hays: And that's why we're a good duo.
[00:06:41] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[00:06:42] Jordi Hays: Easy, beautiful.
[00:06:43] Jordi Hays: OK.
[00:06:43] Jordi Hays: Like, John really gets, I would say, like deeper, super nerdy.
[00:06:49] Jordi Hays: Super nerdy.
[00:06:49] Jordi Hays: Nords out.
[00:06:50] Jordi Hays: Technical stuff.
[00:06:51] John Coogan: Much more from a technical standpoint.
[00:06:53] Jordi Hays: Meanwhile, like, I've, John started multiple companies.
[00:06:56] Jordi Hays: I've done a lot more like deals, right?
[00:06:59] Jordi Hays: So investing, helping put companies together.
[00:07:03] Jordi Hays: And so that's kind of what I'm bringing to the table.
[00:07:06] Jordi Hays: And then it's super important when we're doing an interview with somebody.
[00:07:11] Jordi Hays: John hits them with a question that they're not expecting from, like,
[00:07:15] Jordi Hays: two non-technical podcasters.
[00:07:18] Jordi Hays: And it just opens up an interview so much more.
[00:07:19] Jordi Hays: I think it's really powerful.
[00:07:21] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[00:07:22] Jackson Dahl: Was that clear coming in?
[00:07:23] Jackson Dahl: Or when you first started talking about this?
[00:07:25] Jackson Dahl: Was that something that kind of was part of the calculus at all?
[00:07:27] Jackson Dahl: No.
[00:07:28] John Coogan: Not at all.
[00:07:29] No.
[00:07:29] I.
[00:07:31] The story of TBPN is two guys decide they should do a podcast.
[00:07:36] Jordi Hays: And it's not much deeper than that.
[00:07:41] Jordi Hays: Like, we had talked about doing something together.
[00:07:45] Jordi Hays: We had talked about what the right format would be.
[00:07:49] Jordi Hays: And John had figured out the format.
[00:07:51] Jordi Hays: And I, at one point, texted him.
[00:07:54] Jordi Hays: We should be really hard to find the original text.
[00:07:56] Jordi Hays: But I was like, the name of the podcast is Technology Brothers.
[00:08:00] Jordi Hays: And then we just sent it up recording the first episode within a couple weeks from that.
[00:08:03] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[00:08:04] John Coogan: And you look at the first or second episodes.
[00:08:07] John Coogan: It was actually a crazy full circle moment.
[00:08:09] John Coogan: Because in the second episode, we reviewed two products.
[00:08:12] John Coogan: One was an energy drink from our friend, John Fio.
[00:08:14] John Coogan: Oh, yeah.
[00:08:15] John Coogan: And the second product was the Meta Ray Bans from Meta.
[00:08:19] John Coogan: Of course.
[00:08:20] John Coogan: And then within a year, we were interviewing Mark Zuckerberg and the entire Meta team about
[00:08:24] John Coogan: the latest Ray Bans, which at Meta Campus, at the Sports Center desk, very different from
[00:08:29] John Coogan: the second episode, which is recorded in this tiny conference room, just to, you know,
[00:08:34] John Coogan: to people.
[00:08:35] John Coogan: I don't even think there were any team members there.
[00:08:37] John Coogan: There was no, like, no one was watching it.
[00:08:39] John Coogan: It was literally, um, that David Center.
[00:08:41] John Coogan: I think, no, no, but I think Ben was sick that day.
[00:08:44] John Coogan: And so I had to push the button to hit record.
[00:08:46] John Coogan: We, so it was just me and you in the studio that day.
[00:08:48] John Coogan: That was it.
[00:08:49] John Coogan: Yeah.
[00:08:50] John Coogan: But if you go and you look through, like, the nature of our discussion about the Meta
[00:08:55] John Coogan: Ray Bans from a technical perspective, it's not like we are tearing it apart and looking
[00:09:00] John Coogan: at the SPACs.
[00:09:01] John Coogan: And from a business perspective, it's not like you were pulling up like the financials
[00:09:04] John Coogan: of the company and trying to, like, do some deep dive there.
[00:09:06] John Coogan: It was more of, like, just a fluid conversation about some of the lineage of the tech, some
[00:09:11] John Coogan: of the technology decisions that were made, and then also some of the, you know, branding,
[00:09:16] John Coogan: marketing, business decisions on who they partnered with.
[00:09:19] John Coogan: You made a very strong case for the Laxotic partnership being bullish.
[00:09:23] John Coogan: And we kind of just went back and forth on personal experiences, our thoughts on the
[00:09:29] John Coogan: technology, how this fits in with Apple and other companies.
[00:09:31] John Coogan: We just kind of noodle that in for like 35 minutes or something.
[00:09:33] John Coogan: It was a lot of fun.
[00:09:34] John Coogan: It's also funny to go back.
[00:09:36] Jackson Dahl: The pacing is a little different.
[00:09:37] Jackson Dahl: Oh, yeah.
[00:09:38] Jackson Dahl: Oh, yeah.
[00:09:39] Jackson Dahl: Was it more rapid fire?
[00:09:40] Jordi Hays: I don't even remember.
[00:09:41] Jordi Hays: No, no, no, you're just, it was literally like you guys are just hanging out.
[00:09:45] Jordi Hays: Like, oh, yeah, I guess.
[00:09:48] Jackson Dahl: Oh, John has this energy.
[00:09:51] Jackson Dahl: Also, did John, John didn't actually climb all those mountains, right?
[00:09:54] Jackson Dahl: That's no, no, no, no, no.
[00:09:55] Jackson Dahl: That's like, I've known him for a long time.
[00:09:57] Jackson Dahl: That is not.
[00:09:58] John Coogan: Do you mean the 14?
[00:09:59] Jordi Hays: Yeah, I mean, I think early on, early on, we had a lot of bits.
[00:10:01] Jordi Hays: That were just really extreme.
[00:10:03] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[00:10:04] Jordi Hays: And that was what part of what I think made it magic.
[00:10:07] Jordi Hays: And we had a handful of people that were like our very close friends that was listened
[00:10:11] Jordi Hays: to it.
[00:10:12] Jordi Hays: And so we was really just making it for like a group chat, basically.
[00:10:15] Jordi Hays: And then over time, we realized like, okay, we got to dial some of these bits back.
[00:10:20] Jordi Hays: I, we're both very sarcastic.
[00:10:22] Jordi Hays: And I think a lot of people appreciate that.
[00:10:25] Jordi Hays: But there's certainly probably thousands of people out there that like didn't understand
[00:10:28] Jordi Hays: sarcasm in a specific moment.
[00:10:30] Jordi Hays: So we have a really good story.
[00:10:32] Jordi Hays: So we were, Figma launched like the most like normal, somewhat modest product update.
[00:10:40] Jordi Hays: I don't even remember.
[00:10:41] Jordi Hays: It was the ability to dynamically resize models or like certain UI elements.
[00:10:48] John Coogan: You could, you know, say, I want this to be 30% of the screen or something like that.
[00:10:52] John Coogan: It would like dynamically resize the things.
[00:10:53] John Coogan: It was a feature that people had wanted for a long time.
[00:10:56] Jordi Hays: The heads.
[00:10:57] Jordi Hays: And they finally, they finally, they finally shipped it.
[00:11:00] Jordi Hays: And we made, we were riffing on, you know, how, how there have been protests in the streets
[00:11:05] Jordi Hays: of Brooklyn for weeks, demanding a Dylan Field and the team release this update.
[00:11:10] Jordi Hays: And we got somebody crashed out harder than I think.
[00:11:13] Jordi Hays: I've ever experienced, I've ever experienced.
[00:11:16] Jordi Hays: It was like this person made this over, we published it.
[00:11:19] Jordi Hays: And within like by that evening, in this person again, we had, we had, like, nobody was
[00:11:24] Jordi Hays: really very little attention on, on the show or anything like that.
[00:11:28] Jordi Hays: And it was hundreds of posts and comments from one person.
[00:11:33] Jordi Hays: I was still working at Founders Fund as an entrepreneur residence.
[00:11:37] John Coogan: The guy was messaging Peter Teal saying, you have to fire this guy because he was just
[00:11:42] John Coogan: not true.
[00:11:43] John Coogan: It's just not true.
[00:11:44] John Coogan: He was like, I like, he was like, I live in Brooklyn.
[00:11:48] Jordi Hays: This never happened.
[00:11:49] Jordi Hays: He thought it was like fake news instead of just obviously a joke.
[00:11:52] John Coogan: Obviously, people are protesting for better big mental tools.
[00:11:55] John Coogan: We love big things.
[00:11:56] John Coogan: Maybe that's how you knew you were onto something.
[00:11:57] Jackson Dahl: We were moving the people's spirits.
[00:11:58] Jackson Dahl: We were.
[00:11:59] Jackson Dahl: We were.
[00:12:00] John Coogan: This was a fun.
[00:12:01] John Coogan: We were kind of like, man, we got to, we got to lock down what we say.
[00:12:04] John Coogan: And we got our location.
[00:12:05] John Coogan: This guy seemed kind of crazy.
[00:12:09] Jackson Dahl: I want to talk a little bit about the business and media, which is more or less what all of
[00:12:13] Jackson Dahl: this is.
[00:12:14] Jackson Dahl: Obviously a lot to do with technology too.
[00:12:15] Jackson Dahl: Patrick was going to honest, he's interviewed with Jeremy Giffin or Kaffan a few years
[00:12:18] Jackson Dahl: ago.
[00:12:19] Jackson Dahl: They were talking about how podcasting is still low status.
[00:12:22] Jackson Dahl: Yeah.
[00:12:23] Jackson Dahl: And maybe that's less true than it was then.
[00:12:25] Jackson Dahl: But I think it's still partially true.
[00:12:28] Jackson Dahl: And I think you guys have talked a lot about how media is actually the thing.
[00:12:31] Jackson Dahl: If there's not a fun, there's not a bunch of other stuff.
[00:12:34] Jackson Dahl: Yeah.
[00:12:35] Jackson Dahl: Yeah.
[00:12:36] Jackson Dahl: Or like, so it's actually very hot now.
[00:12:38] Jordi Hays: No, no, our decision, our key decision was making it even more low status.
[00:12:42] John Coogan: So we made it.
[00:12:43] John Coogan: How can you go low?
[00:12:44] John Coogan: How can you be more low status than a podcaster?
[00:12:46] John Coogan: Be a low status than a tech, lower status than a tech podcaster.
[00:12:50] John Coogan: You can be a tech podcaster who also runs host red ads constantly.
[00:12:54] John Coogan: That's incredibly low status.
[00:12:56] John Coogan: You can also do a lot.
[00:12:57] John Coogan: We love that.
[00:12:58] John Coogan: We did ads before we had any sponsors.
[00:13:02] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[00:13:03] Jordi Hays: Right.
[00:13:04] Jordi Hays: And if you look, listen to the early episode.
[00:13:05] Jordi Hays: The first time I did it, I think I ambushed you, right?
[00:13:07] John Coogan: Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:08] Jordi Hays: And John goes, and now I need to tell you about feed ship.
[00:13:13] Jordi Hays: Feed ship is one of the world's premier yacht builders in the world.
[00:13:17] Jordi Hays: And at no point did we ever say, you're sponsored?
[00:13:21] Jordi Hays: You're sponsored.
[00:13:22] Jordi Hays: We just read.
[00:13:23] Jordi Hays: We just.
[00:13:24] Jordi Hays: We're covering.
[00:13:25] Jordi Hays: Yeah, it was just like before I tell you about the next thing.
[00:13:27] John Coogan: I need to tell you because it's amazing.
[00:13:30] John Coogan: I think we changed this now, but the YouTube channel originally had a section that said,
[00:13:35] Jordi Hays: this wouldn't be possible without.
[00:13:36] Jordi Hays: And it was like a mon, Gulf Stream feed ship.
[00:13:40] Jordi Hays: Pottaug.
[00:13:41] Jackson Dahl: Yeah.
[00:13:42] Jackson Dahl: Maybe the next level is you get sued by somebody who's mad that you're pretending they're
[00:13:45] Jackson Dahl: a sponsor of you.
[00:13:46] Jackson Dahl: You just read dialed it.
[00:13:47] Jackson Dahl: We dialed it back.
[00:13:48] Jackson Dahl: We also never said we never said they're a sponsor.
[00:13:50] Jordi Hays: No, we never did.
[00:13:51] Jordi Hays: We just enjoyed talking about them.
[00:13:53] Jackson Dahl: Yeah.
[00:13:54] Jackson Dahl: Media used to be at least more consensus, a great business when there was a lot more
[00:13:58] Jackson Dahl: scarcity.
[00:13:59] Jackson Dahl: Like we live in a world where media is sort of fundamentally abundant.
[00:14:03] Jackson Dahl: And you don't get to lean on, hey, there's only so many channels and there's only so many
[00:14:08] Jackson Dahl: hours.
[00:14:09] Jackson Dahl: And we have like, I don't want to say it's resting on your laurels, but having one of
[00:14:12] Jackson Dahl: those, it's almost like a taxi medallion or something.
[00:14:15] Jackson Dahl: There was a lot of inbuilt scarcity.
[00:14:18] Jackson Dahl: I think you guys have sort of zagged and embraced the opposite and leaned into abundance.
[00:14:23] Jackson Dahl: Quite literally, I think the feeling over the last year of the rise has partially been,
[00:14:28] Jackson Dahl: you guys just flood the airwaves.
[00:14:29] Jackson Dahl: Yeah.
[00:14:30] Jackson Dahl: You can't, there's just so much TVPN.
[00:14:32] Jackson Dahl: And yet I think there's also clearly a consideration around making sure that there's trust
[00:14:37] Jackson Dahl: and credibility and quality.
[00:14:39] Jackson Dahl: I'm curious what it's been like to balance crazy volume and frankly ramping up the volume
[00:14:44] Jackson Dahl: over the last eight months and making sure you're not just like, oh, people know about
[00:14:49] Jackson Dahl: us and as long as we show up, it's fine.
[00:14:52] Yeah, so one thing that's yet early that's worth noting is there's a lot of cable news
[00:14:57] Jordi Hays: anchors that would not survive in a free market.
[00:15:01] Jordi Hays: Yes.
[00:15:02] Jordi Hays: If they go, if they went and tried to start being a content creator on the internet, they
[00:15:06] Jordi Hays: would not win.
[00:15:07] Jordi Hays: They win because they work for a company that has distribution, that they control, right?
[00:15:13] Jordi Hays: They have a network that they can distribute content on.
[00:15:16] Jordi Hays: And so what you're getting at is that due to the internet and other factors, you have
[00:15:22] Jordi Hays: the cost of producing content and the cost of distributing content, basically go to zero.
[00:15:26] Jordi Hays: If you have a cell phone, you can be a media company.
[00:15:30] Jordi Hays: And so it is hyper competitive.
[00:15:35] Jordi Hays: We noticed in tech specifically is that there's a lot of podcasts in tech, but they're all
[00:15:43] Jordi Hays: almost the same.
[00:15:45] Jordi Hays: There was not a lot of formats, right?
[00:15:47] Jordi Hays: And so we had a lot of interview shows, not a lot of other kind of experimentation around
[00:15:52] Jordi Hays: format.
[00:15:53] Jordi Hays: And so John's initial insight of what if we did no guess, what if we just had a stack
[00:15:57] Jordi Hays: of papers and we just talked through topics and that was why the show broke through originally.
[00:16:06] Jordi Hays: After that, I think some factor is just that we show up every single day and we try to
[00:16:10] Jordi Hays: put on a great show.
[00:16:12] Jordi Hays: And so the, if you look over the last year, I don't think there are many people in the
[00:16:21] Jordi Hays: industry that have put in the number of hours that we have.
[00:16:24] Jordi Hays: So like part of it is just out working.
[00:16:26] Yeah, three hours a day is a lot, but if you look at the ratio between, it's probably six
[00:16:33] John Coogan: hours of prep that goes into every three hour show, plus what the team's prepping, it's
[00:16:37] John Coogan: probably the same ratio of input to output as many other shows.
[00:16:44] John Coogan: And so you, you can keep the quality bar high.
[00:16:49] John Coogan: There's also just the fact of like just leaning back on like authenticity and you with how fast
[00:16:55] John Coogan: we've ramped the volume.
[00:16:57] John Coogan: We certainly are not as polished as a highly produced new show with commercial breaks and
[00:17:04] John Coogan: perfect graphics.
[00:17:05] John Coogan: All of that is like the startup mentality of like iterate towards it, make the overlay
[00:17:09] John Coogan: or the chiron a little bit better every single day, make the graphics better.
[00:17:15] John Coogan: But the audience because tech loves startups, loves growth, loves iteration, I think everyone's
[00:17:22] John Coogan: really accepting of that.
[00:17:24] John Coogan: Yeah, with content, you don't have time to rest, right?
[00:17:26] Jordi Hays: If you're building enterprise software, you can build the product, you can build some
[00:17:30] Jordi Hays: features, you can build some functionality.
[00:17:32] Jordi Hays: And the entire team can go on vacation, right?
[00:17:34] Jordi Hays: For a week, they can take a long weekend and the product's still going to function as
[00:17:38] Jordi Hays: it's still going to deliver value to consumers.
[00:17:41] Jordi Hays: With news, we're in the news business, right?
[00:17:43] Jordi Hays: If we're not like, there is no, definitely in the news business, is that how you think
[00:17:47] Jackson Dahl: about it?
[00:17:48] Jordi Hays: That's so like another, we can maybe go down that, that kind of path in a second, but there's
[00:17:54] Jordi Hays: no value to TBPN if we don't show up.
[00:17:57] Jordi Hays: It's very little to the log value as opposed to consider David Sanders founders, but
[00:18:04] John Coogan: yes, or our quiet or invests the best.
[00:18:06] John Coogan: Right.
[00:18:07] John Coogan: And so we took a barbell approach and so that is, that means you have to show up every
[00:18:12] Jordi Hays: day, but it's also an opportunity to iterate every day.
[00:18:15] Jordi Hays: So what we, like a baker gets to show up every day, they make bread, but every single day
[00:18:20] Jordi Hays: they can change tiny little things, they can change.
[00:18:23] Jordi Hays: I've, I really don't understand the process that we're going to make bread, but you can
[00:18:27] Jordi Hays: understand like, what if you change the temperature, what if you change the amount of yeast, what
[00:18:30] Jordi Hays: if you change the amount of flour?
[00:18:32] Jordi Hays: And so that, when we think about making the show, every single day, we, you know, won the
[00:18:38] Jordi Hays: product kind of flows through all of us, it flows through the team, it flows through
[00:18:42] Jordi Hays: us.
[00:18:43] Jordi Hays: And so we know when the product is great, we feel it, we end the show every day, and we're
[00:18:48] Jordi Hays: talking through, okay, this section could have been better, that story.
[00:18:51] Jordi Hays: We didn't, we didn't have the right, even information to give the best sort of takes
[00:18:56] Jordi Hays: on that.
[00:18:58] Jordi Hays: That sex, that interview was really slow.
[00:19:00] Jordi Hays: We got to like, adjust the schedule for tomorrow to make sure that doesn't happen again.
[00:19:03] Jordi Hays: And so every single day is an opportunity to make the product better, and you don't have
[00:19:07] Jordi Hays: any opportunity to rest and sort of sit back.
[00:19:12] Jordi Hays: And there's no, there's never been a moment where we were like, oh, that was a great interview.
[00:19:17] Jordi Hays: Like we can take the next week, we, this week will be easy, right?
[00:19:20] Jordi Hays: Like every single day is new and bringing that, trying to really compound it.
[00:19:24] Jordi Hays: And I think we've done a good job of that, where it's like, if you look at just one shot
[00:19:28] Jordi Hays: of the show every single day over the last year, you would see very clearly there's like
[00:19:33] Jordi Hays: minor iterations happening every single day.
[00:19:35] Jordi Hays: And some of that is like actually in the content and the ordering and things like that.
[00:19:40] Jordi Hays: But every single day we've learned something new about the show and how to make it better.
[00:19:44] Jordi Hays: And I think we'll do that for a very, very, very long time.
[00:19:48] Jordi Hays: And what ends up being interesting is that if you want to, we've had a lot of people
[00:19:54] Jordi Hays: be inspired by TBPN, we've had a lot of people be a little too inspired, maybe copying,
[00:20:01] Jordi Hays: but going from zero to people see what we're doing today, going from zero to what we are
[00:20:07] Jordi Hays: today would be like even like almost impossible for us.
[00:20:10] Jordi Hays: Like it would be like, it would be very, very challenging because we started with a once
[00:20:15] Jordi Hays: a week show, one camera, two mics talking through some posts.
[00:20:21] Jordi Hays: Then we added another show, then we added another camera, then we added new microphones,
[00:20:25] Jordi Hays: then we added this, then we added an overlay, then we added live, then we added guests,
[00:20:28] Jordi Hays: then we added five days a week, then we added new channels, then we did, you know, just
[00:20:33] Jordi Hays: like this constant kind of compounding.
[00:20:35] Jordi Hays: Even the first episode, I mean, I think a lot of people don't realize this, but the wide
[00:20:39] John Coogan: shot on the first episode is technically a visual effect shot because I put, I wanted
[00:20:46] John Coogan: a more moody cinematic lighting setup, so I put the light stand behind us so that we
[00:20:52] John Coogan: would be backlit, so we'd kind of have this dark room vibe, and I wanted something more
[00:20:58] John Coogan: cinematic, yeah, exactly.
[00:21:00] John Coogan: But when you do that, if you don't have a huge lighting rig that can actually rig something
[00:21:05] John Coogan: out of frame to the ceiling, you wind up with a light stand in the background.
[00:21:09] John Coogan: Eventually, we just wrapped a mirror and flag around it because I was sick of doing the
[00:21:13] John Coogan: VFX, but I went in and painted out, I mean, I think it did like AI insertion or whatever,
[00:21:20] John Coogan: but I did like content-aware fill and then overlayed that over the shot, and so you can't
[00:21:24] John Coogan: see the light in the shot, but we're lit from the back and it has this kind of like hanging
[00:21:30] John Coogan: out in an old school law firm vibe, and even that was like a very considerative decision
[00:21:36] John Coogan: that was built on, you know, I was making videos for years and had to experiment with like,
[00:21:41] John Coogan: what happens when you just point the light directly at your face, well, it looks kind of
[00:21:45] John Coogan: bland, but if you put it off to the side, it looks a little bit better, what if you put
[00:21:47] John Coogan: it behind them, it looks even better, and kind of iterating through that.
[00:21:51] John Coogan: So yeah, it's a tough challenge to try and like clone all this on day one, I think that
[00:21:57] John Coogan: it's something that, you know, it's fine to be inspired by a TVP and be like, I want
[00:22:01] John Coogan: to take media seriously, and maybe you start as like, you know, some things are inspired,
[00:22:06] John Coogan: but like all the different things, they're all like happy accidents that like came together
[00:22:11] John Coogan: different ideas and they kind of grew and found their place within the show, and it would
[00:22:17] John Coogan: be very hard to try and like, yeah, it would be very hard to like copy paste all of this.
[00:22:21] John Coogan: Well, it would also be, it would have been hard for you guys to plan.
[00:22:24] Jackson Dahl: Totally.
[00:22:25] Jackson Dahl: A whole bunch of that stuff.
[00:22:26] There's another element of this that is maybe a little less true for you given the YouTube
[00:22:30] Jackson Dahl: stuff, but I think still broadly true, which is you both have been serial entrepreneurs
[00:22:35] Jackson Dahl: and done a whole bunch of different types of things.
[00:22:37] Jackson Dahl: You are in this.
[00:22:39] Jackson Dahl: You are both entrepreneurs and you are also talent.
[00:22:43] Jackson Dahl: There's a line where you say, we are the talent and we like to remain the talent and not
[00:22:46] Jackson Dahl: build an empire.
[00:22:49] Jackson Dahl: And I think on one hand, like the world has certainly started, I think this is also something
[00:22:53] Jackson Dahl: you said, like because of the internet media has rewarded networks, like platform networks
[00:22:59] Jackson Dahl: and it was rewarded creators.
[00:23:01] Jackson Dahl: Yes.
[00:23:02] Jackson Dahl: And the middle is really, really hard.
[00:23:03] Jackson Dahl: The barbell is a super key concept that we love and we want to keep coming back to
[00:23:07] John Coogan: as much as possible in this.
[00:23:10] The other element of this that I think at least coming from the business world and from
[00:23:14] Jackson Dahl: the entrepreneurial world is on some level, you're like kind of labor.
[00:23:17] Jackson Dahl: You're not really capital.
[00:23:18] Jackson Dahl: Yeah.
[00:23:19] Jackson Dahl: Obviously they're elements where you're having sort of leverage.
[00:23:23] Jackson Dahl: And so I'm curious what that maybe even especially more so for you, like as someone who I think
[00:23:29] was always thought a lot about distribution but was not in the spotlight.
[00:23:35] Jackson Dahl: What that experience has been to sort of manage the dual role as the guy on camera and the
[00:23:41] Jackson Dahl: showrunner and the business guy, like all of those things at once, obviously some people
[00:23:45] Jackson Dahl: do.
[00:23:46] But that's a little less typical for the typical internet creator.
[00:23:51] John Coogan: Yeah, I mean, often like with other more mature shows, there's people in every seat and the
[00:23:57] John Coogan: talent comes in to host the show and that's to merely one piece and then there's a whole
[00:24:02] John Coogan: ad sales organization and HR and finance or whatever.
[00:24:07] I think it's actually not that hard because we've both done it multiple times and you
[00:24:12] John Coogan: sit on top of all these different SaaS products.
[00:24:15] John Coogan: So you can really leverage software in a lot of places, whether it's, you know, set up
[00:24:21] John Coogan: a payroll software or whatever you need to like build your business.
[00:24:25] John Coogan: It's pretty, it's pretty turnkey now to like set up the business around it.
[00:24:29] John Coogan: Of course there's like other key decisions, but I think the key flywheel that we really
[00:24:35] John Coogan: embraced early on was I would push as hard as possible and iterating the content, finding
[00:24:40] John Coogan: new formats, up leveling the production and Jordy was really good at the business side,
[00:24:45] John Coogan: setting up the business, but also bringing on advertisers and building the vision of
[00:24:49] John Coogan: what that flywheel could be and once that flywheel got going and paid for this ultra dome and
[00:24:54] John Coogan: whatnot and we were able to take this way more seriously than I think a lot of at least
[00:24:59] John Coogan: my previous YouTube channel, I never really turned it into a business and so I never really
[00:25:05] John Coogan: thought about like, oh, what would it look like if I put 100K into this?
[00:25:09] John Coogan: Yeah, yeah, it's like my Twitter account is how I thought about my YouTube account.
[00:25:14] John Coogan: I didn't think about it as like, okay, well if you go and find partners that can actually
[00:25:21] John Coogan: invest and promote or pay to advertising the content, you can make better content and
[00:25:27] John Coogan: of course that makes sense.
[00:25:28] I never really took a plunge with the video essay or documentary channel, but with this
[00:25:32] John Coogan: like those two things aligned really, really quickly and so we were able to just like
[00:25:36] there was, it was very easy for us in just the course of like a couple months to go
[00:25:41] John Coogan: from like, oh, this is kind of cool to like, let's invest everything in this and put
[00:25:46] John Coogan: every dollar possible into it and every moment of time because this can like really feed
[00:25:51] John Coogan: off of it.
[00:25:52] John Coogan: Yeah, as much as it was unplanned, right?
[00:25:54] Jordi Hays: We didn't plan to, we didn't have a crystal ball and say to ourselves, like, if you would
[00:26:01] Jordi Hays: ask either of us a year ago, maybe not a year ago because we had started doing the show,
[00:26:07] Jordi Hays: but two years ago, do you have any interest in, would you have any interest in being on
[00:26:11] Jordi Hays: camera for three hours a day, creating some type of like technology television show?
[00:26:17] Jordi Hays: And we would have said like, maybe we'd hear it out, but it certainly wasn't on the
[00:26:22] Jordi Hays: roadmap.
[00:26:23] Jordi Hays: And at the same time when you look back through our careers, it feels like TBPN is the
[00:26:29] Jordi Hays: natural evolution of everything that we've worked on, right?
[00:26:31] Jordi Hays: I, uh, decade ago, I, uh, spent a summer helping a podcast monetized for the first time.
[00:26:38] Jordi Hays: They had gotten to top 10 in the, in the, in the, in the fitness charts and they hadn't
[00:26:44] Jordi Hays: monetized it all.
[00:26:46] Jordi Hays: They had somebody reach out to them and say, hey, like, I like the show.
[00:26:48] Jordi Hays: Could I sponsor?
[00:26:49] Jordi Hays: And they were like, sure, like we, we were doing this for fun, but if we could make some
[00:26:54] Jordi Hays: money from it, then great.
[00:26:55] Jordi Hays: Um, and I ultimately helped them add a bunch of other sponsors and kind of learn the
[00:26:58] Jordi Hays: business side of that, um, that work ultimately turned into a company called branded native,
[00:27:03] Jordi Hays: which is a YouTube ad network that's still running and growing to this day.
[00:27:07] Jordi Hays: And so through building branded native, I did literally thousands of advertising deals
[00:27:13] Jordi Hays: between companies and creators of all different types, right?
[00:27:16] Jordi Hays: So mom and pop creators, established media companies like Donut Media, we talked about them
[00:27:21] Jordi Hays: earlier on the show.
[00:27:22] Jordi Hays: And so I had done thousands of, uh, of deals on the revenue side of what we, of, of the
[00:27:27] Jordi Hays: kind of business that we're building.
[00:27:29] Jordi Hays: And then went on to build party around, which is when we met and, uh, that was taking everything
[00:27:35] Jordi Hays: I knew about media.
[00:27:37] Jordi Hays: And then, uh, really, when you look at party rounds best work, it was like entertaining
[00:27:42] Jordi Hays: the industry, right?
[00:27:43] Jordi Hays: We would do things that got a lot of attention and we'd funnel that attention into the, into
[00:27:47] Jordi Hays: our FinTech product.
[00:27:48] Jordi Hays: But ultimately when I look back in the work that I'm most personally proud of from that,
[00:27:53] Jordi Hays: from that era that I can say, like, this wouldn't have happened without me.
[00:27:57] Jordi Hays: It's the effectively, like, the media side.
[00:28:00] Jordi Hays: And so I'd got to experience having, I think we had like marketing market fit, right?
[00:28:05] Jordi Hays: At a time when we didn't have, uh, the product at that time, you know, kind of, you know,
[00:28:11] Jordi Hays: we had a lot of demand right during the craziness of 2021.
[00:28:14] Jordi Hays: Um, but, uh, but like taking that and then you fast forward to starting, uh, this show,
[00:28:21] Jordi Hays: it's like, John had been, if you look back in like, Soilin is one of the most iconic,
[00:28:26] Jordi Hays: it's the most iconic CPG company ever in the history of like tech specifically, right?
[00:28:32] Jordi Hays: So, uh, when you look back and you can find like, it's like, okay, it makes sense that,
[00:28:36] Jordi Hays: you know, a decade later, John would, would have like a show for the industry, right?
[00:28:41] Jordi Hays: A, a media product.
[00:28:42] Jordi Hays: And so, uh, you add John spending years like, understanding the craft of creating content,
[00:28:48] Jordi Hays: right?
[00:28:49] Jordi Hays: And you combine everything I knew from the entertainment side, um, in terms of just like
[00:28:54] Jordi Hays: creating things that were entertaining and fun.
[00:28:57] Jordi Hays: And then everything I knew from the revenue side of, of modern media businesses.
[00:29:02] Jordi Hays: And then you apply John's understanding of the craft of making content and understanding,
[00:29:07] Jordi Hays: understanding content at a deeper level.
[00:29:09] Jordi Hays: And, um, the thing that I always come back to is, uh, John's understanding that with content,
[00:29:14] Jordi Hays: your product is not like the, the, the file that you upload to YouTube.
[00:29:18] Jordi Hays: It's the format of what you're doing.
[00:29:21] Jordi Hays: And so, all, you add all of those key insights together and I feel like we both started working
[00:29:26] Jordi Hays: on TVPN like a decade ago, right?
[00:29:29] Jordi Hays: And so, uh, able to like stack those learnings and then combine that with, uh, we don't take
[00:29:37] Jordi Hays: ourselves very seriously.
[00:29:38] Jordi Hays: And I think that, uh, that, uh, that's an important part of the show, right?
[00:29:42] Jordi Hays: We're gonna have good takes sometimes.
[00:29:44] Jordi Hays: We're gonna have bad takes sometimes.
[00:29:46] Jordi Hays: Uh, we, we love the industry.
[00:29:49] Jordi Hays: Uh, but at the same time, we can recognize the silliness, but one thing that's always been,
[00:29:54] Jordi Hays: uh, uh, that we've always, uh, maintained is taking the work super seriously.
[00:29:58] Jordi Hays: And so we can have a lot of fun.
[00:30:00] Jordi Hays: It's fun to go to work.
[00:30:02] Jordi Hays: I look forward to starting the day every day, but we're taking the actual work very seriously.
[00:30:06] Jordi Hays: And part of that is we're forced to, right?
[00:30:08] Jordi Hays: Like we have to physically speak the product into existence, right?
[00:30:12] Jordi Hays: We have to perform.
[00:30:14] Jordi Hays: And so if we're not having, if we're not having fun or it's not going well, like we have
[00:30:18] Jordi Hays: to like viscerally, we've all met founders that will like things aren't going well and
[00:30:22] Jordi Hays: they can kind of check out, right?
[00:30:23] Jordi Hays: They can kind of just like, so you can tell.
[00:30:25] Jordi Hays: Yeah, you can tell when somebody is on camera and they're not having fun, you can tell.
[00:30:30] Jackson Dahl: Yeah.
[00:30:32] John Coogan: 100% there is.
[00:30:35] Uh, I think there's something that's pretty common in, at least in the creator part of the
[00:30:38] Jackson Dahl: world, but increasingly as people gain audience, um, part of it is audience capture,
[00:30:44] Jackson Dahl: but part of it is just like the simple ego that comes when a critical part of why you're
[00:30:48] Jackson Dahl: successful is your distribution.
[00:30:50] Jackson Dahl: Um, I'm curious how, obviously the one benefit you guys have is that there's two of you.
[00:30:57] Jackson Dahl: And so I'm sure a huge part of this is pushing each other and challenging each other.
[00:31:00] Jackson Dahl: But I'm curious.
[00:31:02] Yeah, how you're able to, whether it be between the two of you or are there other people,
[00:31:07] Jackson Dahl: sort of like maintain a healthy amount of ego and also be checked or challenged.
[00:31:13] Jackson Dahl: Yeah, I was thinking about that just today.
[00:31:14] John Coogan: So we've been, uh, we've been growing this newsletter and, uh, every day I write a couple hundred
[00:31:21] John Coogan: years, just to kind of summarize my thoughts on like the current thing or whatever is in my mind
[00:31:26] John Coogan: that, uh, and, and I, and I realized like, there's a little bit of like, I'm writing for like,
[00:31:32] John Coogan: a, we post them on X as well.
[00:31:34] John Coogan: And we're kind of writing for that audience and I have a vague idea of who's on the newsletter
[00:31:39] John Coogan: subscription, but I'm not super in there.
[00:31:41] John Coogan: Uh, and I was thinking like, really like, I'm writing this for Jordy.
[00:31:44] John Coogan: Like I'm, I'm pitching an idea to Jordy and it's like, there's a little bit of like
[00:31:50] John Coogan: Jordy capture in the sense of like, I'm trying to, I'm trying to find something,
[00:31:53] John Coogan: I'm not trying to find something that I'm like, you're happy.
[00:31:54] John Coogan: I'm actually trying to make something that will make you like tee off.
[00:31:58] John Coogan: Yeah, I don't want to bore you.
[00:31:59] John Coogan: I want you to be able to, the newsletter, the newsletter is we, we, we meet at 630 every
[00:32:05] Jordi Hays: morning.
[00:32:05] Jordi Hays: We try not to adjust the schedule at all.
[00:32:08] Jordi Hays: We've tried it.
[00:32:09] Jordi Hays: We've tried to fit a breakfast in with external people.
[00:32:13] Jordi Hays: It doesn't work at all.
[00:32:14] Jordi Hays: And so we try to have the exact same morning, every morning leading up into the show.
[00:32:18] Jordi Hays: And our, the, the process that's worked well as we show up and from 630 to 915, we just
[00:32:25] Jordi Hays: talk about what we're planning to talk about on the show and we debate a bunch of stuff.
[00:32:29] Jordi Hays: And we sort of sharpen our thinking and just go back and forth.
[00:32:32] Jordi Hays: And so the entire time that we're working out in the morning, uh, it is just back and
[00:32:37] Jordi Hays: forth on whatever is top of mind, whatever we think we're going to be talking about, um,
[00:32:42] Jordi Hays: the most.
[00:32:43] Jordi Hays: And so by the time we show up to the office, usually I get immediately start getting on
[00:32:45] Jordi Hays: Zoom meetings for whatever we're working on in the business.
[00:32:48] Jordi Hays: And John starts just writing.
[00:32:50] Jordi Hays: And so I've never had writer's block because I'm just kind of like transcribing the discussion
[00:32:54] John Coogan: that we already had.
[00:32:55] John Coogan: Yeah.
[00:32:56] John Coogan: But I'm like, like, yeah, I'm just kind of like rephrasing it to be like, oh, there's
[00:33:00] John Coogan: some data points.
[00:33:01] John Coogan: You know how if you're in an argument with somebody, eventually you go, chat you, but you
[00:33:04] John Coogan: look up the facts, get some facts.
[00:33:07] John Coogan: And so I do a little bit of that.
[00:33:08] John Coogan: And then I bring that to the show and we kind of rehash what we've already talked about,
[00:33:11] John Coogan: but we kind of know the general parameters of like the, the key discussion for the day.
[00:33:17] John Coogan: And then that can kind of like lead to, there's been like maybe two shows where one of us
[00:33:21] Jordi Hays: like got arrived late and you just got to kind of go right, you got like get to the, get
[00:33:26] Jordi Hays: to the studio and you have like 20 minutes and you go live and that feels just terrible
[00:33:30] Jordi Hays: because it's, it's really like, it's such an important part of the day that whatever,
[00:33:35] Jordi Hays: it's effectively three hours of just like fun debate on one.
[00:33:38] Jordi Hays: It's also a very unique thing about this particular show.
[00:33:42] John Coogan: Like if you go to any traditional media like Daily Show, like there is a room of writers
[00:33:50] John Coogan: that are putting together a monologue and it's very rare at the time of the hosts are
[00:33:56] John Coogan: doing all of the work.
[00:33:58] John Coogan: And I think that, yeah.
[00:34:00] Jordi Hays: Sometimes I see clips from other, other shows and I just assume that everyone does their
[00:34:05] Jordi Hays: own homework and I don't think that's the case at all.
[00:34:09] Jordi Hays: But that's part of what makes the show great is that we want to keep that conversational
[00:34:14] Jordi Hays: feel, right?
[00:34:15] Jordi Hays: This is, this is two people trying to understand the world with guests, right?
[00:34:21] Jordi Hays: And we try to lean on guests.
[00:34:22] Jordi Hays: We can't be, we talk on any given week, we're covering 30 different industries.
[00:34:31] Jordi Hays: You know, every, you know, there's such a broad spectrum and so we can't possibly be
[00:34:34] Jordi Hays: experts.
[00:34:35] Jordi Hays: It has to be conversational and it has to feel like you're sitting here, you're hanging out
[00:34:40] Jordi Hays: with us and you're just trying to understand the world.
[00:34:43] And so even from like we have a lot of aesthetics of linear TV and in traditional media, but
[00:34:50] John Coogan: I think that our audience generally holds us to the bar of a live stream where it's
[00:34:56] John Coogan: allowed together.
[00:34:57] John Coogan: It's a little bit of, it has the aesthetics of the polished TV that has a whole writer's
[00:35:02] John Coogan: room and a teleprompter, but there isn't one and it's much more like watching somebody
[00:35:08] John Coogan: split through the news on their computer on a live stream like you'd see on Twitch.
[00:35:13] John Coogan: Yeah.
[00:35:14] John Coogan: Just chatting, right?
[00:35:15] John Coogan: And so we've kind of like pulled these two things together, like Twitch just chatting
[00:35:19] John Coogan: and then, you know, traditional NBC, ABC, Fox or whatever and kind of combine those a little
[00:35:26] John Coogan: bit to kind of create this new thing, maybe it kind of hits different.
[00:35:31] There's also just like, I'm sure you guys have talked to Center about this too, where he's
[00:35:34] Jackson Dahl: like, he's had people be like, why don't you hire somebody to read the books for you?
[00:35:37] Jackson Dahl: Oh, yeah.
[00:35:38] Jackson Dahl: So you're so not getting like, oh my gosh, if there's like, oh, yeah, there were 25 interns
[00:35:45] Jackson Dahl: who came in this morning and they all told me that they showed me all the lines they wrote
[00:35:48] Jackson Dahl: for you guys just.
[00:35:49] Jackson Dahl: Yeah.
[00:35:50] Jackson Dahl: There's only one intern in today.
[00:35:53] John Coogan: Yeah, it's clear that it's you guys.
[00:35:57] Jackson Dahl: One last thing on the business thing, I guess would be, and you started to talk about
[00:36:00] Jackson Dahl: just the reciprocal nature between the content and the business.
[00:36:05] Jackson Dahl: Why also we talked about the low status part, but why do you love about the business of
[00:36:11] Jackson Dahl: advertising and why is it such an empowering?
[00:36:13] Jackson Dahl: Like advertising kind of gets a bad rap, maybe especially in tech ironically.
[00:36:17] Jackson Dahl: What about advertising is so powerful?
[00:36:19] Jackson Dahl: Price discrimination.
[00:36:21] There are people that follow the show that are billionaires.
[00:36:25] John Coogan: There are people that follow the show that are in college.
[00:36:29] John Coogan: And so if you find a great product that you can, that where that company can get both
[00:36:36] John Coogan: of those people as a client and extract literally one billion dollars from the multi-billionaire
[00:36:42] John Coogan: who runs a massive company.
[00:36:43] John Coogan: And then also help the college students start their first company and extract.
[00:36:48] John Coogan: Maybe win them for lie 200 bucks a month on an ASAS revenue once they get into YC or
[00:36:53] John Coogan: something like you can actually capture value from both.
[00:36:56] John Coogan: And that's only possible with advertising.
[00:36:58] John Coogan: If you're selling t-shirts, the billionaire shows up and says like a t-shirt and you say,
[00:37:03] John Coogan: do you mind paying 100 bucks?
[00:37:05] John Coogan: Yeah, I think what independent media companies and creators love more than subscribe, like
[00:37:12] Jordi Hays: what they love about the subscription business model is that they have some amount of revenue
[00:37:16] Jordi Hays: consistency, right?
[00:37:17] Jordi Hays: They like feeling and it's really easy for them to think, okay, if I get to a thousand subscriptions
[00:37:22] Jordi Hays: if I get to 10,000, if I get to 100,000.
[00:37:24] Jordi Hays: It's money on that.
[00:37:25] Jordi Hays: Yeah, yeah, that or just it's really easy to understand, like, okay, I can-
[00:37:29] Jordi Hays: Life styles just barely-
[00:37:31] John Coogan: It's predictable, right?
[00:37:32] Jordi Hays: And so what I love, what I love and why we were excited about advertising was that, I mean,
[00:37:41] Jordi Hays: obviously for what John said, but also there's-
[00:37:44] Jordi Hays: We have never charged a member of our audience a dollar, right?
[00:37:48] Jordi Hays: And over a year we haven't even sold merch, right?
[00:37:53] Jordi Hays: All the merch that we've made, we've just given away.
[00:37:56] Jordi Hays: And that is a beautiful thing that there's like roughly 15 or so companies that have like
[00:38:03] Jordi Hays: effectively financed TbPN so that it's free for the entire world, right?
[00:38:08] Jordi Hays: And I actually think that's a beautiful, beautiful thing.
[00:38:11] Jordi Hays: I think where advertising gets a bad rap is non-targeted advertising.
[00:38:18] Jordi Hays: So if you're getting ads that-
[00:38:20] Jordi Hays: Every once in a while I'll get an ad that I'm like, why did I get this ad?
[00:38:23] Jordi Hays: That's like, that's like actually not a great experience.
[00:38:26] Jordi Hays: And then high, high ad loads.
[00:38:29] Jordi Hays: So like, we have a higher volume of ads in the average podcast, but we actually have a
[00:38:32] Jordi Hays: high, much lower percentage of the actual content is advertising, right?
[00:38:36] Jordi Hays: We just support-
[00:38:37] Jordi Hays: Yeah, so Tb is-
[00:38:38] Jordi Hays: Let me watch a Tb show.
[00:38:39] John Coogan: It's 22 minutes and a 30 minute segment.
[00:38:41] John Coogan: That's in 10 minutes of ads.
[00:38:43] John Coogan: We're not, you know, we're an 880 minute show, three hours.
[00:38:48] John Coogan: There might be five or 10 minutes of total ads across that, which is less than 10%.
[00:38:53] John Coogan: And the content in the ad is actually much closer together.
[00:38:55] Jackson Dahl: Totally.
[00:38:56] Jackson Dahl: Obviously that's been the case for-
[00:38:57] Jackson Dahl: One, maybe I guess one other criticism would be that-
[00:39:01] broadly, not necessarily for you guys is that-
[00:39:02] Jackson Dahl: For that's-
[00:39:03] Jackson Dahl: It just shakes the incentives.
[00:39:05] Jackson Dahl: Yes, so here's the thing, as much as possible, we're trying to work with the most boring
[00:39:09] Jordi Hays: companies on earth.
[00:39:10] Jordi Hays: They're not boring to us.
[00:39:11] Jordi Hays: Right, right.
[00:39:12] Jordi Hays: They're companies that the world does not wake up every day and say, I want to learn about
[00:39:18] Jordi Hays: this company.
[00:39:19] Jordi Hays: Right?
[00:39:20] Jordi Hays: And so we sell attention to those companies, right?
[00:39:24] Jordi Hays: And there's a lot of companies in the world that should not be waking up in the morning,
[00:39:28] Jordi Hays: thinking like, how can I be the next clueless?
[00:39:30] Jordi Hays: Right.
[00:39:31] Jordi Hays: Like, they should be thinking, how do I build a, you know, fantastic product?
[00:39:35] Jordi Hays: That I can, you know, get a meaningful amount of our market and figure out new product,
[00:39:40] Jordi Hays: you know, like, there's so many other things that they should work on.
[00:39:43] Jordi Hays: And so there are companies like OpenAI that doesn't have to spend a lot of money on advertising
[00:39:47] Jordi Hays: because people just talk about OpenAI all day long, right?
[00:39:50] Jordi Hays: We cover-
[00:39:51] Jordi Hays: There's not a day that is passed, probably, that we haven't talked about OpenAI, right?
[00:39:55] Jordi Hays: You have the birth of a new hyper-scale it, right?
[00:39:57] Jordi Hays: It's the thing that people are fixated on.
[00:40:01] Jordi Hays: And so, you know, we even choke that we expect venture capital firms to eventually realize
[00:40:06] Jordi Hays: instead of making a derivative podcast that people that's not actually going to be a great
[00:40:11] Jordi Hays: product, why did I take that money that I was going to spend on producing a show that
[00:40:16] Jordi Hays: no one's going to listen to and just advertise with great podcasts that I love, right?
[00:40:21] Jordi Hays: And so that will happen eventually.
[00:40:22] Jordi Hays: It's already happened in finance, right?
[00:40:25] Jordi Hays: Flip through the Wall Street Journal, flip through any important magazine and you'll find
[00:40:29] Jordi Hays: advertising.
[00:40:30] Jordi Hays: This X has a podcast, Blackstone, BlackRock.
[00:40:33] John Coogan: I'm pretty sure they both have podcasts, but they also advertise on F1 or TV or CNBC,
[00:40:39] John Coogan: like they run ads because they need awareness.
[00:40:41] John Coogan: Yeah, that's a great point.
[00:40:43] John Coogan: Yeah, the main thing is content, content just wants to be free.
[00:40:47] Jordi Hays: Ask any creator that I would even say Ben Thompson probably realizes that he wouldn't,
[00:40:55] Jordi Hays: his show was born at a time when X was happy to promote your links, right?
[00:41:00] Jordi Hays: And he was super early to a generational trend and it would be very hard to recreate that
[00:41:07] Jordi Hays: of having this massive base of paid subscribers.
[00:41:11] Jordi Hays: There was just less competition, I think, for truly great technology analysis.
[00:41:17] Jordi Hays: I have a cavity.
[00:41:18] Jordi Hays: And yeah, and the other thing is we wanted to create a business that didn't require us to
[00:41:24] do other things, right?
[00:41:25] Jordi Hays: It pains me that for the last however many years, everyone has been on this path of, I make
[00:41:33] Jordi Hays: great, I make content that's great enough to justify doing something else.
[00:41:38] Jordi Hays: And every time somebody does that, they then are in competition with somebody who doesn't
[00:41:43] Jordi Hays: have the other.
[00:41:44] Jordi Hays: Yes, yes.
[00:41:45] Jordi Hays: And so, like, we joke about venture capitalists, like taking a lot of vacations, but if you
[00:41:49] Jordi Hays: were trying to make a media business and you're competing in a market where there are
[00:41:53] Jordi Hays: a bunch of people that want your audience, they want the attention that you have, and
[00:41:57] Jordi Hays: they don't have a venture fund, and then you go and you're a media creator and you start
[00:42:03] Jordi Hays: a venture fund.
[00:42:04] Jordi Hays: It's like, well, who's your customer now?
[00:42:05] Jordi Hays: Is it your LPs?
[00:42:07] Jordi Hays: Is it the founders?
[00:42:08] Jordi Hays: Is it your audience, right?
[00:42:09] Jordi Hays: I generally predict that people will continue to distract themselves, but we wanted to build
[00:42:16] Jordi Hays: a business that didn't, that we weren't like, okay, now we've had a little success.
[00:42:21] Jordi Hays: We have some momentum, now let's diversify, right?
[00:42:23] Jordi Hays: It's like staying ruthlessly focused on the content itself because that's what our audience
[00:42:29] Jordi Hays: deserves, right?
[00:42:32] Jordi Hays: Every single day, I wish that I had an extra three hours to prep for some story that we
[00:42:37] Jordi Hays: want to talk about because people are tuning into the show every day and they deserve to
[00:42:41] Jordi Hays: get the best possible experience.
[00:42:43] Jordi Hays: They don't care that I, if I were to start a venture fund or we have a venture fund
[00:42:46] Jordi Hays: and we're like, oh, yeah, like, couldn't prep for the show this morning because I was
[00:42:49] Jordi Hays: trying to win this deal, right?
[00:42:51] Jordi Hays: Why does the audience care about that?
[00:42:53] Jordi Hays: We're all doing that in so many little ways throughout, like, it's just so tempting to
[00:42:58] Jackson Dahl: focus on like, just, oh, just do a little bit else.
[00:43:01] Jackson Dahl: It even happens within the context of we have been, you know, extremely focused on media,
[00:43:07] John Coogan: we haven't done a fund or company or spin out tech product or anything like that, but
[00:43:11] John Coogan: even within the, even within TBPN, we've thought about, you know, is the newsletter too
[00:43:18] John Coogan: much of a distraction?
[00:43:19] John Coogan: Or is it actually synergistic?
[00:43:21] John Coogan: I think we got into a place where it's synergistic because it serves as a way to prep the show,
[00:43:27] John Coogan: it serves as a way to prep discussions that will happen on the show.
[00:43:31] John Coogan: Any actual newsletter is exactly what we're going to do.
[00:43:33] John Coogan: Yeah, and it's the most efficient way to consume the show, right?
[00:43:37] Jordi Hays: Watching, if you have the luxury of watching the livestream every day, it really is luxury,
[00:43:41] Jordi Hays: right?
[00:43:42] Jordi Hays: And it's not an efficient way to get news.
[00:43:45] Jordi Hays: And that's okay, right?
[00:43:46] Jordi Hays: People for generations have liked having a TV on in the office and doing their workday
[00:43:51] Jordi Hays: and being able to sort of passively understand what's going on through that.
[00:43:56] Jordi Hays: But the newsletter, again, is like the most efficient way if you want TBPN in two minutes,
[00:44:02] Jordi Hays: that's how you do it.
[00:44:03] Jordi Hays: Yes.
[00:44:05] Jackson Dahl: This show began as something called technology brothers.
[00:44:09] Jackson Dahl: You mentioned it earlier, part of your own in capital, like, I think more than almost
[00:44:12] Jackson Dahl: anything else, you were amazing at tapping into the technology culture's site guist.
[00:44:16] Jackson Dahl: Obviously, you've done over 250 videos, not only tech, but a whole lot about the business
[00:44:23] Jackson Dahl: of and the culture around technology and its entrepreneurs.
[00:44:26] Jackson Dahl: I think tech is often criticized as being lacking in culture or unaware of culture, but
[00:44:33] Jackson Dahl: clearly technology has its own culture as well.
[00:44:35] Jackson Dahl: And in many ways, as much as this is a show about technology and business, it does
[00:44:39] Jackson Dahl: is show about the culture of the technology industry.
[00:44:42] Can you talk about maybe the way you relate to that or think about, like, are you, is that
[00:44:47] Jackson Dahl: some of your kind of, like, consciously, like maybe another way of asking, I think the
[00:44:53] Jordi Hays: meta, I think technology is too inspired by technology.
[00:44:58] Jordi Hays: If you think about, best example of this is like the browser company, right?
[00:45:05] Jordi Hays: The whole way to name a company and they were able, like, that was just the naming of
[00:45:11] Jordi Hays: that company was valuable because it stood out, it was like, wait, this is a consumer
[00:45:15] Jordi Hays: tech company that are creating a browser, they have this, like, you know, cursive logo
[00:45:19] Jordi Hays: mark, it just stood out immediately, right?
[00:45:22] Jordi Hays: And you could tell that it was inspired.
[00:45:25] It wasn't like they were the first company, they weren't the first company in the world
[00:45:29] Jordi Hays: to name themselves like the blank company.
[00:45:31] Jordi Hays: Yes.
[00:45:32] Jordi Hays: People in tech to do it and do it really well.
[00:45:34] Jordi Hays: And since then, over the years, we've, you know, we've seen like probably a hundred companies
[00:45:39] Jordi Hays: created with that, right?
[00:45:41] Jordi Hays: And it pains me every single time because the, the, the, the, one of the things that people
[00:45:49] Jordi Hays: in tech do is they just copy from within the industry, right?
[00:45:52] Jordi Hays: Because we've been trained, we've been retrained to say that, like, you know, the best people
[00:45:57] Jordi Hays: copy, right?
[00:45:58] Jordi Hays: Great artist steel.
[00:46:00] Jordi Hays: And it's like, I think that great artist actually steel from elsewhere, right?
[00:46:05] Jordi Hays: They're not like, they're not like, oh, this great artist did something.
[00:46:08] Jordi Hays: I want to be a great artist.
[00:46:09] Jordi Hays: So I'm going to do a guard exactly like copy of the Mona Lisa.
[00:46:12] John Coogan: Great.
[00:46:13] John Coogan: It is almost definitionally like diverse in the books.
[00:46:15] Jordi Hays: Of course.
[00:46:16] Jordi Hays: Yeah, yeah, diverse, diverse inputs.
[00:46:17] Jordi Hays: And so, so I think what we, what we, you know, one of the things that we've done well,
[00:46:22] Jordi Hays: I did, you know, I did this historically with, with, with kind of everything that I worked
[00:46:27] Jordi Hays: on is like, it's, oh, it's great to copy.
[00:46:29] Jordi Hays: It's great to get heavily inspired, but do it not for the category and the industry that
[00:46:34] Jordi Hays: you're competing in with the original person, right?
[00:46:37] Jordi Hays: Or not even competing with mind share, right?
[00:46:39] Jordi Hays: So the second company to do after the browser company to do the blank company and like a
[00:46:43] Jordi Hays: cursor, a cursive font, they probably got a little bit of attention because it was still
[00:46:49] Jordi Hays: somewhat novel.
[00:46:50] Jordi Hays: But now we're seeing like the fifth and sixth and seventh way, wave of, of naming companies
[00:46:55] Jordi Hays: in this way.
[00:46:56] Jordi Hays: And it's like the biggest anti-signal to me, right?
[00:46:58] Jordi Hays: It says like you are not an original thinker and maybe you just didn't want to take the
[00:47:02] Jordi Hays: time to like find a unique domain name.
[00:47:05] Jordi Hays: But even, even that says like you're not, you're not like heavily inspired.
[00:47:09] Jordi Hays: And so what, what TvPn has done is always borrowed from outside the industry, right?
[00:47:16] Jordi Hays: So like we borrowed suits, right?
[00:47:18] Jordi Hays: We borrowed, we borrowed, uh, mahogany, right?
[00:47:22] Jordi Hays: The official would of business, right?
[00:47:24] Jordi Hays: That was not a, it wasn't a wood that, uh, uh, well, that's, that's, uh,
[00:47:28] Jordi Hays: I just called it.
[00:47:29] Jordi Hays: Um, but, uh, but, uh, yeah, we, yeah, so, so, yeah, even some sales cultures, but certainly
[00:47:34] John Coogan: not like a common tech totem.
[00:47:37] John Coogan: Yeah.
[00:47:38] Jordi Hays: And then if you look at the show, the, the New York Times on Sunday, called us like
[00:47:42] Jordi Hays: LinkedIn or sports center for LinkedIn, yeah, yeah, which is hilarious because, yeah,
[00:47:46] Jordi Hays: it's, it's probably a great way to explain it to somebody that reads the New York Times.
[00:47:51] Jordi Hays: But we've never, I've, I've maybe watched an hour of sports center in my entire life
[00:47:55] Jordi Hays: across 29 years, right?
[00:47:58] Jordi Hays: An hour of sports center.
[00:47:59] Jordi Hays: So that wasn't even the inspiration, even though aesthetically we drew some inspiration
[00:48:04] Jordi Hays: if you look at our graphics packages and things like that.
[00:48:06] Jordi Hays: Uh, and then, and then from, from an advertising standpoint, like, I told every advertiser
[00:48:12] Jordi Hays: earlier that we were building a Formula One team, right?
[00:48:15] Jordi Hays: And that, uh, we weren't just going to give you a host red ad here or there.
[00:48:19] Jordi Hays: We were going to bring you into the entire world that we were building, right?
[00:48:24] Jordi Hays: And so we're constantly borrowing, but we're trying not to borrow.
[00:48:28] Jordi Hays: Uh, we even had, we were working on something, uh, we, we had a, uh, an entire product drop
[00:48:34] Jordi Hays: that we were going to do.
[00:48:35] Jordi Hays: We were going to send TBPN like way protein to like a thousand companies that are our,
[00:48:41] Jordi Hays: you know, friends, friends and friends at the show and things like that.
[00:48:44] Jordi Hays: And another company did like a supplement drop before and we just dropped it because we
[00:48:48] Jordi Hays: were like, we had done all the work to, to do it.
[00:48:50] Jordi Hays: We just, we hadn't hit go on the P.O. and we just said like, it's no longer going to
[00:48:55] Jordi Hays: be that interesting.
[00:48:56] Jordi Hays: And we don't want to fast follow within the same, within our same kind of like world, right?
[00:49:01] Jordi Hays: And so I think that's my biggest critique of tech is like, there's the, a really big world
[00:49:05] Jordi Hays: and you can go and borrow from anywhere.
[00:49:08] You guys do a really good job of being sort of like insider outsiders.
[00:49:11] Jackson Dahl: Um, both maybe personally also like, we're here in Hollywood.
[00:49:15] Jackson Dahl: We're not in Silicon Valley.
[00:49:15] Jackson Dahl: Like, that, it's one thing to say, like, have diverse inputs.
[00:49:19] Jackson Dahl: I'm curious how for both of you that has actually, how that like, is that a super intentional
[00:49:25] Jackson Dahl: thing?
[00:49:26] Jackson Dahl: Is that just kind of your natural curiosity?
[00:49:29] I think it's very clear that if you look for inputs on how to make a TV show look good
[00:49:37] John Coogan: in Silicon Valley, you're not going to find a bunch of great examples.
[00:49:41] John Coogan: And so it's much better to just go where they make great stuff and pull from that.
[00:49:48] John Coogan: And so, Holly was dying, man.
[00:49:50] John Coogan: Like, I don't mean, I don't have any good ideas.
[00:49:52] Jackson Dahl: I don't mean Holly would specifically, I totally, so I think, Holly would doesn't have
[00:49:56] Jordi Hays: maybe a ton of amazing new ideas, the beautiful thing.
[00:50:00] Jordi Hays: We come up with ideas all the time of like, okay, you take that show, that format, no one's
[00:50:05] Jordi Hays: done that in tech.
[00:50:06] Jordi Hays: If you do that, it will be a hit.
[00:50:08] Jordi Hays: And if you do it well, it'll be a hit.
[00:50:09] Jordi Hays: And we're even new to, it will be new to me.
[00:50:11] Jordi Hays: People will be like, wow, they're geniuses.
[00:50:13] Jordi Hays: Yes.
[00:50:14] Jordi Hays: I mean, when, when we were thinking about like, how do we want the, how do we want the
[00:50:18] John Coogan: look of the show to feel?
[00:50:20] John Coogan: We didn't just look at Pad McAfee and Sports Center and CNBC.
[00:50:24] John Coogan: We also, I also looked at like, like how new shows have been filmed throughout history.
[00:50:30] John Coogan: Like, what in the 1980s, if there was a movie about a new show or it featured a cut to,
[00:50:36] John Coogan: you know, let's go to the new show, what does that look like?
[00:50:39] John Coogan: What's that, it's that.
[00:50:40] John Coogan: How does Holly would portray a new studio when they have cinema gear and they can do proper
[00:50:46] John Coogan: lighting?
[00:50:47] Jackson Dahl: They have something in their head when they think of that.
[00:50:48] Jackson Dahl: Yeah.
[00:50:49] Jackson Dahl: And that's partially a product, the cultural time or whatever.
[00:50:51] Jackson Dahl: Yeah, that's really cool.
[00:50:52] Jackson Dahl: Yeah, yeah, there's a, there's an Apple TV show called The Morning Show.
[00:50:55] John Coogan: There's a whole variety.
[00:50:58] John Coogan: Aaron Sorkin has a show about the news as well.
[00:51:01] John Coogan: And there's been a bunch of places where we pulled like visual references.
[00:51:04] John Coogan: I mean, even right now, like this set design is much more moody and contrasty than pretty
[00:51:11] John Coogan: much any TV show, Pat McAfee, CNBC, Fox News, ABC, like all of those are much brighter
[00:51:19] John Coogan: sets.
[00:51:20] John Coogan: Well ours has a lot more contrast, a lot more, like it has a lot more cinema in there.
[00:51:24] John Coogan: We're even filming on cinema cameras instead of TV cameras.
[00:51:27] John Coogan: Like that's a deliberate choice.
[00:51:29] John Coogan: And like I wouldn't even know to find that, I wouldn't find that reference in text specifically.
[00:51:35] John Coogan: Yeah, I would say we, we have maybe found one idea with
[00:51:40] Jordi Hays: a certain tech to make the show better this year and we found hundreds from outside of tech.
[00:51:45] Jordi Hays: And so whenever I'm watching or consuming any type of media that's non-tech media, I'm
[00:51:53] Jordi Hays: like pausing, screen-shouting it, sending it to John, sending it to Ben, saying, hey, look
[00:51:58] Jordi Hays: at this, this is cool.
[00:51:59] Jordi Hays: We should, we should implement this kind of thing.
[00:52:02] Jordi Hays: And that just doesn't, and again, like tech is just kind of very circular.
[00:52:06] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[00:52:07] Jordi Hays: So this other VC podcast did this thing.
[00:52:10] Jordi Hays: We should do that.
[00:52:11] Jordi Hays: There's no, like, other industries are like, fashion is a great example of an industry that's
[00:52:16] Jackson Dahl: really good at this.
[00:52:17] Jackson Dahl: They're constantly looking elsewhere.
[00:52:19] Jackson Dahl: There's something.
[00:52:20] Jackson Dahl: No, it's the best.
[00:52:21] Jordi Hays: It's best example of that.
[00:52:22] Jordi Hays: They'll, they'll, they'll, a fashion brand for, that is planning their, their fall, winter,
[00:52:28] Jordi Hays: 2026 season now is going into the archive of another brand or they're finding like
[00:52:35] Jordi Hays: some ad campaign from Coca-Cola.
[00:52:37] Jordi Hays: And they're like, look at this.
[00:52:39] Jordi Hays: Like, this is amazing.
[00:52:40] Jordi Hays: Let's bring that into the present.
[00:52:42] John Coogan: This is true in other, like, Silicon Valley companies.
[00:52:46] John Coogan: We were just looking at Andrew O'Lunch to new augmented reality headset.
[00:52:50] John Coogan: It's like, that's not pulling from what Boeing is doing.
[00:52:53] John Coogan: They pulled it.
[00:52:54] John Coogan: It's from Call of Duty.
[00:52:55] John Coogan: They pulled from Call of Duty and pulled from like, anime.
[00:52:58] John Coogan: It also pulled from tech, which is not defense, which is the industry that actually, like,
[00:53:03] John Coogan: we're not a tech company, really, we're media company.
[00:53:06] John Coogan: They're really a defense company, but they're a tech defense company.
[00:53:10] John Coogan: And so, like, they're clearly pulling from other references.
[00:53:13] John Coogan: They're not just going to what is Lockheed Do, what is, what is Boeing Do.
[00:53:17] John Coogan: And that's always the nature of these things.
[00:53:20] On some level, you are making a show about the culture of tech, though.
[00:53:25] Jackson Dahl: One, I think, thing that you've done a good job of so far is sort of like playing to
[00:53:30] Jackson Dahl: a certain niche and playing enough inside base, stuff like the meta list is a great example.
[00:53:35] Jackson Dahl: The most inside baseball, it's like AI researcher, Twitter.
[00:53:39] Jackson Dahl: Of course, there are parts of tech, like Apple and Instagram, that are way more broadly
[00:53:41] Jackson Dahl: appealing.
[00:53:44] Jackson Dahl: Both now and in the future, I'm curious how you think about towing that line.
[00:53:47] Jackson Dahl: I think it seems clear you are making a show for people interested in tech, the business
[00:53:50] Jackson Dahl: side of the tech world, but how do you think about dialing the aperture wider or more narrow?
[00:53:57] We're not going wider.
[00:53:59] Jordi Hays: I agree.
[00:54:01] It's so critical because we have no plans to retire from the mics until we're just done.
[00:54:09] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[00:54:10] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[00:54:11] Jordi Hays: Actually retired.
[00:54:12] Jordi Hays: It's so critical that the content that we put out every day, the things that we talk about
[00:54:16] Jordi Hays: are deeply interesting to us.
[00:54:19] Jordi Hays: And there's a lot of tech content that, you know, if you look on YouTube and you just
[00:54:25] Jordi Hays: look for tech content, you're going to see like iPhone reviews, SpaceX news from
[00:54:29] Jordi Hays: 2 years ago, you know, some political critique of tech.
[00:54:34] John Coogan: That's really popular.
[00:54:35] John Coogan: So, we're trading.
[00:54:37] Jordi Hays: We have retail trading.
[00:54:38] Jordi Hays: We have retail trading.
[00:54:39] John Coogan: They're whole creators that are tech creators, but they would never talk about a private
[00:54:44] John Coogan: company because their audience is like, I don't care.
[00:54:47] John Coogan: Yes.
[00:54:48] John Coogan: We're almost the opposite.
[00:54:49] John Coogan: Or like, yeah, once they go out and they're mature, like, we'll talk to about them
[00:54:52] John Coogan: a little bit, but it's more about the lessons from when you guys might not care about
[00:54:55] John Coogan: that.
[00:54:56] John Coogan: Exactly.
[00:54:57] John Coogan: Yeah, and the thing that we said about private markets guys.
[00:54:59] Jordi Hays: The thing that we said early on, and I think it's still true, it's like we make content
[00:55:04] Jordi Hays: for 200,000 people in the world.
[00:55:07] Jordi Hays: People that run companies that invest, that work at the most important tech companies in
[00:55:12] Jordi Hays: the world that are, you know, it's the founder that just applied it and got into YC, right?
[00:55:17] Jordi Hays: It's like, it's a very small group of people and we're okay to make, just, we're very intentional
[00:55:22] Jordi Hays: about making sure that the content is interesting to them.
[00:55:25] Jordi Hays: We're not always going to get it right, but in general, if it's interesting to us, it's
[00:55:29] Jordi Hays: probably interesting to that group.
[00:55:31] Jordi Hays: What we've seen, the funny thing is we got a review, I think, last week or something
[00:55:37] Jordi Hays: in somebody said, like, I'm a dentist on the East, or I'm a doctor on the East Coast.
[00:55:43] Jordi Hays: I've never worked in technology.
[00:55:44] Jordi Hays: I started listening to TVPN and I'd listen every single day.
[00:55:48] Jordi Hays: And I think it's great if those kind of people adopt the show and enjoy it and get value
[00:55:57] Jordi Hays: out of it and use it to understand the world.
[00:56:01] Jordi Hays: But we would never adjust the content to try to get more of those type of people, right?
[00:56:07] Jordi Hays: And that would be like doing tech reviews, right?
[00:56:09] Jordi Hays: And anymore shallow.
[00:56:10] Jordi Hays: And yeah, or just being like, what's the next 100x stock?
[00:56:13] Jordi Hays: We could 100x every single view, impression, subscriber number in three months if we wanted
[00:56:21] John Coogan: to.
[00:56:22] John Coogan: Like, I've done it before.
[00:56:23] John Coogan: I got to half a million subscribers on YouTube.
[00:56:26] John Coogan: My biggest videos were like, the history of Donald Trump, the history of Xi Jinping.
[00:56:29] John Coogan: Like, you know, you just stop making the story.
[00:56:32] John Coogan: Yeah, so history and politics are the two things that would.
[00:56:35] Jordi Hays: It's so easy if you're just chasing views.
[00:56:38] John Coogan: But that's not what we're doing here because we're actually building it as a business,
[00:56:42] John Coogan: not just as like some sort of vanity.
[00:56:44] John Coogan: Yeah, the business part almost makes it.
[00:56:45] Jackson Dahl: It's almost a constraint that's helpful.
[00:56:47] Jackson Dahl: Totally, totally.
[00:56:48] John Coogan: Because as soon as you go there, you're just selling different products.
[00:56:50] John Coogan: CPMs are different.
[00:56:51] John Coogan: There's a whole bunch of things.
[00:56:52] John Coogan: And I don't think we did enjoy it as much.
[00:56:54] John Coogan: And then it's way more competitive because there's so many great shows about politics or
[00:56:58] John Coogan: what's going on in the public markets.
[00:56:59] John Coogan: I mean, you look at like what's CNBC and Bloomberg like that.
[00:57:02] John Coogan: Those are actually great products if you're retail traders.
[00:57:04] John Coogan: Yeah.
[00:57:05] John Coogan: And you actually want to look at the stock chart for the debt.
[00:57:07] John Coogan: But we're rarely pulling up stock charts because a lot of times you're talking about
[00:57:10] John Coogan: private companies.
[00:57:11] John Coogan: Right.
[00:57:12] Jordi Hays: Yeah, and I thought I think another thing that's notable is a lot of traditional business
[00:57:15] Jordi Hays: television.
[00:57:17] Jordi Hays: The formats and the structure of the shows were created at a time when people didn't
[00:57:22] Jordi Hays: have a cell phone in their pocket.
[00:57:24] Jordi Hays: So it was like deeply valuable to have a screen that was just like flashing charts of what
[00:57:28] Jordi Hays: is gold doing?
[00:57:29] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[00:57:30] Jordi Hays: Yeah, what is gold doing?
[00:57:31] Jordi Hays: What is this stock doing?
[00:57:32] Jordi Hays: You know, the S&P is down 1%.
[00:57:35] Jordi Hays: Like that was really valuable.
[00:57:36] Jordi Hays: You could have it on because you didn't have like a phone that would give you exactly what
[00:57:41] Jordi Hays: you're.
[00:57:42] Jordi Hays: So and so our coverage is something we've a challenge has been not being too inspired
[00:57:50] Jordi Hays: by television.
[00:57:51] Jordi Hays: Right.
[00:57:52] Jordi Hays: People want to put a label on it and say like, oh, it's like a new CNBC or something
[00:57:58] Jordi Hays: that.
[00:57:59] Jordi Hays: But it's important to not not.
[00:58:01] Jordi Hays: It's important to be inspired but create some constraint.
[00:58:03] Jordi Hays: What was it?
[00:58:04] John Coogan: The New York Times used to have box scores for every game that would be played in sports
[00:58:10] John Coogan: and because you just couldn't look them up.
[00:58:12] John Coogan: And the Wall Street Journal to this day has several pages printed in there of the share
[00:58:18] John Coogan: price of the top 1000 companies in the world.
[00:58:21] John Coogan: You know, that's obviously valuable to the folks that didn't evolve.
[00:58:26] John Coogan: There was just the way it was done.
[00:58:28] John Coogan: The only reason it's still doing is the way it's been done.
[00:58:30] John Coogan: Exactly.
[00:58:31] John Coogan: So do we want a segment of the show where we just read off every stock price?
[00:58:36] John Coogan: Like, I don't think so.
[00:58:37] John Coogan: Name every stock, John.
[00:58:39] Jordi Hays: I actually there actually was a streamer who was doing that for a while and it was actually
[00:58:42] John Coogan: pretty effective because people found it very like meditated.
[00:58:44] John Coogan: Like it is.
[00:58:45] John Coogan: So actually, I don't want to count that out as like a bad thing.
[00:58:50] John Coogan: But yeah, I mean, in general, like we want to do a show that assumes the modern trappings
[00:58:57] John Coogan: of technology and modernity.
[00:58:59] John Coogan: Yeah, we're also, you said, are you news?
[00:59:01] Jordi Hays: It's a good question.
[00:59:02] Jordi Hays: I would say we are not the delivery mechanism for news.
[00:59:09] Jordi Hays: Yes.
[00:59:10] Jordi Hays: We're like the conversational layer that happens on top of it because oftentimes I find out
[00:59:13] Jordi Hays: news from the chat right here.
[00:59:15] Jordi Hays: Somebody says like, all caps, they'll just put it in the chat and I go to X and I'm like,
[00:59:19] Jordi Hays: oh yeah, this broke five minutes ago, whatever.
[00:59:20] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[00:59:21] Jordi Hays: So how's that group chat now where they send posts from X to the group chat?
[00:59:27] John Coogan: And they're hoping that there's a little bit of discussion around it and we just kind
[00:59:30] John Coogan: of like, productize that.
[00:59:31] John Coogan: Yes.
[00:59:32] John Coogan: Yes.
[00:59:33] John Coogan: Yeah, we'll talk about it.
[00:59:34] John Coogan: We'll give you a couple of sound bites on either side of whatever tweet is going viral
[00:59:39] John Coogan: right now that, you know, maybe there's a little bit in the quote tweets and the DMs
[00:59:42] John Coogan: and whatnot, but we're just an actual air on top of that.
[00:59:44] John Coogan: Let's talk about that a little bit.
[00:59:46] Jackson Dahl: I think this story, there's a lot of things that went into this success you guys have had
[00:59:51] Jackson Dahl: in the last year, but I think maybe more than anything else, aside from your own ability,
[00:59:56] Jackson Dahl: is thinking sort of medium first around X or Twitter.
[01:00:00] Jackson Dahl: The first viral stuff was you log on, you had a viral tweet and you see two guys in a
[01:00:04] Jackson Dahl: suit reading your tweet on a printed piece of paper.
[01:00:07] Jackson Dahl: A amazing line from you this morning, you said, X is the internet's dive bar.
[01:00:12] Jackson Dahl: The drinks have always been cheap.
[01:00:13] Jackson Dahl: The bathroom faucet perpetually broken.
[01:00:15] Jackson Dahl: The whole place has changed ownership multiple times.
[01:00:18] Jackson Dahl: Ultimately, it's where groups of friends go to hang out regularly in that aspect compensates
[01:00:22] Jackson Dahl: for its rough edges, but you can't act surprised when a fight breaks out.
[01:00:27] And in many ways, like, I was like half me, half the work shopping.
[01:00:32] Jackson Dahl: In many ways, like, I think, I don't know, I've been meeting people on Twitter for the
[01:00:35] Jackson Dahl: last decade and I've always struggled to explain to people.
[01:00:37] Jackson Dahl: There is this sort of unique thing for maybe it's 200,000 people.
[01:00:40] Jackson Dahl: I don't know exactly how big, but there's a few.
[01:00:41] Jackson Dahl: I don't think there's that many people.
[01:00:42] Jackson Dahl: No, no, no.
[01:00:43] Jackson Dahl: If you're in true tech Twitter and you make a banger about, like, Josh Kushner, for example,
[01:00:49] John Coogan: the pure inside, no one outside really knows yet, like, a thousand likes or a couple thousand
[01:00:57] John Coogan: likes is like, yeah, I did it.
[01:00:59] John Coogan: I have a few on the list.
[01:01:00] Jackson Dahl: You got it.
[01:01:01] Jackson Dahl: You can go hang out with people the next day and say, start reference, like, you can
[01:01:05] Jackson Dahl: basically reference the tweet, not really that specific thing.
[01:01:08] Jackson Dahl: Oh, I saw that.
[01:01:09] John Coogan: Oh, I saw that.
[01:01:10] John Coogan: Exactly.
[01:01:11] John Coogan: It's a small table at the dive bar.
[01:01:13] John Coogan: At the dive bar.
[01:01:14] Jackson Dahl: Exactly.
[01:01:15] Jackson Dahl: What?
[01:01:16] Jackson Dahl: Maybe you've already talked about it a little bit.
[01:01:17] Jackson Dahl: Yeah, I'm curious what you love about that medium and maybe more importantly, how over the
[01:01:20] Jackson Dahl: course of the last year, you guys have evolved with it as kind of the main kind of playing
[01:01:24] Jackson Dahl: field.
[01:01:25] Jordi Hays: So I think that people mistake, they want to pin our success on growth hacks.
[01:01:31] Jordi Hays: Right.
[01:01:32] Jordi Hays: So, like, clipping was a growth hack.
[01:01:34] Jordi Hays: Virality.
[01:01:35] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[01:01:37] There are people out there that believe we have had success because we figured out a
[01:01:44] Jordi Hays: good growth strategy.
[01:01:46] Jordi Hays: And that is certainly contributed to the success.
[01:01:48] Jordi Hays: But the, that is not like why we are successful.
[01:01:52] Jordi Hays: And so I think we're constantly thinking about growth levers and new ways to distribute
[01:02:00] Jordi Hays: the content.
[01:02:01] Jordi Hays: But fundamentally, the thing that we actually care about is the show.
[01:02:04] Jordi Hays: And like every single day, making it slightly, slightly better.
[01:02:07] Jordi Hays: I think like it is accurate to say that TBPN is a media company or it's a show that was
[01:02:13] Jordi Hays: born on X and that is an entertainment is like a companion product to X.
[01:02:21] Jordi Hays: But it's not any specific strategy.
[01:02:24] Jordi Hays: I think one of the way that the thing that I think is really powerful is I know personally
[01:02:29] Jordi Hays: I would use podcasts to understand current events.
[01:02:33] Jordi Hays: But it's like wildly, it's like a wildly inefficient way to do it because you're like,
[01:02:37] Jordi Hays: okay, I found this podcast that was recorded three weeks ago.
[01:02:41] Jordi Hays: They're going to talk about one of these things.
[01:02:42] Jordi Hays: And it was published a week ago and they talked about this thing that I'm reading about
[01:02:47] Jordi Hays: now, but now the set of events has changed.
[01:02:50] Jordi Hays: And so there wasn't like a bleeding edge.
[01:02:53] Jordi Hays: There were like TBPN at its core is like a bleeding edge commentary on the, you know, we
[01:03:00] Jordi Hays: went off there at 2PM Pacific today.
[01:03:02] Jordi Hays: We won't be back on until 11 tomorrow.
[01:03:04] Jordi Hays: There's going to be some stuff that happens in between there.
[01:03:07] Jordi Hays: But in general, it's like always present, right?
[01:03:09] Jordi Hays: You're reacting two tweets that have been tweeted while you've been live.
[01:03:13] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[01:03:14] And so I think that much more than a specific growth hack or flipping or things like that
[01:03:20] Jordi Hays: or a specific thing we did with the brand or the suits or anything like that is why it's
[01:03:26] Jordi Hays: like, was a unique media product and got traction, right?
[01:03:30] Jordi Hays: Because people see the clips.
[01:03:32] Jordi Hays: They don't see the tens of thousands of people that are tuning in daily to the show, right?
[01:03:38] Jordi Hays: That happens below the surface.
[01:03:40] Jordi Hays: And so I think people have tried to kind of overanalyze the, of course tech people are
[01:03:46] Jordi Hays: think like, okay, TBPN is like, they're like, they realize that like clipping is the
[01:03:52] Jordi Hays: only thing that matters.
[01:03:53] Jordi Hays: Yeah, you took that medium seriously.
[01:03:56] Jackson Dahl: There's no gotchas.
[01:03:57] Jackson Dahl: That's my point is that maybe for the first time, a truly ex native media thing.
[01:04:06] And that was a really powerful thing.
[01:04:07] Jackson Dahl: I do love growth hacks.
[01:04:09] John Coogan: It's really fun to figure out what works in the current ex algorithm.
[01:04:13] John Coogan: It's constantly changing.
[01:04:14] John Coogan: I think we knew we had this idea of like, you know, sort of polygrams do things that don't
[01:04:21] John Coogan: scale, but also just this idea of like, love letters to Silicon Valley.
[01:04:25] John Coogan: So when you think about you post a tweet, maybe it gets a thousand likes, but at a certain
[01:04:30] John Coogan: point, your phone just kind of like explodes and it just kind of abstracts and just like
[01:04:35] John Coogan: over.
[01:04:36] John Coogan: You're refreshing.
[01:04:37] John Coogan: It's like another 500 random people liked it.
[01:04:39] John Coogan: Like, it's exciting, but it gets old if you post a lot.
[01:04:42] And you lose the connection of like, and sometimes you can see, okay, this person that I am,
[01:04:48] John Coogan: I'm actually friends with in real life like that.
[01:04:50] John Coogan: That's exciting.
[01:04:51] John Coogan: But the number getting bigger and bigger like that gets old really fast.
[01:04:56] John Coogan: And you can reply and you can quote tweet, but quote tweeting with a video, it's like a
[01:05:01] John Coogan: sore pay of us in suits with Europe tweet printed was just like the super quote tweet.
[01:05:07] John Coogan: It was the, it was the highest honor that you could do.
[01:05:10] John Coogan: And the, it was just like, this post is so important.
[01:05:13] John Coogan: Now it's the score cards, the player cards or the wedding announcement on the, exactly,
[01:05:18] Jackson Dahl: yeah, yeah.
[01:05:19] John Coogan: And so finding like that player card format has been used in all sorts of Instagram accounts
[01:05:25] John Coogan: for certain like box scores for sports events and complex does it.
[01:05:31] John Coogan: There's a lot of folks that use that kind of format, but bringing that to X again was
[01:05:34] John Coogan: another kind of interesting like growth hack.
[01:05:37] John Coogan: There's been a whole bunch of those that are fun to, fun to innovate on, but I think
[01:05:40] John Coogan: we've never lost sight of the fact that just like content wants to be free and so advertising
[01:05:47] John Coogan: is a natural fit.
[01:05:49] Content also wants to be everywhere.
[01:05:51] John Coogan: But that doesn't necessarily just mean take the same thing and put it on every platform.
[01:05:55] John Coogan: Every platform is unique.
[01:05:56] John Coogan: And so from a very early stage, we were on RSS everywhere on YouTube also and a lot of
[01:06:03] John Coogan: podcasts, they were audio only and then they realized like, okay, we need to do video
[01:06:09] John Coogan: at some point.
[01:06:10] John Coogan: So they added a video component, but it's just them sitting in like they're like kind of
[01:06:13] John Coogan: bland like, you know, a little corner of the office with some slap walls and stuff.
[01:06:17] John Coogan: It's not opinionated.
[01:06:19] John Coogan: And so we said like, well, for YouTube, like you really want to do is build a set that's
[01:06:22] John Coogan: like opinionated for your video.
[01:06:23] John Coogan: You guys have built a world here.
[01:06:25] John Coogan: A world, there's a world here exactly.
[01:06:27] John Coogan: And so like you can think about this world, this world does not matter visual, the visual
[01:06:32] John Coogan: world does not matter for the RSS product.
[01:06:35] John Coogan: But the RSS product does need us to contextualize things that we're looking at.
[01:06:39] John Coogan: And so as we're doing the show, we will be describing what we see.
[01:06:44] John Coogan: That's us thinking for the RSS feed.
[01:06:45] John Coogan: Then this set design is us thinking for the YouTube channel.
[01:06:48] John Coogan: Then how we clip on X and what context we give you, the subtitles, all of that is thinking
[01:06:53] John Coogan: for X on Instagram, vertical.
[01:06:56] John Coogan: It needs to be a little bit tighter, one to three minutes.
[01:06:59] John Coogan: That's a different format.
[01:07:00] John Coogan: So like the medium is the message.
[01:07:03] John Coogan: The medium is really important on all these different platforms and kind of thinking about
[01:07:07] you create all this content.
[01:07:08] John Coogan: How do you actually make it feel native in that platform?
[01:07:12] John Coogan: And each platform is basically a full-time job.
[01:07:15] Jordi Hays: Companies still have this mindset of like, I'm going to hire a person to do social.
[01:07:20] Jordi Hays: And I don't believe that, you know, ask anyone on X that's like growing an account on X
[01:07:26] Jordi Hays: really quickly, how they're doing on Instagram, if they're not maybe a full-time content creator.
[01:07:33] Jordi Hays: And you know, every one of these platforms is different.
[01:07:35] Jordi Hays: And so we've been, takes a long time to like start, you know, chopping them down.
[01:07:40] Jordi Hays: What makes, I do want to talk a little bit about other platforms, but you guys long before
[01:07:45] Jackson Dahl: this were pretty good at Twitter.
[01:07:47] Jackson Dahl: Or at X.
[01:07:48] Jackson Dahl: Sorry.
[01:07:49] Jackson Dahl: That's all habits.
[01:07:51] Jackson Dahl: What makes somebody good at that platform?
[01:07:53] Yeah.
[01:07:54] I mean, just thinking about your question about taking, taking X, taking Twitter seriously,
[01:08:01] John Coogan: I think that to close that part out, it really was just that like the 200,000 most important
[01:08:06] John Coogan: people in tech and business and the private markets, that's where they hang out, that's
[01:08:10] John Coogan: their Bloomberg chat, that's the Bloomberg terminal.
[01:08:12] John Coogan: And so it doesn't matter how senior you get at the most tier one fund, everyone's going
[01:08:18] John Coogan: to Twitter.
[01:08:19] John Coogan: Like they, and if something's happening on Twitter, they're talking about it in a group chat,
[01:08:22] John Coogan: they might not post.
[01:08:23] John Coogan: They might be.
[01:08:24] John Coogan: I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love,
[01:08:27] Jordi Hays: I'm like a multi-stage, like VC that, like it doesn't use to, I literally go on Twitter,
[01:08:33] Jordi Hays: and then, and then you tweet something with their name, not even tagging them, and they
[01:08:37] John Coogan: text you within five seconds, and you're like, okay, so you're extremely online, that,
[01:08:42] John Coogan: yeah, that definitely happens, but, yeah, so so I just, I just think in general, it's like,
[01:08:46] John Coogan: it's like the, the, the 200,000 most valuable, most important people in tech are there, advertising
[01:08:51] John Coogan: them, obviously, important so you want to go there first, you want to nail that, and
[01:08:54] John Coogan: then kind of flow through from that, in terms of what it takes to, you know, other
[01:08:56] John Coogan: what it takes to be good at Twitter,
[01:08:58] John Coogan: there's a whole bunch of things,
[01:09:00] John Coogan: but the distillation that I heard that was the most
[01:09:05] John Coogan: of synth was from Dwarke Hesh Patali said,
[01:09:08] John Coogan: tweet like you're lobbying texts in a group chat.
[01:09:12] John Coogan: And don't actually think about trying to open a doc
[01:09:14] John Coogan: and turn it into a post or like a blog post.
[01:09:18] John Coogan: Actually just think like, oh, I would text this
[01:09:20] John Coogan: to a couple of friends.
[01:09:21] John Coogan: It's like I'm texting to a couple of friends
[01:09:23] John Coogan: and that does well.
[01:09:24] John Coogan: Do you have any other insights?
[01:09:26] I think every poster is great for a different reason.
[01:09:30] Jordi Hays: You know, I've seen people try to adopt
[01:09:35] Jordi Hays: like the clueless style,
[01:09:37] Jordi Hays: like the royally style of posting
[01:09:40] Jordi Hays: and you could say, maybe there's people out there
[01:09:42] Jordi Hays: that don't like his style, but they still watch.
[01:09:46] Jordi Hays: Right.
[01:09:47] Jackson Dahl: So when he first got going, it was,
[01:09:49] Jackson Dahl: I don't know how much of it,
[01:09:50] Jackson Dahl: like was it good up to you?
[01:09:52] Jackson Dahl: It was different though to go back to your influences thing.
[01:09:55] Jackson Dahl: Yeah, the same thing.
[01:09:56] Jackson Dahl: Like he is definitely doing something different.
[01:09:58] Jackson Dahl: You can hate it, but it is not the same style
[01:10:01] Jackson Dahl: that everybody else is trying.
[01:10:02] Jackson Dahl: Yeah, I think the meta changes a lot.
[01:10:07] John Coogan: Sometimes it's memes are really pithy,
[01:10:11] John Coogan: kind of one-liners.
[01:10:13] John Coogan: The long posts seem to be doing really well recently.
[01:10:16] John Coogan: I've noticed that.
[01:10:17] John Coogan: As the algorithm changes one day,
[01:10:18] John Coogan: I'll just open it and be like,
[01:10:19] John Coogan: oh, I'm getting like every post that is served to me
[01:10:22] John Coogan: is basically like an essay by,
[01:10:24] John Coogan: yeah, yeah.
[01:10:25] John Coogan: Tecologists.
[01:10:26] John Coogan: Yeah, yeah, there's basically an essay by a technologist
[01:10:28] John Coogan: about something that's pretty deep.
[01:10:30] John Coogan: And then sometimes you'll just get sloped up with,
[01:10:33] John Coogan: you know, this is the same thing you see too.
[01:10:35] Jordi Hays: There's counts out there that are getting 10 million
[01:10:38] Jordi Hays: impressions a month that are basically worthless accounts.
[01:10:42] Jordi Hays: Like they could not sell 100 copies of a book if they wrote it.
[01:10:46] Jordi Hays: And then there's accounts out there that have 600 followers
[01:10:49] Jordi Hays: that are getting 300,000 impressions a month.
[01:10:53] Jordi Hays: And they could raise like a $30 million seed rent.
[01:10:55] Jordi Hays: And so it's the same thing of understanding.
[01:10:59] Jordi Hays: Yeah, just understanding the quality of the content.
[01:11:02] Jordi Hays: It's who's actually watching or who's actually engaging
[01:11:06] Jordi Hays: with the content, who gets value.
[01:11:08] Jordi Hays: And that can be inversely correlated with size.
[01:11:11] Jordi Hays: I mean, with all these platforms,
[01:11:13] John Coogan: there is something valuable about volume.
[01:11:16] John Coogan: You see this with a lot of accounts that post a lot of viral stuff.
[01:11:20] John Coogan: If you actually click on the account,
[01:11:21] John Coogan: it's like, oh, well, they had 10 flops on the path.
[01:11:23] John Coogan: That's a really big one.
[01:11:26] John Coogan: And so there's a little bit of like,
[01:11:28] John Coogan: if you're posting a lot, you build the muscle.
[01:11:30] John Coogan: And that's just true for you.
[01:11:31] John Coogan: I still think it's the most efficient way
[01:11:33] Jordi Hays: to become known in tech to like breakthrough.
[01:11:37] Jordi Hays: That's the town square.
[01:11:38] Jordi Hays: Like, yeah, it's still like you can have somebody
[01:11:42] Jordi Hays: who is an outsider break into the industry
[01:11:45] Jordi Hays: just by the quality of their thoughts.
[01:11:49] John Coogan: On the other platforms, obviously, you're doing a lot
[01:11:53] Jackson Dahl: in a lot of places already.
[01:11:54] Jackson Dahl: I think the sub-stack stuff to your earlier point is great.
[01:11:56] Jackson Dahl: Who knows?
[01:11:57] Jackson Dahl: Maybe it's even your guys' cameos on Sora.
[01:11:59] Jackson Dahl: I'm curious how you think about that
[01:12:01] Jackson Dahl: and maybe what near-term priorities there are
[01:12:03] Jackson Dahl: within the context of what we were talking about earlier,
[01:12:05] Jackson Dahl: which is you're not going for people outside of that
[01:12:08] Jackson Dahl: 200,000 people.
[01:12:09] Jackson Dahl: So you can make the case that actually like,
[01:12:11] Jackson Dahl: Instagram doesn't matter.
[01:12:12] Jackson Dahl: No, Instagram does matter
[01:12:13] John Coogan: because the same 200,000 people are also on Instagram.
[01:12:17] John Coogan: And I want to hit them there.
[01:12:18] John Coogan: I want to hit them there.
[01:12:19] John Coogan: With different content.
[01:12:20] John Coogan: With different, yes, yes, yes.
[01:12:21] John Coogan: Same audience.
[01:12:22] John Coogan: Slightly different content.
[01:12:24] John Coogan: Because if you look at the Wall Street Journal,
[01:12:26] John Coogan: you open it up.
[01:12:27] John Coogan: There's the business section,
[01:12:28] John Coogan: but there's also the mansion section.
[01:12:30] John Coogan: And so what we're going to send,
[01:12:31] John Coogan: hopefully there's exact same people.
[01:12:33] John Coogan: We're going to send them on Instagram something
[01:12:34] John Coogan: that's a little bit more sugar.
[01:12:36] John Coogan: Yeah, it's going to be a little bit more.
[01:12:38] John Coogan: Yeah, whereas on X, you get like 400 words for me.
[01:12:42] John Coogan: It's like kind of a debate about a thing
[01:12:44] John Coogan: or some sort of technical deep dive we might be talking about
[01:12:47] John Coogan: or we might do an interview with some AI researcher one day.
[01:12:51] John Coogan: That's going to be a little bit less like Instagram focused.
[01:12:54] John Coogan: And I think people everywhere.
[01:12:56] John Coogan: I think there's a stated versus revealed preference
[01:13:00] Jordi Hays: phenomena happening as well,
[01:13:01] Jordi Hays: where you have people that say,
[01:13:05] Jordi Hays: like nobody wants to, like no like high powered executive
[01:13:09] Jordi Hays: wants to go out and say, I love Instagram.
[01:13:11] Jordi Hays: I use Instagram for like two hours a day.
[01:13:13] Jordi Hays: It's awesome.
[01:13:14] Jordi Hays: And on there, that's like my main thing.
[01:13:15] Jordi Hays: I just love Instagram.
[01:13:17] Jordi Hays: But let's be real.
[01:13:18] There's certainly a bunch of high powered CEOs out there
[01:13:21] Jordi Hays: that are using Instagram a lot, right?
[01:13:24] Jordi Hays: Maybe they're not your heroes,
[01:13:25] Jordi Hays: but they're people that are able to move markets.
[01:13:28] Jordi Hays: And so I learned that my wife started posting on TikTok in 2022.
[01:13:36] Jordi Hays: And the quality of just inbound people
[01:13:41] Jordi Hays: coming through LinkedIn was insane.
[01:13:43] Jordi Hays: Just from I saw your TikTok, like I'd love to talk with you.
[01:13:47] John Coogan: They would leave TikTok, go to LinkedIn.
[01:13:49] Jordi Hays: And like also for these people, Twitter doesn't exist.
[01:13:52] Jordi Hays: Sure, sure.
[01:13:53] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[01:13:54] John Coogan: Another thing about it, I got a lot of that from YouTube too.
[01:13:55] John Coogan: People would DM me on LinkedIn.
[01:13:57] John Coogan: Yeah, so part of it is yeah, understanding that X is this,
[01:14:01] Jordi Hays: like it's an ecosystem.
[01:14:03] Jordi Hays: It's like relatively small.
[01:14:05] Jordi Hays: And if you want to have an impact on the world,
[01:14:07] Jordi Hays: you have to break out of X, right?
[01:14:09] Jordi Hays: You have to break out.
[01:14:10] Jordi Hays: And everybody that has built a, you know, audience on X
[01:14:14] Jordi Hays: has experienced, you know, meeting somebody that uses X
[01:14:18] Jordi Hays: and they're like, oh, how's it going?
[01:14:19] Jordi Hays: It's great to see you.
[01:14:20] Jordi Hays: And then meeting somebody that's like,
[01:14:22] Jordi Hays: might be important, but they're on LinkedIn.
[01:14:24] Jordi Hays: And they're like, who are you?
[01:14:25] Jordi Hays: Like, what do you do?
[01:14:27] Jordi Hays: Oh, you have a manufacturing, like manufacturing company.
[01:14:30] Jordi Hays: That's cool.
[01:14:30] Jordi Hays: Like, you know, they don't have the context.
[01:14:32] Jordi Hays: Right.
[01:14:33] Jordi Hays: Right.
[01:14:35] There's a, I guess like a meta thing,
[01:14:37] Jackson Dahl: which is, I mentioned this a few times.
[01:14:40] Jackson Dahl: You guys are both amazing internet marketers.
[01:14:43] Jackson Dahl: Within this context and without it.
[01:14:46] I think my best version of trying to distill what that is
[01:14:49] Jackson Dahl: is making content or products
[01:14:52] Jackson Dahl: that other people want to share.
[01:14:55] Jackson Dahl: Or even more, they want to like share their reaction to
[01:15:00] Jackson Dahl: or them talking about.
[01:15:01] Jackson Dahl: Yeah.
[01:15:02] Jackson Dahl: Yeah.
[01:15:03] Jackson Dahl: I think it's much, I think it's much more,
[01:15:05] Jordi Hays: like the way that I think about it is everything you do
[01:15:08] Jordi Hays: from a marketing standpoint should entertain people,
[01:15:12] Jordi Hays: should inspire them or educate them.
[01:15:15] Jordi Hays: And then it's like, I don't know that many other buckets
[01:15:17] Jordi Hays: that stuff can fit into.
[01:15:19] Jordi Hays: All right.
[01:15:19] Jordi Hays: So we talk with companies all the time that are like,
[01:15:21] Jordi Hays: hey, I'm doing this, like I'm going to do this campaign.
[01:15:25] Jordi Hays: Or I'm going to work with this person.
[01:15:26] Jordi Hays: Or I'm going to do this stunt.
[01:15:28] Jordi Hays: And I can, like you sharpen your intuition enough
[01:15:33] Jordi Hays: and you understand like, okay, does this fit into the bucket
[01:15:36] Jordi Hays: of is it wildly entertaining?
[01:15:38] Jordi Hays: Is it wildly inspirational?
[01:15:41] Jordi Hays: Is it wildly informative?
[01:15:42] Jordi Hays: And is it actually bringing novel information to people?
[01:15:45] Jordi Hays: And for me, if it doesn't fit into those buckets,
[01:15:47] Jordi Hays: like it's just not going to hit.
[01:15:48] Jordi Hays: And you can have something hit in any of those buckets, right?
[01:15:51] Jordi Hays: You can, some of like for a poster, for example,
[01:15:54] Jordi Hays: can entertain, they can just post something that's like,
[01:15:57] Jordi Hays: super funny, perfect timing, and it can get, you know,
[01:16:00] Jordi Hays: a million views.
[01:16:01] Jordi Hays: You know, a video that like feels emotional and inspiring,
[01:16:04] Jordi Hays: right?
[01:16:05] Jordi Hays: The Founders Fund, the iconic Founders Fund, Vibrio.
[01:16:08] Jordi Hays: First Vibrio ever.
[01:16:09] Jordi Hays: Yeah, so that was before my time.
[01:16:12] John Coogan: Yeah, but that is an example of like novel kind of like format
[01:16:17] Jordi Hays: hadn't really been done in tech.
[01:16:19] Jordi Hays: But it was inspiring.
[01:16:20] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[01:16:21] Jordi Hays: And when we did.
[01:16:22] Jordi Hays: What's the stuff we do?
[01:16:23] Jordi Hays: I think even more narrowly around entertainment,
[01:16:27] John Coogan: I just think of funny.
[01:16:29] John Coogan: I think a lot of this stuff is just like, is it funny?
[01:16:31] John Coogan: And then people might share it, but I feel like we keep
[01:16:33] John Coogan: going back to humor is just like, like if we're laughing
[01:16:37] John Coogan: about the concept.
[01:16:38] John Coogan: And some simplicity, right?
[01:16:40] Jordi Hays: Like good, like virality hates complexity, right?
[01:16:46] Jordi Hays: Like if you launch a complex idea that requires a lot of context,
[01:16:49] Jordi Hays: yes, it will not go, it will not go viral.
[01:16:52] Jordi Hays: You can kind of people try to brute force it.
[01:16:54] Jordi Hays: They get the wrong, they get the kind of the wrong signal,
[01:16:57] Jordi Hays: right?
[01:16:58] Jordi Hays: Like somebody will launch something that is complicated
[01:17:00] Jordi Hays: and confusing, and they will get hundreds of people.
[01:17:03] Jordi Hays: Like they'll send the post to a bunch of people and be like,
[01:17:05] Jordi Hays: like this, please comment, repose, quote, quote it.
[01:17:08] Jordi Hays: And you can kind of like manufacture it,
[01:17:10] Jordi Hays: but you can actually see it in the data.
[01:17:12] Jordi Hays: You can be like, this is not getting any reach
[01:17:15] Jordi Hays: because people don't actually like it.
[01:17:17] Jordi Hays: And like the actual ratio of engagement is like bad.
[01:17:21] Jordi Hays: So it looks like it was a successful launch,
[01:17:24] Jordi Hays: but it was really just like engagement farming.
[01:17:26] Jackson Dahl: This is what Gabe and Mischief says,
[01:17:28] Jackson Dahl: he's like, we want ideas that slap in one sentence
[01:17:31] Jackson Dahl: and slap harder in three.
[01:17:32] Jackson Dahl: Yeah.
[01:17:33] Jackson Dahl: But make sure it slaps in one sentence.
[01:17:34] Jackson Dahl: And I think a lot of people on Twitter and in tech
[01:17:37] Jackson Dahl: that the tendency, including my own, is to like,
[01:17:40] Jackson Dahl: I'm trying to do a three order, like you need all this contact.
[01:17:43] Jackson Dahl: And it's like, no, actually starting simple
[01:17:46] Jackson Dahl: is a really, really strong way.
[01:17:47] Jackson Dahl: So when people pitch, when people pitch us marketing ideas,
[01:17:51] Jordi Hays: I tell them, I have more context on your business
[01:17:54] Jordi Hays: than 99.9% of people in the world.
[01:17:57] Jordi Hays: And I'm going to need you to repeat that marketing idea back
[01:18:00] Jordi Hays: to me because I'm still used.
[01:18:02] Jordi Hays: Yes.
[01:18:03] Jordi Hays: And if you hit the timeline with this,
[01:18:05] Jordi Hays: you're going to have a bunch of people that,
[01:18:07] like if their immediate reaction is like,
[01:18:09] Jordi Hays: wait, what's going on?
[01:18:10] Jordi Hays: And so they're certainly not entertained
[01:18:12] Jordi Hays: because being confused is not a great state to be in.
[01:18:15] Jordi Hays: They're certainly not inspired.
[01:18:16] Jordi Hays: They're not like, oh, I want to take action now,
[01:18:18] Jordi Hays: or I'm feeling an emotion.
[01:18:20] Jordi Hays: And then they're certainly not being educated
[01:18:21] Jordi Hays: because they're just sitting there of like,
[01:18:22] Jordi Hays: I just watched this video.
[01:18:23] Jordi Hays: And I don't, or I just watched 30 seconds
[01:18:25] Jordi Hays: of this 90 second video.
[01:18:27] Jordi Hays: And I don't know what's going on.
[01:18:28] Jordi Hays: And I'm onto the next thing, right?
[01:18:29] Jordi Hays: And so.
[01:18:30] Jordi Hays: Why do you think the original technology
[01:18:32] John Coogan: brothers launch video went viral?
[01:18:37] Because it was nobody in tech would do something as silly as that.
[01:18:44] Jordi Hays: It was funny.
[01:18:45] John Coogan: It was certainly entertaining.
[01:18:46] John Coogan: It didn't.
[01:18:47] John Coogan: It didn't.
[01:18:47] John Coogan: Well, I want to go back to the idea of like,
[01:18:49] John Coogan: make it shareable because we never thought about like,
[01:18:53] John Coogan: oh, there will be something in here
[01:18:54] John Coogan: that people have to share.
[01:18:55] John Coogan: But maybe we did in the sense that like, if you see this,
[01:18:58] John Coogan: you can just send it to your friend.
[01:18:59] John Coogan: Oh, yeah.
[01:19:00] John Coogan: If you look back at what the criticism of that video was,
[01:19:03] Jordi Hays: it was like, it was like, OK, team whose succession.
[01:19:06] Jordi Hays: Oh, yeah.
[01:19:07] Jordi Hays: So it was like, that is what we were going for.
[01:19:09] Jackson Dahl: That is what we were going for.
[01:19:11] Jackson Dahl: That is shareable too.
[01:19:12] Jackson Dahl: Because you are setting up somebody else's punch line.
[01:19:14] Jackson Dahl: Yeah.
[01:19:14] Jackson Dahl: Which is really powerful.
[01:19:16] Jordi Hays: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:19:17] Jordi Hays: And so that I was like, OK, you nailed it.
[01:19:19] Jordi Hays: That's what we were going through.
[01:19:20] Jordi Hays: We filmed a succession style
[01:19:22] Jordi Hays: of IBREAL for a podcast that is three months old.
[01:19:27] Jordi Hays: It doesn't have revenue yet.
[01:19:28] Jordi Hays: It's a couple of thousand viewers.
[01:19:29] John Coogan: Yeah, listen.
[01:19:30] John Coogan: And so, yeah, I think self-awareness, too,
[01:19:35] Jordi Hays: is like super-deep.
[01:19:36] Jordi Hays: I do think there was something that might be
[01:19:37] John Coogan: they're inspiring in the sense that it's just like,
[01:19:39] John Coogan: oh, wow, they're taking this really seriously.
[01:19:41] John Coogan: People in tech like to see that people are taking serious.
[01:19:43] John Coogan: It's the high and low together again.
[01:19:45] Jackson Dahl: Exactly.
[01:19:45] Jackson Dahl: It was like, it was clear you were taking it seriously enough
[01:19:49] Jackson Dahl: to do the video, but also you were making fun of yourself
[01:19:50] Jackson Dahl: a little bit.
[01:19:51] Jackson Dahl: Yep.
[01:19:52] Yeah, so I think it's an interesting dynamic where
[01:19:54] Jordi Hays: the audience is really smart.
[01:19:56] Jordi Hays: They will see through whatever.
[01:19:58] Jordi Hays: You need to be authentic because they're
[01:20:00] Jordi Hays: going to see through it, especially over time.
[01:20:02] Jordi Hays: Maybe you can get away with a launch video.
[01:20:04] Jordi Hays: People don't really realize that this is not a serious team
[01:20:08] Jordi Hays: or whatever, but over time in the fullness of you trying
[01:20:10] Jordi Hays: to market to your industry people figure out.
[01:20:13] Jordi Hays: But they don't have an appetite to have to work
[01:20:18] Jordi Hays: to understand what you're doing.
[01:20:20] Jordi Hays: And so you can assume that they're smart,
[01:20:22] Jordi Hays: but assume they're going to not
[01:20:23] Jordi Hays: going to put any effort into really understanding,
[01:20:25] Jordi Hays: because they just don't care.
[01:20:26] Jordi Hays: And that's fine.
[01:20:28] You maybe even more than marketers are
[01:20:32] Jackson Dahl: to kind of like quietly brilliant brand guys.
[01:20:37] Jackson Dahl: When I think about the stuff you guys have done historically,
[01:20:40] both Lucy and Jordy's earlier point,
[01:20:42] Jackson Dahl: so maybe more than anything else.
[01:20:44] Jackson Dahl: And everything you've done has spiked
[01:20:48] Jackson Dahl: on a bunch of dimensions, but especially brand.
[01:20:50] Jackson Dahl: It goes back to our influences conversation.
[01:20:52] Jackson Dahl: I think as an industry, maybe nothing tech
[01:20:54] Jackson Dahl: is worse at than brand, or maybe even nothing
[01:20:57] Jackson Dahl: that tech cares less about.
[01:20:59] I'm curious how maybe what does brand mean to you
[01:21:04] Jackson Dahl: and to what actually makes a great brand.
[01:21:06] Jackson Dahl: But by the way, talk about a great brand.
[01:21:07] Jackson Dahl: Jordy's way better at this than I am.
[01:21:09] John Coogan: I've been along for the ride with most of the other brands.
[01:21:12] John Coogan: Yeah, I think part of it goes back to branded native
[01:21:14] Jordi Hays: and working with so many companies.
[01:21:17] Jordi Hays: And understanding what is working,
[01:21:20] Jordi Hays: both from like a strategy channel standpoint,
[01:21:23] Jordi Hays: and then how brands actually get made.
[01:21:26] Jordi Hays: Like great brands do not start with spending $300,000
[01:21:31] Jordi Hays: on a branding agency and doing this brand a package.
[01:21:35] Jordi Hays: Like they're typically very, they typically happen
[01:21:38] Jordi Hays: very organically.
[01:21:39] Jordi Hays: Great brand is not a logo.
[01:21:41] Jordi Hays: A great brand is not a website.
[01:21:42] Jordi Hays: A great brand is like the culmination
[01:21:46] Jordi Hays: of what you make a group of people feel over time.
[01:21:50] Jordi Hays: So it's that going back to that.
[01:21:52] Jordi Hays: A great brand is educating the audience.
[01:21:54] Jordi Hays: A great brand is like not, sometimes you
[01:21:57] Jordi Hays: can do multiple of them.
[01:21:59] Jordi Hays: But a great brand is like making people
[01:22:02] Jordi Hays: feel something over and over and over and over
[01:22:04] Jordi Hays: until you stick in their mind.
[01:22:06] Jordi Hays: And so I just think that it's like a brand
[01:22:09] Jordi Hays: is the, again, basically average out everything
[01:22:14] Jordi Hays: that you've made somebody feel.
[01:22:15] Jordi Hays: An individual person on an individual level,
[01:22:18] Jordi Hays: you as a brand and that individual person.
[01:22:20] Jordi Hays: And so when you look at TBPN, it's like people
[01:22:23] Jordi Hays: like the TBPN brand because we've probably
[01:22:26] Jordi Hays: entertained them.
[01:22:26] Jordi Hays: We've made them laugh like hopefully a few times, right?
[01:22:29] Jordi Hays: Hopefully a bunch of times, right?
[01:22:30] Jordi Hays: And that's like one of our KPIs is just like again,
[01:22:34] Jordi Hays: like making people laugh, like making people not like.
[01:22:37] Jordi Hays: On the second, third, fourth, fifth times are as good or better,
[01:22:40] Jackson Dahl: too.
[01:22:41] Jackson Dahl: Yeah.
[01:22:42] Jordi Hays: So we joke, we joke originally.
[01:22:44] Jordi Hays: I forget at some point or another, we were like,
[01:22:46] Jordi Hays: this wouldn't be possible if we weren't able to fork over 300,000.
[01:22:51] Jordi Hays: People would ask us, how much did you spend on the technology
[01:22:55] Jordi Hays: brothers brand is so great?
[01:22:56] Jordi Hays: How did you pull it off?
[01:22:57] Jordi Hays: And we were like, we just put the capital to work.
[01:23:00] Jordi Hays: And it's like, no, it's actually like we worked with.
[01:23:03] Jordi Hays: I think part of it's like building up a group of people.
[01:23:07] Jordi Hays: Usually, I think that great brand work is actually
[01:23:10] Jordi Hays: done externally.
[01:23:13] Jordi Hays: Any sort of key role, things that are done every single day
[01:23:17] Jordi Hays: in the organization, we in-house, right?
[01:23:19] Jordi Hays: We're not going to have production out of house, right?
[01:23:22] Jordi Hays: There's a lot of people that are professional podcasts
[01:23:25] Jordi Hays: that outsource production, right?
[01:23:27] Jordi Hays: And it's like, that's crazy.
[01:23:29] Jordi Hays: Your job is to make a piece of content,
[01:23:31] Jordi Hays: make it better every day.
[01:23:33] Brand where you're creating these artifacts that are sometimes
[01:23:37] Jordi Hays: evergreen, like a logo mark, sometimes something that just
[01:23:41] Jordi Hays: is used for a moment, like ad creative, that is really
[01:23:44] Jordi Hays: effective to constantly be going outside of the organization
[01:23:47] Jordi Hays: to bring in new ideas, right?
[01:23:49] Jordi Hays: And those people are thinking, oh, I saw this campaign
[01:23:52] Jordi Hays: that you've never heard of.
[01:23:53] Jordi Hays: Let's bring that in.
[01:23:54] Jordi Hays: And so part of it's like having that relationship
[01:23:56] Jordi Hays: with a group of people and then not getting stuck with one.
[01:24:00] Jordi Hays: So it's like, we've worked with different people for merch.
[01:24:02] Jordi Hays: We've worked with different designers.
[01:24:04] Jordi Hays: We have core partners that we go back to a lot,
[01:24:07] Jordi Hays: but we're constantly willing to bring in new people.
[01:24:11] Jordi Hays: And I do think that, yeah, taste is a factor.
[01:24:16] Jordi Hays: You look at two logos, but it's ultimately just a personal thing.
[01:24:21] Jordi Hays: It's like, you have a point of view, critical.
[01:24:24] Jackson Dahl: You clearly know how to work with all kinds
[01:24:26] Jackson Dahl: of different, great external creatives,
[01:24:28] Jackson Dahl: but that does not work if you don't know what you like.
[01:24:30] Jackson Dahl: And I think that might be one of the other challenges.
[01:24:32] Jackson Dahl: I also, we also don't.
[01:24:35] Jordi Hays: I also cherish that dynamic.
[01:24:39] Jordi Hays: Like I don't negotiate heavily with creative talent.
[01:24:44] Jordi Hays: And that might sound crazy because your job
[01:24:46] Jordi Hays: is to get great services for the lowest possible price.
[01:24:50] Jordi Hays: But if you go into a dynamic with a designer,
[01:24:54] Jordi Hays: I certainly will get a proposal.
[01:24:57] Jordi Hays: And I'll think that is wildly more than I value
[01:25:00] Jordi Hays: what we're trying to do here.
[01:25:02] Jordi Hays: Thank you.
[01:25:03] Jordi Hays: We're going to go elsewhere.
[01:25:05] Jordi Hays: But if I'm close in the ballpark with a creative
[01:25:08] Jordi Hays: that I want to do work with, I'm not sitting there being like,
[01:25:12] Jordi Hays: hey, you pitched us 20K, our budget is 6K,
[01:25:16] Jordi Hays: because sometimes they'll opt in,
[01:25:18] Jordi Hays: but then in their head, they're thinking,
[01:25:20] Jordi Hays: I'm doing 6K work.
[01:25:22] Jordi Hays: Yeah, on the branding thing, I feel like every brand
[01:25:26] John Coogan: is spiky in a bunch of different ways.
[01:25:28] John Coogan: There's a bunch of different elements
[01:25:30] John Coogan: that kind of describe the brand.
[01:25:31] John Coogan: And it's not just an arrow in one direction.
[01:25:35] John Coogan: It's like a whole bunch of things.
[01:25:36] John Coogan: And we've kind of done that with the brand world.
[01:25:38] John Coogan: And I feel like one thing that we've had a lot of fun with
[01:25:41] John Coogan: is when we find a thread to pull on
[01:25:43] John Coogan: that we're getting some brand value out of,
[01:25:46] John Coogan: we just keep pulling on it as long as possible.
[01:25:49] John Coogan: And at some point, we were riffing about horses,
[01:25:54] John Coogan: being like, it was related to technology journalists
[01:25:58] John Coogan: being rich and nepo babies, and they all have horses.
[01:26:03] John Coogan: And then that turned into like, we're into horses,
[01:26:06] John Coogan: and we recommend buying horses.
[01:26:08] John Coogan: And then if your daughter's not a horse girl,
[01:26:09] Jordi Hays: by the time she's five, you failed.
[01:26:11] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[01:26:12] Jordi Hays: And then at some point, I was like,
[01:26:14] John Coogan: I'm actually going to go and become a horse expert.
[01:26:17] John Coogan: And so I like reworked my entire YouTube algorithm,
[01:26:20] John Coogan: just serve me dressage content
[01:26:22] John Coogan: and understand all these different horse breeds.
[01:26:25] John Coogan: And it's something where it's just like,
[01:26:27] John Coogan: and that's probably manifested
[01:26:28] John Coogan: in like the horse behind our, exactly.
[01:26:30] John Coogan: Like the horse behind us.
[01:26:31] John Coogan: And so it's just like all these little things that are not,
[01:26:34] John Coogan: it's not just like, oh, we need to stat you in the horse.
[01:26:36] John Coogan: It's like, there's this like lineage in the brand.
[01:26:38] John Coogan: This is the world's all through.
[01:26:39] John Coogan: There's also, yeah, so there's two more things
[01:26:41] Jordi Hays: that I pull on.
[01:26:42] Jordi Hays: One, we're in an era where you have less control
[01:26:45] Jordi Hays: over your brand than ever,
[01:26:46] Jordi Hays: because your brand is created by, in our case,
[01:26:48] Jordi Hays: like we have a bunch of people here in the studio.
[01:26:51] Jordi Hays: Like when Tyler posts, that is part of our brand.
[01:26:54] Jordi Hays: When Ben posts, that's part of our brand.
[01:26:56] Jordi Hays: When Brandon posts, that's part of our brand.
[01:26:58] Jordi Hays: And so, and so,
[01:26:59] Jordi Hays: we're supposed to about you.
[01:27:00] Jordi Hays: It's a little bit part of your brand.
[01:27:01] Jordi Hays: Yeah, that was even, we, even with the merch,
[01:27:04] Jordi Hays: like part of, part of like,
[01:27:05] Jordi Hays: we didn't sell merch originally,
[01:27:07] Jordi Hays: because we wanted to effectively like control
[01:27:10] Jordi Hays: who was wearing our logo.
[01:27:13] Jordi Hays: And over time, over time that, that will,
[01:27:16] Jordi Hays: you can't, you know, keep total.
[01:27:18] Jordi Hays: But I remember one day I texted John,
[01:27:20] Jordi Hays: somebody like had a TPPN hat,
[01:27:22] Jordi Hays: and I was like, how did this person get it?
[01:27:24] Jordi Hays: Because like, this person is not somebody
[01:27:26] Jordi Hays: that I went online with.
[01:27:27] Jordi Hays: Just off brand.
[01:27:28] Jordi Hays: Yeah, just, and so, yeah, one you have,
[01:27:31] Jordi Hays: you have more control over your brand than ever,
[01:27:32] Jordi Hays: because you can like constantly adapt,
[01:27:34] Jordi Hays: and you can change, you know, you can change,
[01:27:36] Jordi Hays: it's not like we have packaging that's like,
[01:27:38] Jordi Hays: oh, if we want to change the logo,
[01:27:40] Jordi Hays: it's like six months, so, you know,
[01:27:42] Jordi Hays: we have to do a new run.
[01:27:43] Jordi Hays: It's like, no, we can change anything at any time.
[01:27:45] Jordi Hays: But you have less control because your team
[01:27:47] Jordi Hays: is constantly creating it.
[01:27:48] Jordi Hays: And this goes the same, is the same for, for every company.
[01:27:51] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[01:27:53] Jordi Hays: Oh, one more thing I forgot,
[01:27:54] Jordi Hays: because I said there was a second part of that.
[01:27:56] Jordi Hays: Something that we did it early on,
[01:27:57] Jordi Hays: and I think every company should do this,
[01:27:59] Jordi Hays: is like, we made a sheet of like,
[01:28:02] Jordi Hays: these are our friends, these are our enemies.
[01:28:06] Jordi Hays: This is what we, this is what we,
[01:28:08] Jordi Hays: yeah, yeah, yeah, it was like,
[01:28:10] Jordi Hays: it was like, HVAC, Roll-Ups,
[01:28:12] Jordi Hays: where the enemies, yeah.
[01:28:14] Jordi Hays: It was like the CCP.
[01:28:15] John Coogan: Yeah, yeah, it was silly stuff, right?
[01:28:18] John Coogan: It's not like we're sitting, it's not a spiked show.
[01:28:21] Jordi Hays: But silly stuff, and we kept it on the table for the first.
[01:28:24] Jordi Hays: First.
[01:28:25] Jordi Hays: Also memes and sections and phrases.
[01:28:29] John Coogan: phrases.
[01:28:29] John Coogan: All this again to the world,
[01:28:32] John Coogan: but the world of the brand language as well.
[01:28:34] John Coogan: And who was, who were people that we were going to go back to,
[01:28:37] John Coogan: ideas, themes that we were going to go back to.
[01:28:39] John Coogan: All of that was super, super helpful.
[01:28:41] John Coogan: Yeah, and so we constantly update that,
[01:28:44] Jordi Hays: and that is part of how you do the world building.
[01:28:46] Jordi Hays: You don't just, you don't want to leave it a chance of like,
[01:28:48] Jordi Hays: hey, this thing was super funny on episode six.
[01:28:51] Jordi Hays: We want to bring that back, right?
[01:28:52] Jordi Hays: And so there's people in our audience.
[01:28:55] Jordi Hays: If we're talking about a car, they'll be like,
[01:28:57] Jordi Hays: ah, it looks cool, but it's not as nice as like a Nissan
[01:29:00] Jordi Hays: cross-cabry of LA like 2012 or whatever.
[01:29:04] Jordi Hays: And it's like, that's just like a riff that we've had of like,
[01:29:07] Jordi Hays: it might be the perfect car.
[01:29:08] Jordi Hays: It's like a, it's a.
[01:29:09] Jordi Hays: It's a two-door convertible SUV.
[01:29:11] John Coogan: What more do you need?
[01:29:12] John Coogan: That's, there's not a lot of options
[01:29:13] Jordi Hays: if you want a two-door convertible SUV.
[01:29:15] Jordi Hays: It's kind of that simple.
[01:29:17] Jackson Dahl: Yeah, there's something to come back to too.
[01:29:18] Jackson Dahl: It makes, it's a payoff for the person who's been with you.
[01:29:21] Jackson Dahl: Exactly.
[01:29:22] Jordi Hays: Yeah, also a super steep learning curve with the show.
[01:29:25] Jordi Hays: Like we don't tell you, you know, part,
[01:29:27] Jordi Hays: like we're making a decision to not say what AWS is.
[01:29:31] Jordi Hays: We don't, we don't, traditional television will be like,
[01:29:34] Jordi Hays: AWS is a cloud computing division.
[01:29:36] Jordi Hays: It's good.
[01:29:37] Jordi Hays: Everything we've had better.
[01:29:38] Jordi Hays: And it's like part of that steep learning curve
[01:29:39] Jordi Hays: is very powerful because people ramp up and then they're like,
[01:29:42] Jordi Hays: okay, I'm, I'm really a part of it.
[01:29:44] Jordi Hays: And it feels like you're actually talking to me.
[01:29:45] Jordi Hays: I mean, you can see it in the New York Times,
[01:29:46] John Coogan: like sports center for the LinkedIn crowd,
[01:29:48] John Coogan: like more people would be like, clips for T-Pot.
[01:29:52] John Coogan: Like that would be another way to like frame the show.
[01:29:55] John Coogan: You know, but like, like they needed to put it in like these,
[01:29:58] John Coogan: like, you know, universal terms.
[01:29:59] John Coogan: And like when we do a little bit of that, but not a lot here.
[01:30:02] John Coogan: Yeah, yeah, because we're, yeah, focused on that.
[01:30:04] John Coogan: I love that.
[01:30:06] Jackson Dahl: Maybe the Bible will be exposed.
[01:30:07] Jackson Dahl: The brand Bible will be exposed someday.
[01:30:10] Yeah, we talked about it a little earlier.
[01:30:12] Jackson Dahl: You have this amazing pace.
[01:30:14] Jackson Dahl: And I think you guys are both very like pro experimentation.
[01:30:17] Jackson Dahl: On the other hand, you've talked a lot about the like,
[01:30:19] Jackson Dahl: center or mongerish idea of like doing one thing
[01:30:22] Jackson Dahl: and being really focused.
[01:30:25] Jackson Dahl: You had a bunch of interns here.
[01:30:26] Jackson Dahl: You have a few less now, but I wonder what goes in,
[01:30:29] Jackson Dahl: maybe just for the two of you, or, or, or broadly,
[01:30:31] Jackson Dahl: the thing you're building, like what goes into fostering
[01:30:33] Jackson Dahl: a culture that is super pro experimentation on one hand,
[01:30:36] Jackson Dahl: and then also like knows what to hold on to
[01:30:39] Jackson Dahl: and not change and what to say no to.
[01:30:42] Yeah, it's, we don't have a hard and fast rule.
[01:30:45] John Coogan: There is like an algorithm for this.
[01:30:47] John Coogan: It's an explorer versus exploit.
[01:30:49] John Coogan: I think it's mostly just everyone knows what they have to do.
[01:30:54] John Coogan: They're all chop and wood.
[01:30:56] John Coogan: They're all knowing what works and getting that done every day.
[01:31:00] John Coogan: And then we're constantly lobbying new ideas and tests
[01:31:04] John Coogan: faster than people can go and like actually run the tests
[01:31:07] John Coogan: and implement them so they kind of a back log of new ideas.
[01:31:09] John Coogan: But then people also experiment within
[01:31:11] John Coogan: what whatever they're doing.
[01:31:13] Jordi Hays: I think a, yeah, part of, and this is specific to content
[01:31:18] Jordi Hays: businesses where content is ultimately the product.
[01:31:22] Jordi Hays: You have to figure out what is evergreen
[01:31:24] Jordi Hays: and what you just need to make slightly better every day.
[01:31:27] Jordi Hays: And then you need to figure out stuff that like works
[01:31:29] Jordi Hays: momentarily, but is not durable.
[01:31:31] Jordi Hays: And there's a lot of that on the internet where
[01:31:33] Jordi Hays: if you can create something novel, like a cinematic video,
[01:31:37] Jordi Hays: that works really well earlier this year.
[01:31:40] Jordi Hays: And by summer, a company thing.
[01:31:42] Jordi Hays: Yeah, yeah.
[01:31:43] Jordi Hays: And by summer, it stopped working well.
[01:31:45] Jordi Hays: We couldn't do a vibe real every month.
[01:31:47] John Coogan: It's just not possible.
[01:31:48] John Coogan: Like physically, physically we, we have the talent.
[01:31:51] Jordi Hays: We were doing them in a day.
[01:31:53] John Coogan: And they were turning it up.
[01:31:54] John Coogan: But it's just like, yeah, it lost, it was like novel.
[01:31:59] John Coogan: It was not like durable, something that people
[01:32:01] John Coogan: want to consume on a regular basis.
[01:32:03] What was, what's most, what do you think would have been
[01:32:05] Jackson Dahl: most surprising to you either six or 12 months ago about this?
[01:32:10] Probably the meta-connect moment.
[01:32:13] John Coogan: The second interview is us, or the second video
[01:32:17] John Coogan: that we filmed, the one that I mentioned earlier is us
[01:32:19] John Coogan: talking about the meta-ray bands alone in this room.
[01:32:23] John Coogan: And then what, 10 months later, we're interviewing Mark Zuckerberg
[01:32:26] John Coogan: about that exact moment.
[01:32:27] John Coogan: Oh, wait, also Jim Cameron, which was like this crazy.
[01:32:30] Jackson Dahl: I would say though, I would say.
[01:32:34] John Coogan: Just because my initial idea for the format
[01:32:36] John Coogan: was like, no guess ever, no traveling ever, just two people.
[01:32:41] John Coogan: I was like, that's the secret sauce.
[01:32:43] John Coogan: We keep it that way forever.
[01:32:45] Jordi Hays: How great is a deva podcast?
[01:32:46] Jordi Hays: And you don't have to worry about guessing.
[01:32:47] Jordi Hays: You don't have to book guests.
[01:32:48] Jordi Hays: And you don't have to travel.
[01:32:49] John Coogan: This is the secret.
[01:32:50] John Coogan: Just success.
[01:32:51] John Coogan: This is amazing.
[01:32:52] John Coogan: Let's just do this forever.
[01:32:53] John Coogan: And I've never changed it.
[01:32:53] John Coogan: But at the same time, I think that while we are open
[01:32:58] Jordi Hays: to experimenting in real time, we're hypercalculated.
[01:33:02] Jordi Hays: And I would say when we were early on
[01:33:05] Jordi Hays: talking with Ram at the end of last year,
[01:33:08] Jordi Hays: they had seen about six weeks of the show.
[01:33:13] Jordi Hays: And they were like, OK, this is cool.
[01:33:15] Jordi Hays: But pretty much everything about this year has been premeditated.
[01:33:19] Jordi Hays: We knew we were going to go live.
[01:33:20] Jordi Hays: We knew we were going to add guests.
[01:33:22] Jordi Hays: We knew we were going to do an extraordinarily high volume
[01:33:27] Jordi Hays: of guests and the only.
[01:33:29] Jordi Hays: We did after a couple of weeks.
[01:33:32] The first, when we sat down to work the first episode,
[01:33:35] John Coogan: we were like, no guests.
[01:33:36] John Coogan: And then like three episodes in and we were like, what is this?
[01:33:38] John Coogan: Yeah, yeah.
[01:33:38] John Coogan: So I'll give you an example, though.
[01:33:40] Jordi Hays: We love the name technology brothers.
[01:33:43] Jordi Hays: And we've told the story before.
[01:33:44] Jordi Hays: But unfortunately, it would get abbreviated.
[01:33:47] Jordi Hays: So people would call us the tech bros, which
[01:33:50] Jordi Hays: made our skin crawl, basically.
[01:33:51] Jordi Hays: And one is actually literally the thing you were talking about.
[01:33:53] Jordi Hays: Yeah, we were trying to avoid.
[01:33:55] Jordi Hays: And so it realized that we wanted to do this for decades.
[01:34:00] Jordi Hays: And so we wanted to adapt.
[01:34:02] Jordi Hays: And so the name TbPN was chosen one, because it
[01:34:07] Jordi Hays: could get a four letter dot com, which is insane, which is
[01:34:10] Jordi Hays: a huge beast of this stuff.
[01:34:12] John Coogan: Not all the handles are available to us.
[01:34:14] John Coogan: So we're like, they weren't available.
[01:34:16] John Coogan: But we pretty much were out of here.
[01:34:17] John Coogan: They weren't actively used.
[01:34:19] John Coogan: There was no trademarks and stuff.
[01:34:20] John Coogan: So it was like, it was gettable across everything, which
[01:34:22] John Coogan: was awesome.
[01:34:23] John Coogan: But the reason that that made sense, it didn't make sense
[01:34:25] Jordi Hays: because we weren't building a network.
[01:34:27] Jordi Hays: But it made sense because we were like, we
[01:34:28] Jordi Hays: want this to be a place that the Mag 7 comes on right
[01:34:31] Jordi Hays: regularly.
[01:34:32] Jordi Hays: And they are much more likely.
[01:34:35] Jordi Hays: Their PR departments are much more likely to be like, sure,
[01:34:38] Jordi Hays: I reviewed TbPN.
[01:34:40] Jordi Hays: It looks cool.
[01:34:41] Jordi Hays: You should go on TbPN.
[01:34:42] Jordi Hays: And then you should go on technology.
[01:34:44] Jordi Hays: Let's go hang with the tech pros.
[01:34:45] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[01:34:45] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[01:34:46] John Coogan: As opposed to like, like, Theo Vaughn can be a comic.
[01:34:49] John Coogan: But then he can just be like the name Theo Vaughn.
[01:34:51] John Coogan: And the name can evolve to mean anything.
[01:34:53] John Coogan: And now it means a more serious process.
[01:34:55] John Coogan: He really loves it.
[01:34:55] John Coogan: I seem to remember at some point, we did pick TbPN
[01:35:00] John Coogan: because of the initialism technology brothers, Tb.
[01:35:03] John Coogan: But then we shouldn't keep the Tb around.
[01:35:07] John Coogan: That was the issue.
[01:35:08] John Coogan: Well, no, it was like I was looking for short domains
[01:35:16] Jordi Hays: that featured Tb.
[01:35:18] Jordi Hays: But from the beginning, it was technology business
[01:35:21] Jordi Hays: programming network inspired by ESPN.
[01:35:25] Jordi Hays: You've referenced, and it was you, referenced the MKBHD
[01:35:29] Jackson Dahl: idea where basically if you don't love the content,
[01:35:33] Jackson Dahl: you're not going to be able to do it forever.
[01:35:35] Jackson Dahl: You guys are currently doing three hours of live broadcasting
[01:35:37] Jackson Dahl: every single day.
[01:35:39] That's a lot of endurance for a year, a little on five.
[01:35:41] Jackson Dahl: Or if you really want to go crazy, like Charlie Rose
[01:35:44] Jackson Dahl: and Johnny Carson did this for 30 years, I don't know where you're going.
[01:35:47] Jackson Dahl: Jim Kramer just celebrated 30.
[01:35:50] Jackson Dahl: How do you set yourself up for that kind of endurance?
[01:35:55] Even just find it.
[01:35:55] There's never, like, the news has been something
[01:35:59] Jordi Hays: I've loved my entire life.
[01:36:02] Jordi Hays: Since I could read, I would read the newspaper every morning.
[01:36:06] Jordi Hays: It would be on that.
[01:36:07] Jordi Hays: My dad would get up before me.
[01:36:08] Jordi Hays: It'd be on the coffee table.
[01:36:09] Jordi Hays: He would have looked through it already.
[01:36:11] Jordi Hays: I would pick it up.
[01:36:11] Jordi Hays: I would read through it.
[01:36:12] Jordi Hays: My interest in terms of the content evolved.
[01:36:15] Jordi Hays: I used to be probably more into geopolitics than I am now.
[01:36:20] Jordi Hays: And just like political content in general
[01:36:23] Jordi Hays: was probably more appealing when I was younger
[01:36:25] Jordi Hays: and just trying to understand the world.
[01:36:28] Jordi Hays: But even as soon as I was in middle school and high school,
[01:36:31] Jordi Hays: it was like I would get out from school
[01:36:34] Jordi Hays: and I would refresh TechCrunch.
[01:36:35] Jordi Hays: And I'd be like, what happened today in Tech?
[01:36:38] Jordi Hays: And so there's never, and then even continuing
[01:36:42] Jordi Hays: into my adult life, no matter what I was working on,
[01:36:47] Jordi Hays: I was still interested in what was happening broadly.
[01:36:50] Jordi Hays: And so I think that the confidence that we have around
[01:36:55] Jordi Hays: being able to do this for decades
[01:36:56] Jordi Hays: is that I cannot imagine a world in the future
[01:36:59] Jordi Hays: where I wake up and I'm not interested in understanding
[01:37:03] Jordi Hays: and talking about what's going on in the world.
[01:37:06] Jordi Hays: It would be impossible if we had to do the exact same show
[01:37:08] John Coogan: every day.
[01:37:09] John Coogan: Like if it was a play with a script,
[01:37:12] John Coogan: then we had to tell the same story, the story of Apple.
[01:37:15] John Coogan: And it's like the story of Apple every single day
[01:37:17] John Coogan: for three hours.
[01:37:18] John Coogan: And then the story of Apple the next day,
[01:37:19] John Coogan: that would be a waking nightmare.
[01:37:22] John Coogan: But the fact that the news cycle changes
[01:37:23] John Coogan: and you can go wherever you want within this particular
[01:37:26] John Coogan: niche of technology.
[01:37:27] John Coogan: I mean, I saw this on my YouTube channel.
[01:37:30] John Coogan: I would talk about AI and then Defense Tech got big.
[01:37:33] John Coogan: I talked about Defense Tech.
[01:37:34] John Coogan: I did some videos on the Metaverse and VR and crypto.
[01:37:37] John Coogan: And you can move around within the,
[01:37:39] John Coogan: and you're not, you don't need to be that niche.
[01:37:41] John Coogan: If you were to try to speculate on what will be different
[01:37:47] Jackson Dahl: in five years about the format, is there anything,
[01:37:51] Jackson Dahl: or maybe even aspirational, is there anything
[01:37:53] Jackson Dahl: you would hope that will change?
[01:37:58] I think the chat experience will change a little bit.
[01:38:04] John Coogan: Most linear, I think all TV actually doesn't have a chat.
[01:38:07] John Coogan: It would be funny if Bloomberg read the Bloomberg chat.
[01:38:10] John Coogan: I was thinking about that the other day.
[01:38:12] John Coogan: But I believe Pat McAfee does read from the chat,
[01:38:15] John Coogan: but only at a certain interval.
[01:38:17] John Coogan: The chat's going crazy all the time,
[01:38:19] John Coogan: because there's so many people chatting all the time.
[01:38:21] John Coogan: But then they will take questions at a certain moment.
[01:38:24] John Coogan: And I think that right now, we kind of go to the chat
[01:38:27] John Coogan: if they have a zinger, or go to the chat if they have a
[01:38:29] John Coogan: question.
[01:38:30] John Coogan: Today we were live and the chat was saying,
[01:38:33] Jordi Hays: guys, you're on TV in France.
[01:38:35] Jordi Hays: Yeah, so we have to react to that.
[01:38:38] John Coogan: But I think that, as a streamer, one thing I heard
[01:38:42] John Coogan: from a very popular streamer was he was saying that
[01:38:45] John Coogan: he sees reading chat as a skill.
[01:38:49] John Coogan: You ever watch speed?
[01:38:50] Jackson Dahl: Yes.
[01:38:51] Jackson Dahl: That is Twitch in 15 years.
[01:38:53] Jackson Dahl: It's incredible.
[01:38:53] Jackson Dahl: Incredible.
[01:38:55] John Coogan: It's very, truly.
[01:38:56] John Coogan: It's very clearly its own skill.
[01:38:59] John Coogan: And we have the skill to keep a conversation going.
[01:39:03] John Coogan: And if I notice, Jority has to talk to a guest on a text
[01:39:07] John Coogan: message, I can just go to the camera and say,
[01:39:10] John Coogan: OK, let me read from this Wall Street Journal article.
[01:39:12] John Coogan: And the other thing that's so cool about it is to hand off.
[01:39:15] John Coogan: We can pass the ball back and forth very easily.
[01:39:17] John Coogan: But integrating chat will change a lot.
[01:39:20] John Coogan: But the chat is part of the show, too, because we'll
[01:39:22] Jordi Hays: be talking about something.
[01:39:23] Jordi Hays: I remember last week we were talking about model adoption
[01:39:27] Jordi Hays: on OpenRouter.
[01:39:29] And we missed a key thing, which was two out of the three
[01:39:32] Jordi Hays: top models were free, and the others were paid.
[01:39:34] Jordi Hays: And very, very obvious.
[01:39:35] Jordi Hays: But in the moment, we didn't put that together.
[01:39:37] Jordi Hays: Somebody in the chat is like, yeah, this is important.
[01:39:39] Jordi Hays: And so not only did that make the analysis better,
[01:39:43] Jordi Hays: it was like community sourced.
[01:39:45] Jordi Hays: If you're listening to the recording, which is a large amount
[01:39:48] Jordi Hays: of the majority of our audience is not watching live today,
[01:39:51] Jordi Hays: you now get that extra context that if John and I were just
[01:39:54] Jordi Hays: recording by ourselves, we never would have made it in.
[01:39:57] Jordi Hays: And so that feedback loop is super powerful.
[01:40:00] Jordi Hays: And that's a very, very important network effect.
[01:40:02] John Coogan: And something that's very, very durable over time,
[01:40:04] John Coogan: because it actually makes the show better
[01:40:06] John Coogan: and feeds back into itself in a way that is,
[01:40:09] John Coogan: it's important in a very different way
[01:40:12] John Coogan: than just like you got a lot of listeners.
[01:40:15] John Coogan: Yes.
[01:40:16] Jackson Dahl: And when you get through a certain scale, too,
[01:40:17] Jackson Dahl: you have enough affordances with the chat.
[01:40:19] Jackson Dahl: They are going to learn.
[01:40:21] Jackson Dahl: This is what the crazy high-end speed do.
[01:40:24] Jackson Dahl: Kyle or Shumie, speed will literally be like,
[01:40:27] Jackson Dahl: I have created a choose your own adventure.
[01:40:28] Jackson Dahl: I'm going to do one of two things, chat, which should I do,
[01:40:31] Jackson Dahl: which is cool to see.
[01:40:34] Jackson Dahl: One thing that a few people asked me to ask you on Twitter
[01:40:36] Jackson Dahl: that I like is I'd love to hear what just like a day
[01:40:40] Jackson Dahl: looks like from end to end for both of you.
[01:40:43] Jackson Dahl: It's fun.
[01:40:44] Jordi Hays: Same day, every day, Jim 630 to 8, breakfast 8 to 9,
[01:40:53] Jordi Hays: studio here at 9.
[01:40:55] Jordi Hays: Again, John quickly goes into writing the newsletter.
[01:41:00] Jordi Hays: I typically will have some amount of Zoom meetings
[01:41:02] Jordi Hays: during that time that are more just like focused on the business.
[01:41:06] Jordi Hays: And then, yeah, we have 9 to 11 to prep the show.
[01:41:10] Jordi Hays: We usually, if we're running ahead of schedule,
[01:41:13] Jordi Hays: or actually dressed before like...
[01:41:16] Jordi Hays: A lot of mentions.
[01:41:17] Jordi Hays: A lot of times if you see the timer five minutes,
[01:41:21] John Coogan: four minutes, three minutes, we're getting dressed.
[01:41:24] And so there's, yeah, there's really,
[01:41:26] Jordi Hays: there's no time to be creative in that window.
[01:41:30] Jordi Hays: What I love about it is that your mood doesn't matter.
[01:41:35] Jordi Hays: How you feel doesn't matter, right?
[01:41:37] Jordi Hays: We have an obligation to go live.
[01:41:39] Jordi Hays: There's a countdown.
[01:41:40] Jordi Hays: Every day, there's a countdown.
[01:41:41] Jordi Hays: And so in building companies previously,
[01:41:45] Jordi Hays: it's like if you wake up and you're feeling under the weather,
[01:41:48] Jordi Hays: you're like, ah, maybe I'm not going to add that.
[01:41:50] Jordi Hays: Sales called in my calendar.
[01:41:51] Jordi Hays: I'll add it to tomorrow.
[01:41:52] Jordi Hays: And so you're constantly kind of like negotiating with yourself.
[01:41:55] Jordi Hays: And we don't have the luxury of negotiating
[01:41:57] Jordi Hays: because we made a promise that we just,
[01:41:58] Jordi Hays: we go live every week.
[01:42:00] Jordi Hays: Taking one day off.
[01:42:00] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[01:42:01] John Coogan: We also took a good July 4th off.
[01:42:04] John Coogan: And then what about post-show?
[01:42:06] John Coogan: Well, so there's also, I would view the daily routine
[01:42:09] John Coogan: as like a narrowing of the aperture.
[01:42:10] John Coogan: So when we meet at the gym, we're often
[01:42:13] John Coogan: talking about stuff that might may or may not
[01:42:15] John Coogan: make it on the show.
[01:42:16] John Coogan: Oh, you know, watch this movie or what
[01:42:19] John Coogan: was going on just broadly in like group chats and online,
[01:42:22] John Coogan: like different news stories that are kicking around.
[01:42:25] John Coogan: And then by the time we're at breakfast,
[01:42:26] John Coogan: we're kind of honing in on like what the key topics are.
[01:42:29] John Coogan: And then once we get to the studio,
[01:42:31] John Coogan: we're actually like taking screenshots
[01:42:33] John Coogan: that you will see on the show of individual posts
[01:42:36] John Coogan: or Wall Street Journal articles.
[01:42:38] John Coogan: And then we're discussing during that 9 to 11.
[01:42:42] John Coogan: I'm writing the newsletter, but I'm also
[01:42:45] John Coogan: piecing together the order and I'm bouncing ideas
[01:42:47] John Coogan: off of your, like, hey, there's this Wall Street Journal
[01:42:50] John Coogan: article, there's these posts, like what do you
[01:42:53] John Coogan: want to kick off for?
[01:42:54] John Coogan: Yeah.
[01:42:54] John Coogan: So 24.7, we're sourcing content for the show.
[01:42:57] Jordi Hays: Yeah, getting closer.
[01:42:58] Jordi Hays: You're kind of compressing all this.
[01:42:59] Jackson Dahl: Exactly.
[01:43:00] Jackson Dahl: Yeah.
[01:43:01] Jordi Hays: And then the show ends.
[01:43:03] Jordi Hays: Usually we're pretty much caught up on the news.
[01:43:07] Jordi Hays: Like we try to make sure we're ending the show, covering
[01:43:09] Jordi Hays: what's been happening during the show effectively.
[01:43:12] Jordi Hays: Sometimes it's live.
[01:43:13] Jordi Hays: Other times we're kind of catching up.
[01:43:15] Jordi Hays: And then immediately there's new content being created,
[01:43:18] Jordi Hays: that is going into tomorrow's show.
[01:43:21] Jordi Hays: And so after the show, we'll eat lunch.
[01:43:23] Jordi Hays: We're usually talking about what worked well,
[01:43:25] Jordi Hays: what didn't, what we should change.
[01:43:27] Jordi Hays: We'll oftentimes change the show for the following days.
[01:43:31] Jordi Hays: We'd be like, OK, that was too many guests.
[01:43:33] Jordi Hays: We didn't get enough.
[01:43:34] Jordi Hays: The main thing we're trying to protect
[01:43:35] Jordi Hays: is like 90 minutes a day that we can just hang out.
[01:43:40] Jordi Hays: Because when you think about it, one of the challenges
[01:43:42] Jordi Hays: of doing guest segments on any type of media
[01:43:47] Jordi Hays: is that they're wildly unreliable.
[01:43:49] Jordi Hays: Who's going to fall?
[01:43:50] Jordi Hays: At times, it will be interviewing Andrew Sorkin today
[01:43:55] Jordi Hays: was super energizing.
[01:43:58] Jordi Hays: It made the show better.
[01:43:59] Jordi Hays: Super energizing.
[01:44:00] Jordi Hays: We would have been happy to keep doing that for much longer.
[01:44:04] Jordi Hays: And the whole chat was like, this is an amazing interview,
[01:44:06] John Coogan: great interview.
[01:44:07] John Coogan: I love this.
[01:44:08] John Coogan: Yeah, they're just really excited to hear from him.
[01:44:10] Jordi Hays: And it's helpful that he's a professional TV host.
[01:44:14] Jordi Hays: And it's not his first rodeo.
[01:44:16] Jordi Hays: And so the variability in the guest
[01:44:19] Jordi Hays: is a huge challenge because if somebody's coming on for 15 minutes
[01:44:22] Jordi Hays: and they come on, it's like, we know to show up with high energy.
[01:44:26] Jordi Hays: And we're here to put on a show.
[01:44:30] Jordi Hays: But they might come in with very low energy.
[01:44:32] Jordi Hays: And it's a big part of the reason for the gong on.
[01:44:34] Jordi Hays: Yeah, it can completely.
[01:44:35] Jordi Hays: The gong really hurt.
[01:44:36] Jordi Hays: It's like, if you're a founder and you raise $10 million,
[01:44:39] John Coogan: even if you're building some sort of boring, sass thing,
[01:44:42] John Coogan: and you're not the most high energy person,
[01:44:44] John Coogan: at least we're resetting the energy level up here,
[01:44:47] John Coogan: and you can laugh, and you can kind of be like, OK, well, yeah.
[01:44:50] John Coogan: But yeah, we see it in the metrics.
[01:44:53] Jordi Hays: Right?
[01:44:54] Jordi Hays: Yes, have much lower retention than the two of us.
[01:44:58] Jordi Hays: And so it's about protecting that time
[01:45:00] Jordi Hays: that we can just hang out.
[01:45:01] Jordi Hays: That's the most fun, energizing time for me.
[01:45:04] Jordi Hays: But if you think about it, it's like two out of 10 guests
[01:45:08] Jordi Hays: make the show better.
[01:45:09] Jordi Hays: There's a power law there.
[01:45:10] Jordi Hays: So maybe one is like, this is amazing.
[01:45:14] Jordi Hays: I wish that we had 90 minutes with this person.
[01:45:16] Jordi Hays: And there's also an advantage.
[01:45:18] Jordi Hays: Eight out of 10 are actually making the show slightly worse.
[01:45:20] Jordi Hays: It's like, well, that's not a great hit rate.
[01:45:23] Jordi Hays: We still want to talk to those people
[01:45:25] Jordi Hays: because they help inform the content.
[01:45:26] Jordi Hays: And they allow us to build relationships with people
[01:45:29] Jordi Hays: and understand.
[01:45:31] Jordi Hays: There's always some insight and some learning
[01:45:33] Jordi Hays: and some takeaway.
[01:45:34] Jordi Hays: And some people are good on a random Tuesday.
[01:45:37] John Coogan: Other people are amazing at a certain moment,
[01:45:39] John Coogan: like a VR founder who's building something completely
[01:45:46] John Coogan: independently and can talk trash about whatever
[01:45:49] John Coogan: the big company has just launched.
[01:45:50] John Coogan: They're great on that launch day, right?
[01:45:52] John Coogan: But then on an average day, you're just kind of like,
[01:45:54] John Coogan: you don't even have a product to launch right now.
[01:45:56] John Coogan: What are we talking about here?
[01:45:57] John Coogan: Yeah, the other thing is the live nature
[01:46:00] Jordi Hays: means that we have to adapt to what's happening.
[01:46:04] Jordi Hays: There's been times where we have four guests slated
[01:46:07] Jordi Hays: and then some big story breaks.
[01:46:09] Jordi Hays: And suddenly, we have to say, hey,
[01:46:11] Jordi Hays: we actually killed this product entirely.
[01:46:13] John Coogan: We, early one of the big viral days was crypto day.
[01:46:17] John Coogan: And we had the most insane lineup,
[01:46:20] John Coogan: critics and biology.
[01:46:21] John Coogan: We had Brian Armstrong from Coinbase.
[01:46:24] John Coogan: We had so many killers.
[01:46:26] John Coogan: So many of that sort of like the meta thing.
[01:46:28] Jackson Dahl: Yeah, it was very cool.
[01:46:30] John Coogan: But then what we realized was we tried to do it again
[01:46:32] John Coogan: with like an AI day.
[01:46:33] John Coogan: We had a whole bunch of AI researchers.
[01:46:35] John Coogan: But then that was the day that Trump and Elon broke up.
[01:46:38] John Coogan: And so all the chat was just like,
[01:46:40] John Coogan: and we didn't have these screens reading the chat.
[01:46:42] John Coogan: And so George was reading the chat on his computer
[01:46:44] John Coogan: and was like, John, we gotta talk about this.
[01:46:47] John Coogan: We got to pivot.
[01:46:49] John Coogan: And so we canceled a bunch of people, brought them on later.
[01:46:52] John Coogan: And we kind of realized like, you can't actually have
[01:46:55] John Coogan: like a conference about a specific topic
[01:46:57] John Coogan: if there's something else crazy that happens.
[01:46:58] John Coogan: Yeah, and the real live,
[01:47:00] Jordi Hays: and going in another story.
[01:47:02] Jordi Hays: So we were at the New York Stock Exchange
[01:47:04] Jordi Hays: for the Clarna IPO.
[01:47:05] Jordi Hays: Clarna.
[01:47:06] Jordi Hays: And about two hours in.
[01:47:08] Jordi Hays: Sigma was flawless.
[01:47:09] John Coogan: Sigma was the biggest story of the day.
[01:47:10] John Coogan: It was the current thing on tech Twitter.
[01:47:12] John Coogan: And we were even in our part.
[01:47:13] John Coogan: And it's hard to displace an IPO in terms of like,
[01:47:16] Jordi Hays: mine share, especially a company like Figma,
[01:47:18] Jordi Hays: which is like universally used and loved.
[01:47:20] Jordi Hays: Everyone knows doing it.
[01:47:21] Jordi Hays: But at the Clarna IPO, I got a text from the team.
[01:47:25] Jordi Hays: John didn't have his laptop pulled up
[01:47:27] Jordi Hays: and they were like, Charlie Kirk just got shot,
[01:47:30] Jordi Hays: like open your computer and I opened the computer
[01:47:33] Jordi Hays: and you know, see immediately the video.
[01:47:37] Jordi Hays: And so that dynamic is,
[01:47:41] Jordi Hays: how do you talk about by now, pay later in that story?
[01:47:43] John Coogan: Yeah, and you go from the euphoria of like,
[01:47:46] Jordi Hays: we're here to celebrate this team's like, you know,
[01:47:48] Jordi Hays: 15 year journey getting to this point.
[01:47:51] Jordi Hays: And then suddenly you have this like,
[01:47:52] Jordi Hays: absolutely horrific tragic event.
[01:47:55] Jordi Hays: And we do have to adjust to it.
[01:47:56] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[01:47:57] Jordi Hays: And it's a unique thing about news.
[01:47:59] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[01:48:00] Jordi Hays: And so we're like a podcast, like there could be
[01:48:02] Jordi Hays: something amazing or tragic that happens during the show.
[01:48:05] Jordi Hays: And it's not, you know, when people listen to this,
[01:48:09] Jordi Hays: they're not thinking, yeah.
[01:48:11] Jordi Hays: That was actually, you need to respond to this.
[01:48:13] Jordi Hays: And we haven't, I haven't seen my phone.
[01:48:15] Jordi Hays: I have no idea what's happening in that type of work.
[01:48:17] Jordi Hays: Yeah, that was actually a point where I thought
[01:48:19] John Coogan: it was really good to look to what,
[01:48:22] John Coogan: how legacy TV deals with that.
[01:48:24] John Coogan: And so on CNBC, they do a breaking news alert.
[01:48:27] John Coogan: They cut away from the business content.
[01:48:29] John Coogan: And they say, we have some breaking news.
[01:48:31] John Coogan: And we have tragedy has occurred here are the facts.
[01:48:34] John Coogan: And then they go back to it.
[01:48:35] John Coogan: But they're basically just kicking you over to NBC
[01:48:37] John Coogan: if you want to follow the full story.
[01:48:39] John Coogan: Because that's the way the breaking news will live.
[01:48:41] John Coogan: And I remember early, we were in the gym at our first studio.
[01:48:47] John Coogan: And the blue origin launched and just happened with Katy Perry.
[01:48:51] John Coogan: And Jeff Bezos is there looking absolutely shredded.
[01:48:55] John Coogan: And it was very funny to see because there were six TVs
[01:48:58] John Coogan: up on the wall, all to different channels.
[01:49:01] John Coogan: And you could see how each of them covered it differently.
[01:49:04] John Coogan: And so CBS, I believe, has Gail King who went to space.
[01:49:09] John Coogan: And so for her, it was like, for the entire channel,
[01:49:13] John Coogan: I mean, imagine that with one of your coworkers just went to space.
[01:49:15] John Coogan: Like, you're going to be like, it's wall to wall.
[01:49:17] John Coogan: The coverage all day. It's the super bowl for us.
[01:49:18] John Coogan: Like the person that you as a fan of this channel, no, is in space.
[01:49:23] John Coogan: We got a cover this all day long.
[01:49:24] John Coogan: Then on ABC, they didn't have one of their anchors go.
[01:49:27] John Coogan: But it was still like a great story.
[01:49:29] John Coogan: So they had some real cameras there.
[01:49:30] John Coogan: They probably spent like half an hour on it on CNN.
[01:49:34] John Coogan: They did like 10 minutes.
[01:49:35] John Coogan: And then on CNBC, they just put it picture in picture.
[01:49:38] John Coogan: The rocket came back.
[01:49:39] John Coogan: It's landed. Now let's go back to the stock market.
[01:49:41] John Coogan: And so like just sizing stories for your audience is really,
[01:49:46] John Coogan: really key.
[01:49:47] John Coogan: And knowing, OK, this one is a breaking news one liner.
[01:49:51] John Coogan: This is five minutes.
[01:49:52] John Coogan: This is a full hour.
[01:49:53] John Coogan: This is just back to not trying to do everything for everyone.
[01:49:56] Jackson Dahl: Exactly.
[01:49:56] Jackson Dahl: Yeah, exactly.
[01:49:59] Jackson Dahl: I have a few questions about you guys.
[01:50:01] Jackson Dahl: First and foremost, when we talked about it a bit,
[01:50:03] Jackson Dahl: but what makes this partnership special?
[01:50:05] Jackson Dahl: And maybe when did you know that there was something here?
[01:50:10] I mean, the early thing was definitely just the fact
[01:50:14] John Coogan: that we both had years and years of experience
[01:50:16] John Coogan: in the things that were important, which was YouTube,
[01:50:19] John Coogan: but on different sides, the actual content creation,
[01:50:22] John Coogan: you on the ad sales side.
[01:50:23] John Coogan: And so there was just a lot there.
[01:50:25] John Coogan: But then John's like one of the, yeah,
[01:50:28] John Coogan: John's one of the few people.
[01:50:32] Jordi Hays: And certainly like at the top of the list of people
[01:50:35] Jordi Hays: where when I talk about the things that I'm good at,
[01:50:38] Jordi Hays: like he's consistently bringing ideas that are better
[01:50:41] Jordi Hays: than my own.
[01:50:43] Jordi Hays: And so that dynamic is super powerful
[01:50:47] Jordi Hays: and to be entirely fixated on this.
[01:50:53] Jordi Hays: And I think we have distinct skill sets
[01:50:56] Jordi Hays: and distinct kind of focus areas in the business
[01:50:58] Jordi Hays: that made it powerful.
[01:51:00] Jordi Hays: But to consistently come to John with an idea
[01:51:06] Jordi Hays: and it's some idea in a space that I'm
[01:51:11] Jordi Hays: good at generating ideas.
[01:51:12] Jordi Hays: And like let's say it's an advertiser that we're working for.
[01:51:15] Jordi Hays: And I'm like, hey, I want to pitch them on this concept.
[01:51:18] Jordi Hays: It's not related to T.B. Piann.
[01:51:20] Jordi Hays: It's a campaign for their next product launch.
[01:51:23] Jordi Hays: And John will, and I come with an idea.
[01:51:25] Jordi Hays: And he's like, okay, what if you did it this way?
[01:51:27] Jordi Hays: And typically when I pitch those ideas to people,
[01:51:30] Jordi Hays: they're just like, that sounds great.
[01:51:32] Jordi Hays: And I'm not getting like, I'm not getting one up.
[01:51:35] Jordi Hays: And so when you have a partnership,
[01:51:36] Jordi Hays: it's like you want to be getting one up.
[01:51:38] Jordi Hays: Like all the time.
[01:51:39] Jordi Hays: That's like what makes a partnership great
[01:51:41] Jordi Hays: is that two people combining or creating something better
[01:51:45] Jordi Hays: than any one of them would do individually.
[01:51:48] Jordi Hays: The other thing that's real is like we never run out
[01:51:51] Jordi Hays: of things to talk about.
[01:51:52] Jordi Hays: So like if it's like a Friday and John is like driving
[01:51:58] Jordi Hays: to Santa Barbara and like, I'm going to Malibu
[01:52:02] Jordi Hays: and like instead of taking my, I have a driver
[01:52:06] Jordi Hays: because it's like an hour both ways every day.
[01:52:08] Jordi Hays: It's a lot.
[01:52:09] Jordi Hays: And I'll just be like, the drive,
[01:52:10] Jordi Hays: I'll just send the driver home like separately.
[01:52:12] Jordi Hays: And I'll be like, I'm riding with John.
[01:52:14] Jordi Hays: Yeah, we got to come more.
[01:52:15] Jordi Hays: John goes out of the way because we're like,
[01:52:17] Jordi Hays: yeah, like I didn't get quite enough time.
[01:52:19] Jordi Hays: There's a line in the New York Times profile.
[01:52:21] Jackson Dahl: The show doesn't look very different
[01:52:22] Jackson Dahl: from when we're hanging out offline.
[01:52:24] Jackson Dahl: I think that's very clear.
[01:52:25] Jackson Dahl: Yeah, there's every single day,
[01:52:27] Jordi Hays: there's moments off there that I wish were on air
[01:52:30] Jordi Hays: because it's pretty impossible to recreate that
[01:52:33] how we got to a conclusion or like a specific bit of line
[01:52:37] Jordi Hays: that you can't really recreate.
[01:52:39] John Coogan: And also, it's like if we had a line
[01:52:41] John Coogan: that we were like dying laughing at in the gym
[01:52:43] John Coogan: and you deliver it on the show again,
[01:52:45] John Coogan: it's hard to fake the mind reaction.
[01:52:47] John Coogan: On a time, yeah.
[01:52:48] John Coogan: I've had to do this a couple of times
[01:52:50] Jackson Dahl: where I had an interview where like we lost an hour
[01:52:52] Jackson Dahl: and we redid it and it's a different thing.
[01:52:55] Jackson Dahl: It's just something quite hard to work.
[01:52:57] Jackson Dahl: Is maybe the dumbest way to ask the question is
[01:53:02] Jackson Dahl: how important was Will Minidas?
[01:53:04] Jackson Dahl: Was he as important as he claims
[01:53:05] Jackson Dahl: to the formation of this partnership?
[01:53:08] Jackson Dahl: He introduced us.
[01:53:08] Jackson Dahl: He introduced us.
[01:53:09] Jordi Hays: And he's made a number of truly incredible introductions
[01:53:15] Jordi Hays: to people that we never would have reached.
[01:53:18] Jordi Hays: I think also, just Will has a particular way
[01:53:23] John Coogan: in expressing his belief and just positivity
[01:53:28] John Coogan: and cheering for you in a very quantitative,
[01:53:34] John Coogan: like hyperbolic way.
[01:53:36] John Coogan: And so probably for the first six months,
[01:53:39] John Coogan: every time we would text with him
[01:53:42] John Coogan: just about some mundane decision we were making,
[01:53:45] John Coogan: he was like, yeah, that's great.
[01:53:47] John Coogan: I just told, and he would drop the name of some tier one fund.
[01:53:50] John Coogan: He's just like, I just told them
[01:53:51] John Coogan: that we're over subscribed at 400 posts.
[01:53:54] John Coogan: And it's like, we weren't fundraising.
[01:53:55] John Coogan: We were doing anything like that.
[01:53:56] John Coogan: But he's like, oh yeah, and so and so bought it,
[01:53:59] John Coogan: hook line and so he would say,
[01:54:01] Jordi Hays: we would just like, we have a group chat
[01:54:04] Jordi Hays: with a few other buddies.
[01:54:05] Jordi Hays: And we'd say something or something would happen.
[01:54:09] Jordi Hays: He would just post one of our own assets in the chat
[01:54:13] Jordi Hays: and he'd be like, I'm updating our like 2026 guy.
[01:54:16] Jordi Hays: The guy, yeah, he would refer to the guy.
[01:54:18] John Coogan: You think we were a public company.
[01:54:20] John Coogan: Yeah, he would also do these funny things
[01:54:23] John Coogan: just being like, yes, I've updated my thinking.
[01:54:27] John Coogan: He would use the language of like a philosophical
[01:54:30] John Coogan: venture capitalist.
[01:54:31] John Coogan: He'd be like, yes, I've updated my thinking on TbP,
[01:54:33] John Coogan: and I no longer think it will merely destroy all podcasts,
[01:54:36] John Coogan: but I think it will actually destroy all of media.
[01:54:38] John Coogan: Yes.
[01:54:39] John Coogan: We're like, what are you talking about?
[01:54:40] John Coogan: I think there's also, we have a beautiful relationship
[01:54:44] Jordi Hays: with posters, obviously.
[01:54:46] Jordi Hays: And so if you look back at all the shows,
[01:54:48] Jordi Hays: it's probably like 80% of shows have featured
[01:54:51] Jordi Hays: one of Will's posts, right?
[01:54:52] Jordi Hays: Because he's very good about kind of putting his own spin
[01:54:56] Jordi Hays: on what's happening in the world.
[01:54:58] Jordi Hays: And there's a number of people like that
[01:55:01] Jordi Hays: that I can think of, the runes of the world,
[01:55:04] Jordi Hays: the Bucco capital.
[01:55:05] Jordi Hays: And so we've curated all these amazing thinkers
[01:55:09] Jordi Hays: that are constantly putting information
[01:55:11] Jordi Hays: and takes out in the world and we're curating those
[01:55:14] Jordi Hays: and they are fundamentally like a key part of the show.
[01:55:19] Jordi Hays: And interestingly, the sports world has done a great job
[01:55:21] John Coogan: of embracing posters, like Steve Smith reacts
[01:55:24] John Coogan: to random people with hot takes about basketball or sports.
[01:55:28] John Coogan: And Pat McAfee will elevate a post about something.
[01:55:31] John Coogan: But for some reason, maybe it's just the private markets thing,
[01:55:34] John Coogan: but like business television has not, I don't know.
[01:55:38] John Coogan: I mean, I feel like it would have seen
[01:55:39] John Coogan: if Roon had ever been on Bloomberg, for example.
[01:55:42] John Coogan: Yes.
[01:55:43] John Coogan: That would be an amazing moment.
[01:55:44] John Coogan: And from my perspective, I look at a lot of our guests,
[01:55:47] John Coogan: I don't want to call them out too much,
[01:55:49] John Coogan: because maybe they'll start getting calls.
[01:55:50] John Coogan: But a lot of our guests, I'm like,
[01:55:52] John Coogan: how are they not getting called every single day?
[01:55:55] John Coogan: It's like their influence out on kids.
[01:55:56] John Coogan: But it gives me credibility.
[01:55:57] John Coogan: Yeah, and it's also just like,
[01:55:58] John Coogan: it's so many extra steps to introduce someone like a Roon
[01:56:02] John Coogan: to a Bloomberg audience on TV.
[01:56:05] John Coogan: Right?
[01:56:06] John Coogan: Whereas us, it's like, it's supernatural.
[01:56:08] John Coogan: So because we've told the story so many times
[01:56:10] John Coogan: and the show's ex-native, as you mentioned.
[01:56:13] John Coogan: And so it's a little bit easier, but it's better.
[01:56:16] John Coogan: Were there any other ideas you guys considered doing together?
[01:56:20] Jackson Dahl: Like podcast or media wise or otherwise?
[01:56:23] Jordi Hays: The first thing we worked on was kind of a drop activation
[01:56:27] Jordi Hays: for Lucy.
[01:56:28] Jordi Hays: Oh, right.
[01:56:29] Jordi Hays: And so, the idea was the original idea.
[01:56:34] Jordi Hays: And I made this whole deck on it.
[01:56:36] Jordi Hays: I sent to John was an energy drink
[01:56:39] Jordi Hays: for like white collar workers.
[01:56:41] Jordi Hays: Sort of like disposing diacode, or red roller.
[01:56:45] John Coogan: Yeah, Celsius.
[01:56:45] John Coogan: Is all of those because of different?
[01:56:47] John Coogan: Because they're obviously love,
[01:56:49] Jordi Hays: those products are loved by the laptop class.
[01:56:53] Jordi Hays: But obviously, like Celsius is not leaning into Wall Street.
[01:56:57] Jordi Hays: It's sort of like a happy accident that Wall Street has said,
[01:57:01] Jordi Hays: yeah, they've made Celsius their own.
[01:57:03] Jordi Hays: And so we kicked around the idea for a beverage company.
[01:57:08] Jordi Hays: I thought you could do a lot of this style of marketing
[01:57:11] Jordi Hays: and media that we do to support a new energy drink.
[01:57:17] Jordi Hays: We were just I think both fascinated with that category.
[01:57:20] Jordi Hays: At the same time, neither of us had any interest
[01:57:22] Jordi Hays: in creating a consumer package goods business.
[01:57:25] Jordi Hays: Like, John, I've invested.
[01:57:26] Jordi Hays: It's such a grind once you break through a zero to one.
[01:57:28] John Coogan: It's such a grind.
[01:57:29] John Coogan: You're just at a trade show, you know,
[01:57:32] 20 minutes from O'Hare in Chicago every week forever.
[01:57:38] John Coogan: Like talking to some local chain distributor.
[01:57:42] John Coogan: I got this and there's 25 other people
[01:57:43] John Coogan: with the exact same label claim.
[01:57:45] John Coogan: And they don't know you and you got to be a killer operator.
[01:57:48] John Coogan: And I think both of us recognized that neither of us
[01:57:51] John Coogan: wanted to be a CPG operator.
[01:57:53] John Coogan: Right.
[01:57:54] John Coogan: Because we both like kind of I've been in that space
[01:57:56] John Coogan: and both like tasted it and been around it.
[01:57:58] John Coogan: And so yeah, we put out like an entire campaign around it.
[01:58:01] Jordi Hays: And we put out like at least a five minute video
[01:58:04] Jordi Hays: of us riffing basically in the characters
[01:58:06] Jordi Hays: that became the original technology brothers show.
[01:58:09] Jordi Hays: So we filmed the full hour.
[01:58:11] John Coogan: We sat down and Ben was filming it over there.
[01:58:13] John Coogan: Yeah, Ben was like, did you guys grip that?
[01:58:15] Jordi Hays: He was like, what was that?
[01:58:17] Jordi Hays: And there was something there.
[01:58:18] Jordi Hays: This hilarious character, we just kind of completely melted
[01:58:21] John Coogan: into it and we were like, this is great.
[01:58:23] John Coogan: And then we also did an overlay and we made it retro.
[01:58:26] John Coogan: And we had a lot of like graphics and just like funny things.
[01:58:29] John Coogan: And we even worked with Dayjob on the packaging.
[01:58:31] Jordi Hays: And the there was like a PR box that we sent out to people
[01:58:35] Jordi Hays: that had this like comically large tin of Lucy's.
[01:58:39] Jordi Hays: It was like this big is massive, huge massive packs inside.
[01:58:43] Jordi Hays: And a Rolex that like had the branding on it.
[01:58:46] Jordi Hays: It was just like, we, I think we executed on it really well.
[01:58:49] Jordi Hays: Send it, send it to a bunch of people.
[01:58:51] Jordi Hays: But that was the first time we actually made content together.
[01:58:54] Jordi Hays: Cool.
[01:58:55] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[01:58:56] Jordi Hays: And we kind of realized and then we did two,
[01:58:58] John Coogan: I believe we did two test episodes on Riverside recorded.
[01:59:02] John Coogan: And then we started recording in person
[01:59:03] John Coogan: and we shipped the first episode that we reported.
[01:59:05] John Coogan: But in terms of formats, I was pretty convicted
[01:59:12] John Coogan: on the two person in person reaction show as a seed.
[01:59:20] John Coogan: I'd seen it in other categories.
[01:59:22] John Coogan: And it seemed like it just seemed like a very clear white space.
[01:59:26] John Coogan: And so I'd actually done some similar experiments.
[01:59:29] John Coogan: I did two test episodes with Lulu, Miservee.
[01:59:34] John Coogan: And we kind of clipped that up.
[01:59:35] John Coogan: And I saw that that was kind of interesting.
[01:59:37] John Coogan: But she was very focused on comms.
[01:59:40] John Coogan: And we weren't able to go all over the place.
[01:59:42] John Coogan: So if there wasn't a comm story that week,
[01:59:44] John Coogan: we were just like, what were we talking about?
[01:59:46] John Coogan: And then I did a test video with Jason Carmen
[01:59:49] John Coogan: that was highly cinematic.
[01:59:51] John Coogan: We were on the phone talking to each other.
[01:59:53] John Coogan: It had this weird vibe.
[01:59:54] John Coogan: And that was cool.
[01:59:55] John Coogan: But he was just very clearly making documentaries.
[01:59:57] John Coogan: And he didn't want to become a hot takes like newsman.
[02:00:03] Jordi Hays: Newsmax here.
[02:00:03] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[02:00:04] Jordi Hays: But even at a mall.
[02:00:05] Jordi Hays: And so we were just like, oh, when we put together
[02:00:07] John Coogan: the first test episode on Riverside,
[02:00:09] John Coogan: it was just super easy to talk about everything
[02:00:12] John Coogan: because we're just super calm.
[02:00:13] John Coogan: Yeah, the thing that ended up realizing, in hindsight,
[02:00:20] Jordi Hays: we both wanted to continue to be a part
[02:00:24] Jordi Hays: of the private market ecosystem, venture startups, et
[02:00:30] Jordi Hays: cetera.
[02:00:30] Jordi Hays: Like this is where we've spent our entire adult lives.
[02:00:34] Jordi Hays: This is like the thing that we spend the most amount
[02:00:37] Jordi Hays: of mental energy thinking about.
[02:00:39] Jordi Hays: But we didn't want to go and do a traditional venture
[02:00:44] Jordi Hays: backed business.
[02:00:45] Jordi Hays: We didn't want to become a venture capitalist, not because
[02:00:51] Jordi Hays: we just didn't feel like called to do those things again
[02:00:54] Jordi Hays: in that moment.
[02:00:55] Jordi Hays: And so there's not a lot of options
[02:00:57] Jordi Hays: outside of media to actually stay heavily involved
[02:01:02] Jordi Hays: without doing those two paths.
[02:01:05] Jordi Hays: And so being in LA, too, it's not a tech hub.
[02:01:09] Jordi Hays: We're LA tech week.
[02:01:11] Jordi Hays: Is this week?
[02:01:12] Jordi Hays: I haven't seen any technology out there.
[02:01:14] Jordi Hays: I didn't even know.
[02:01:15] Jordi Hays: It's like a terrible tech hub, because it's
[02:01:18] Jordi Hays: like basically a string of neighborhoods
[02:01:21] Jordi Hays: that are loosely connected by freeways.
[02:01:24] Jordi Hays: And there's a couple companies that are somewhat important.
[02:01:27] Jordi Hays: But it's certainly not a, and we have El Segundo now,
[02:01:31] Jordi Hays: which is its own amazing thing.
[02:01:34] Jordi Hays: But the idea of building a tech company in LA
[02:01:39] Jordi Hays: is joke to me.
[02:01:42] Jordi Hays: It's just not something that you really,
[02:01:45] Jordi Hays: I'm sure you can do it.
[02:01:46] Jordi Hays: But again, ignoring El Segundo, because that's its own thing.
[02:01:51] Jordi Hays: And so we were in a position where we both have kids.
[02:01:56] Jordi Hays: We have John Hesterriev 2, all under five.
[02:01:59] Jordi Hays: They're set up in their communities.
[02:02:01] Jordi Hays: We had no desire to.
[02:02:03] Jordi Hays: I really felt like if I wanted to build another company,
[02:02:05] Jordi Hays: I had to move to San Francisco or New York.
[02:02:10] Jordi Hays: And I didn't necessarily want to do that.
[02:02:13] Jordi Hays: I like LA County, right?
[02:02:16] Jordi Hays: I love where I live.
[02:02:17] Jordi Hays: And so media was the perfect business
[02:02:20] Jordi Hays: to start and stay involved with the world that we love
[02:02:24] Jordi Hays: and get to talk all day long with our friends,
[02:02:28] Jordi Hays: like you that are in and around the industry,
[02:02:32] Jordi Hays: while building a business that is extremely well suited
[02:02:35] Jordi Hays: to build in Hollywood and build in LA.
[02:02:36] Jordi Hays: And to you guys.
[02:02:37] Jordi Hays: Because we are not looking to hire.
[02:02:39] Jordi Hays: We're not looking to hire 50 engineers in the next two years.
[02:02:45] Jordi Hays: We're looking to hire.
[02:02:47] Jordi Hays: And we're actually not even really.
[02:02:49] Jordi Hays: We're hiring for a couple of roles now.
[02:02:50] Jordi Hays: But it's like, where is the best place in the world
[02:02:54] Jordi Hays: to build a media and entertainment company?
[02:02:55] Jordi Hays: It's like LA, right?
[02:02:57] Jackson Dahl: I mentioned before I interviewed Gabe Waley for Mr.
[02:03:00] Jackson Dahl: recently and he brought up Soilent.
[02:03:03] Jackson Dahl: There's an excerpt in the mischief, like employee guideline
[02:03:06] Jackson Dahl: handbook where it says, Soilent could have been a speculative
[02:03:08] Jackson Dahl: artwork instead.
[02:03:09] Jackson Dahl: It's real.
[02:03:10] Jackson Dahl: And then Gabe went on to say, you could have done it
[02:03:12] Jackson Dahl: as a small batch or an artist could have lived off it
[02:03:14] Jackson Dahl: as a performance for 20 years, documented everything,
[02:03:16] Jackson Dahl: had a video, and then done a gallery show about it,
[02:03:18] Jackson Dahl: living off the powder.
[02:03:19] Jackson Dahl: Instead, it was a business.
[02:03:20] Jackson Dahl: It was a company.
[02:03:21] Jackson Dahl: They put it out into the real world.
[02:03:23] Jackson Dahl: And that's rad.
[02:03:23] Jackson Dahl: That's cool.
[02:03:25] Jackson Dahl: Obviously that partially applies to you.
[02:03:27] Jackson Dahl: But I think it captures this earnest, just try stuff.
[02:03:32] Jackson Dahl: I mean, even what you were describing of getting to this,
[02:03:34] Jackson Dahl: and a whole lot of iterations, cycles that people didn't see,
[02:03:37] Jackson Dahl: that were real things.
[02:03:39] Jackson Dahl: I'm curious what goes into your guys' inclinations
[02:03:42] Jackson Dahl: to just like, that's an interesting idea.
[02:03:45] Jackson Dahl: Let's see if it, let's put into reality and see if it works.
[02:03:48] Jackson Dahl: I think there's seeds in humor, because humor gives you
[02:03:53] John Coogan: the permission to do something low status.
[02:03:58] John Coogan: I mean, even the soil and thing, it was definitely
[02:04:01] John Coogan: like a social experiment.
[02:04:03] John Coogan: We didn't even know if it was just a complete joke
[02:04:05] John Coogan: the whole time.
[02:04:06] John Coogan: But then it went viral, and people wanted to buy it.
[02:04:09] John Coogan: But as a YC company, starting like a consumer package
[02:04:12] John Coogan: of goods company, it was extremely low status.
[02:04:14] John Coogan: Awesome.
[02:04:14] John Coogan: You wanted to.
[02:04:15] John Coogan: The literal name.
[02:04:15] John Coogan: Yeah, crazy, right?
[02:04:17] John Coogan: So everything was like Polish and sane.
[02:04:19] John Coogan: So there were a variety of like, just when you start with some,
[02:04:26] John Coogan: with you start with the lens of like humor or performance art,
[02:04:30] John Coogan: it gives you the ability to broaden the aperture
[02:04:34] John Coogan: to like get really weird.
[02:04:35] John Coogan: And then this started as something really weird,
[02:04:38] John Coogan: like just two guys reading the newspaper,
[02:04:40] John Coogan: which isn't really a thing, and that's not really a show.
[02:04:42] John Coogan: And now we've kind of shaped it into something
[02:04:44] John Coogan: that does look like a real news product,
[02:04:46] John Coogan: and a real like media product.
[02:04:49] John Coogan: But it allows you to kind of start from scratch.
[02:04:52] John Coogan: Yes.
[02:04:52] John Coogan: A really blank canvas, as opposed to being like,
[02:04:54] John Coogan: this is what a podcast is, or this is what a show is,
[02:04:57] John Coogan: and then I have to like, I have to take what is already a thing,
[02:05:00] John Coogan: and then like try and find a little bit of differentiation.
[02:05:03] John Coogan: Instead, you just start from like,
[02:05:04] John Coogan: or we go around the world.
[02:05:05] John Coogan: Yeah, the other thing that is very real is,
[02:05:08] Jordi Hays: I think we both like creating things,
[02:05:10] Jordi Hays: very John created Soylin, and then Lucy,
[02:05:13] Jordi Hays: I going back to like my very first company,
[02:05:16] Jordi Hays: I created a skateboard company when I was 12,
[02:05:18] Jordi Hays: and that was like, realizing that there were people out there
[02:05:21] Jordi Hays: that would manufacture skateboards,
[02:05:23] Jordi Hays: and if I created a logo and gave them that logo,
[02:05:26] Jordi Hays: and I gave them the artwork that I could, as a 12-year-old,
[02:05:29] Jordi Hays: I like, call that my aunt, I was like, I need $500,
[02:05:32] Jordi Hays: that's like, the boards were like,
[02:05:34] Jordi Hays: $17.50 to make, and I was like,
[02:05:37] Jordi Hays: I'm going to buy these, and then I'm going to sell them locally,
[02:05:40] Jordi Hays: and stores, and at the skate park,
[02:05:42] Jordi Hays: and to my friends' parents, who would then give them
[02:05:45] Jordi Hays: to their kids for birthdays, right?
[02:05:47] Jordi Hays: It was just that realization that you could make things
[02:05:49] Jordi Hays: that happened at a young age,
[02:05:51] Jordi Hays: the thing about making things like,
[02:05:53] Jordi Hays: in the physical world, and even software,
[02:05:55] Jordi Hays: and companies is like, the feedback loop is just so,
[02:05:58] Jordi Hays: it takes so much time, right?
[02:06:00] Jordi Hays: So like an example, I started a company
[02:06:03] Jordi Hays: with my partner's Brian and Charlie years ago, at this point,
[02:06:07] Jordi Hays: which was a consumer water filter business,
[02:06:11] Jordi Hays: and like, from the time that we were like,
[02:06:13] Jordi Hays: hey, let's do this, and like, from the seed of the idea
[02:06:16] Jordi Hays: to actually forming the company,
[02:06:19] Jordi Hays: to raising money, to developing the product,
[02:06:23] Jordi Hays: to developing the brand, to now fast forward to today,
[02:06:26] Jordi Hays: where we launched the partnership with Andrew Huberman,
[02:06:29] Jordi Hays: like, I was years in the making, right?
[02:06:31] Jordi Hays: And so, if you enjoy making things,
[02:06:34] Jordi Hays: there's nothing better than content to me,
[02:06:36] Jordi Hays: because we can have an idea at breakfast,
[02:06:39] Jordi Hays: and ship it two hours later,
[02:06:40] Jordi Hays: so that iteration is just super addictive,
[02:06:43] Jordi Hays: where if you like generating ideas,
[02:06:46] Jordi Hays: and you think you have decent ideas,
[02:06:48] Jordi Hays: and you want to see like, the challenge with startups
[02:06:50] Jordi Hays: is like, I've seen this, it's like, you know,
[02:06:53] Jordi Hays: I'll meet an entrepreneur, and I'm like, okay,
[02:06:54] Jordi Hays: you have a good idea, you don't know if it's actually,
[02:06:56] Jordi Hays: like, truly a good idea.
[02:06:58] Jordi Hays: See, and 12-day-d-months.
[02:06:59] John Coogan: Yeah, even more, like, I've had companies
[02:07:02] Jordi Hays: that I thought were literally dead,
[02:07:05] Jordi Hays: because they weren't sending updates,
[02:07:06] Jordi Hays: and then they send an update, and it's like,
[02:07:08] Jordi Hays: yeah, we just crossed a million dollars a month
[02:07:10] Jordi Hays: in revenue, and like, it's working, finally,
[02:07:12] Jordi Hays: and so, the thing that's so addictive about media
[02:07:15] Jordi Hays: is just, again, that like, we love generating ideas,
[02:07:19] Jordi Hays: and you can sometimes it takes like,
[02:07:22] Jordi Hays: three hours to make, sometimes it takes 20 minutes to make,
[02:07:25] Jordi Hays: et cetera.
[02:07:26] Jordi Hays: I'm laughing because we're talking about how addictive media is,
[02:07:28] John Coogan: and I think we're on the fifth hour of podcasting.
[02:07:31] John Coogan: We sat down on my hair, you guys sure you're ready to do this,
[02:07:33] Jackson Dahl: and they're like, we can podcast literally.
[02:07:35] Jackson Dahl: We are almost out of time, I would love to just do a quick
[02:07:38] Jackson Dahl: speed round of a few miscellaneous things,
[02:07:40] Jackson Dahl: if you guys are off course.
[02:07:42] Jackson Dahl: How do you do a great 15-minute interview?
[02:07:46] Got to ring a gong, a big one, ideally.
[02:07:48] John Coogan: Yeah, fair.
[02:07:49] John Coogan: We don't do life stories, you know,
[02:07:51] Jordi Hays: this is not a place where you're gonna learn everything
[02:07:54] Jordi Hays: there is to know about people,
[02:07:56] Jordi Hays: like, it takes some amount of context.
[02:07:58] Jordi Hays: Most people also...
[02:07:59] Jordi Hays: They can still squish that every meeting that they had
[02:08:01] John Coogan: with entrepreneurs in 15 minutes, right?
[02:08:03] John Coogan: And we just have the affordance to be like,
[02:08:05] John Coogan: it's 15 minutes.
[02:08:06] John Coogan: Yeah, they're just like, intro, what do you do?
[02:08:09] John Coogan: And then the news, it gotta be news driven,
[02:08:12] John Coogan: so we ring the gong or talk about the product announcement,
[02:08:14] John Coogan: and then pretty quickly, it's like, give us,
[02:08:16] John Coogan: get us just one layer deeper, not a sound,
[02:08:19] John Coogan: but I don't even think about that.
[02:08:20] John Coogan: I think about it like, take me one layer deeper
[02:08:23] John Coogan: in understanding your business, your market,
[02:08:26] John Coogan: because if you come on in here,
[02:08:28] John Coogan: we had somebody on who was building AI
[02:08:30] John Coogan: for ambulance chasers, what was that?
[02:08:32] John Coogan: It was personal injury attorneys.
[02:08:34] John Coogan: And I was like, I don't really know anything
[02:08:36] John Coogan: about the personal injury market.
[02:08:37] John Coogan: I'll just ask one question to get me up
[02:08:40] John Coogan: like a little bit more information on how that market works.
[02:08:43] John Coogan: So then maybe I'd come out of an interview
[02:08:45] John Coogan: just understanding how many personal injury
[02:08:47] John Coogan: attorney firms are there.
[02:08:48] John Coogan: What's the average size?
[02:08:49] John Coogan: Well, so I'd say the reason that if we do a 15 minute interview,
[02:08:54] Jordi Hays: a 15 minute interview, the reason that it's great
[02:08:56] Jordi Hays: is probably that historically it would have been
[02:08:58] Jordi Hays: a 90 minute interview, and that was way too much time
[02:09:03] Jordi Hays: for that person at that point in their career,
[02:09:05] Jordi Hays: that moment, right?
[02:09:06] Jordi Hays: And so we just recognize it's much more interesting
[02:09:10] Jordi Hays: to hear for 10 minutes from somebody
[02:09:14] Jordi Hays: like in a specific moment in time than 90 minutes, right?
[02:09:20] Jordi Hays: Like a lot of, we talk to a lot of like seed series A,
[02:09:23] Jordi Hays: series B founders that are just kind of like starting
[02:09:25] Jordi Hays: their journeys.
[02:09:26] Jordi Hays: And someday they might be like an Alex Carp
[02:09:28] Jordi Hays: or a Palmer lucky year or Mark Andreessen
[02:09:30] Jordi Hays: and that they can just talk and talk and talk
[02:09:33] Jordi Hays: and it's entertaining, but they're not at that point yet.
[02:09:37] Jordi Hays: And so like let's give them the format where they can come in
[02:09:39] Jordi Hays: and introduce themselves to the world.
[02:09:41] Jordi Hays: And we get to hear how they're thinking in that moment.
[02:09:44] Jordi Hays: The other thing when we do like at Meta Connect
[02:09:47] Jordi Hays: and at YC Demo Day, we think it's a very interesting media
[02:09:51] Jordi Hays: product to interview like an entire management team in three
[02:09:55] Jordi Hays: hours because you're getting to hear how all those people
[02:09:58] Jordi Hays: are thinking not generally, not over,
[02:10:01] Jordi Hays: like you could piece together interviews
[02:10:03] Jordi Hays: from an executive team over a quarter, right?
[02:10:06] Jordi Hays: But it's not all like in that one moment
[02:10:08] Jordi Hays: where they're launching this new product or our Demo Day
[02:10:11] Jordi Hays: content with YC, it's like you get a really good sense
[02:10:14] Jordi Hays: of the batch from listening to a bunch of three minute
[02:10:17] Jordi Hays: interviews, right?
[02:10:18] Jordi Hays: You get a good read much more than just kind of like reading
[02:10:21] Jordi Hays: through what you talk for 45 minutes about all of them even.
[02:10:23] Jackson Dahl: Yeah, you're getting like real.
[02:10:25] Jordi Hays: Yes, that's cool.
[02:10:26] Jackson Dahl: Yeah, you're getting like a flash pulse check
[02:10:28] Jackson Dahl: with a bunch of different flavors.
[02:10:30] Jackson Dahl: What's the difference between what is the conscious difference
[02:10:35] Jackson Dahl: between what you guys do in journalism?
[02:10:38] We don't break news.
[02:10:40] Yeah, we rarely break news.
[02:10:42] John Coogan: We're very happy for the news to break it 9 a.m. on
[02:10:46] John Coogan: tech Twitter acts like it normally does.
[02:10:49] John Coogan: You can ask if I raise, come on and give us more context.
[02:10:51] John Coogan: Yeah.
[02:10:52] John Coogan: Let's react to the reaction.
[02:10:53] John Coogan: How are people perceiving it?
[02:10:54] John Coogan: You're launching video, got 10,000 likes, got a lot of hate.
[02:10:58] John Coogan: Let's talk about why.
[02:10:59] John Coogan: Right.
[02:10:59] John Coogan: What are you going to say?
[02:11:00] John Coogan: Yeah, we could break news, but it puts us at a very adversarial
[02:11:04] Jordi Hays: position because we like that in general.
[02:11:08] Jordi Hays: Like we think it's good and healthy that like founders are generally
[02:11:11] Jordi Hays: able to control their own narratives and decide when news should
[02:11:16] Jordi Hays: break.
[02:11:17] Jordi Hays: Like we've both been in positions where a journalist is breaking a
[02:11:20] Jordi Hays: story or telling you this news is going out in an hour.
[02:11:26] Jordi Hays: Let me know if you have a comment.
[02:11:27] Jordi Hays: And I think that there's a lot of value to fact finding and
[02:11:32] Jordi Hays: like original reporting and their stories that do need to be
[02:11:34] Jordi Hays: told told.
[02:11:36] Jordi Hays: And there's certainly stories that don't want to be told that
[02:11:38] Jordi Hays: still need to be told.
[02:11:39] Jordi Hays: But we think that it's important for our position kind of in the
[02:11:43] Jordi Hays: ecosystem to not be like we have no interest in scooping.
[02:11:47] Jordi Hays: I have no interest in telling a story and being the one.
[02:11:50] Jordi Hays: Yeah, being the one to deliver a story that doesn't want to be
[02:11:53] Jordi Hays: delivered.
[02:11:54] John Coogan: There's a commentary.
[02:11:55] John Coogan: And there's shams and there's Stephen.
[02:11:56] John Coogan: Exactly.
[02:11:57] John Coogan: Yeah.
[02:11:58] John Coogan: And there's also like the newswire for like the sports scores,
[02:12:01] John Coogan: which used to be printed and now it's digital.
[02:12:03] John Coogan: And so all these different pieces have moved around to different
[02:12:06] John Coogan: sections of the ecosystem.
[02:12:08] John Coogan: But you just got to like know your lane and thrive in it.
[02:12:11] John Coogan: Yeah.
[02:12:12] Jordi Hays: And an example being CNBC is not in the scoop business, right?
[02:12:17] Jordi Hays: They're not like transfer general is.
[02:12:20] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[02:12:21] John Coogan: You teach your driver really what to expect from you.
[02:12:23] Jackson Dahl: Exactly.
[02:12:25] Jackson Dahl: What you you had about your interns here.
[02:12:28] Jackson Dahl: I'll pick on Tyler's that general example.
[02:12:31] Jackson Dahl: But maybe him specifically someone who is Tyler's also the only
[02:12:35] Jordi Hays: intern only remaining.
[02:12:36] Jackson Dahl: And he's not really an intern.
[02:12:37] Jackson Dahl: Right.
[02:12:38] Jackson Dahl: So somebody like that who is generally smart and capable and
[02:12:43] Jackson Dahl: could probably do a lot of things in tech that are not media.
[02:12:49] Jackson Dahl: Why does someone like that stick around here for another year or
[02:12:53] Jackson Dahl: five?
[02:12:54] Jackson Dahl: Let's go ask him bring him over.
[02:12:57] Jordi Hays: Tyler will have I can imagine a bunch of different paths for
[02:13:02] Jordi Hays: Tyler.
[02:13:02] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[02:13:03] Jordi Hays: After post DBPN.
[02:13:04] Jordi Hays: I can imagine a world where he stays with us for 30 years and
[02:13:06] Jordi Hays: it's just personality on the show.
[02:13:08] Jordi Hays: And it's it's an incredible personality to bring to the show.
[02:13:10] Jordi Hays: Because like he has more time than we do.
[02:13:12] Jordi Hays: He can go out and like nerd out about something, come back.
[02:13:14] Jordi Hays: Different interests.
[02:13:15] Jordi Hays: Yeah, different different set of interests.
[02:13:17] Jordi Hays: Or he's bringing something novel to the show.
[02:13:19] Jordi Hays: But yeah, I mean, Tyler is unique in that he's the, you know,
[02:13:24] Jordi Hays: reoccurring like personality on the show.
[02:13:26] Jordi Hays: But if you think about what his optionality will be after, you know,
[02:13:30] Jordi Hays: if he decides at some point in the future, one, he's still in college,
[02:13:33] Jordi Hays: hasn't officially dropped out.
[02:13:35] Jordi Hays: He's on a gap semester.
[02:13:36] Jordi Hays: But if he decides to go back to school and still be a part of what we're
[02:13:41] Jordi Hays: doing or just like go back to school and just be a student or stay with us.
[02:13:45] Jordi Hays: And then a year from now, you know, decide, I want to start a company.
[02:13:48] Jordi Hays: I want to start, you know, I want to go work at a venture firm, right?
[02:13:53] Jordi Hays: Like he's going to have like truly infinite.
[02:13:56] Jordi Hays: Or one of the thousand companies we interview this year that we can easily make an intro to.
[02:14:01] John Coogan: Yeah.
[02:14:02] One more thing that I would add, like, like talent retention to put it in like corporate
[02:14:10] Jordi Hays: speak.
[02:14:11] Jordi Hays: Yeah.
[02:14:12] Jordi Hays: Like we want, we want to create an environment where the people that are out
[02:14:19] Jordi Hays: of the company today are riding with us like across like decades.
[02:14:24] Jordi Hays: And certainly people will go off and do other things.
[02:14:26] Jordi Hays: But, you know, to date, we haven't had somebody like, like, decide to leave themselves.
[02:14:33] Jordi Hays: And part, we're like hyper conscious of like creating ways so that people can grow
[02:14:40] Jordi Hays: in the industry because there's not like, if you, if you're, if you're deciding to work
[02:14:44] Jordi Hays: in tech media, like, I don't know that many other places.
[02:14:49] Jordi Hays: That you can go that are going to be fulfilling after you work in like this type of environment.
[02:14:53] Jordi Hays: Right?
[02:14:54] Jordi Hays: You might decide.
[02:14:55] Jordi Hays: I see it much more like a, like a law firm's partnership than a C-Corp that is growing
[02:15:02] John Coogan: and changing and cycling people through.
[02:15:05] John Coogan: It's like the people who get in, develop the unique sort of skills that work very tightly
[02:15:09] John Coogan: together.
[02:15:10] John Coogan: It's a small group for a very long time and everyone participates in the upside for a long
[02:15:15] John Coogan: time.
[02:15:16] John Coogan: That's definitely rare in media.
[02:15:18] Jackson Dahl: Yeah, as opposed to like, you know, the, hey, we're all going to be on a four year vest
[02:15:22] John Coogan: and then we're going to get out and sell this thing and then we're all going to be on
[02:15:24] John Coogan: this.
[02:15:25] John Coogan: But also like content creators.
[02:15:26] Jackson Dahl: Like, people don't, it's pretty rare for like, there to be real durability or
[02:15:30] Jackson Dahl: aspect of that.
[02:15:31] Jackson Dahl: Yeah, I think it's that we have like a pretty clear vision into what like the show looks
[02:15:35] John Coogan: like in 30 years.
[02:15:36] John Coogan: And it's not vice news where you have a bunch of other people doing other shows.
[02:15:40] John Coogan: Like we're not building a media company, a platform with a bunch of other things where
[02:15:44] John Coogan: it's like, oh yeah, thank goodness.
[02:15:46] John Coogan: We don't have to podcast today because we hire hosts.
[02:15:48] John Coogan: Right.
[02:15:49] John Coogan: It's like, no, we're building a show.
[02:15:50] John Coogan: And so you can look at what Rogan's organization looks like and Heurimins organization looks
[02:15:55] John Coogan: like and you can see that you can be doing a hundred million dollars a year top line
[02:15:59] John Coogan: with a team of 10.
[02:16:01] John Coogan: And so why not just do that?
[02:16:03] You, I think you guys have talked about the sort of like, maybe as you, John, like the
[02:16:06] Jackson Dahl: sort of speculation culture, the feeling that it's stupid to not use leverage.
[02:16:10] Jackson Dahl: You have to, you have two years to escape the permanent underposs.
[02:16:12] Jackson Dahl: Perfect.
[02:16:13] Jackson Dahl: Yeah, what would you say to young people who are feeling that?
[02:16:17] I think it's a very toxic mindset.
[02:16:20] Jordi Hays: Or if you guys were 21, you were trying to, I mean, it just game theoretically.
[02:16:24] John Coogan: It's clearly there's immense alpha in not participating in that culture, right?
[02:16:29] John Coogan: Because if everyone else in your college class is participating, get your bad culture,
[02:16:34] John Coogan: get rich, quick schemes and they're hustling and they're flexing and you're just compounding,
[02:16:39] John Coogan: like you're going to win.
[02:16:40] John Coogan: And it's going to be even less competitive because you're actually.
[02:16:43] John Coogan: It's also like the advice that we give, the financial advice that we give to the team.
[02:16:49] Jordi Hays: And I'm saying that in sort of a joking way.
[02:16:52] Jordi Hays: But it is financial advice is to like, if you were in your 20s, trying and you have like
[02:16:59] Jordi Hays: relatively modest cash flow, trying to yolo into investments in order to escape the permanent
[02:17:06] Jordi Hays: underclass is like such a ridiculous concept because when you're not deploying size, like
[02:17:12] Jordi Hays: two is going to distract you from the main thing that's important, which is like the
[02:17:16] Jordi Hays: value thing.
[02:17:17] Jackson Dahl: I think the fear is what else could be made.
[02:17:18] Jackson Dahl: Like, are there even any main things left?
[02:17:20] John Coogan: There's tons of main things left, obviously.
[02:17:23] Like the power laws get steeper all over the place, just be at the top end of the power
[02:17:28] John Coogan: law.
[02:17:29] And maybe to go back to what we were talking about earlier, look at more diverse set of inputs
[02:17:35] Jackson Dahl: of like what creativity is going to come from.
[02:17:38] Jackson Dahl: Yeah, don't fall into the status traps because I guarantee you that like the best pot
[02:17:42] John Coogan: of remaker in the world is going to be pulling seven figures.
[02:17:45] John Coogan: If they're a, you know, that's by ceramicist, right?
[02:17:49] John Coogan: I think about that.
[02:17:50] John Coogan: I think about this so much because when I was in college, I like was obsessed with startups.
[02:17:55] Jordi Hays: I would be refreshing tech crunch, right?
[02:17:57] Jordi Hays: I'd be on tech Twitter at the time.
[02:17:59] Jordi Hays: Like, I was so like obsessed with venture capital.
[02:18:05] Jordi Hays: And yet my first real business was a company that didn't raise money that just grew profitably
[02:18:11] Jordi Hays: and has continued to grow profitably for my entire adult life.
[02:18:15] Jordi Hays: And that is the entire reason that I was able to just decide we were able to be like,
[02:18:19] Jordi Hays: okay, we can just, John was an EIR, Founders Fund.
[02:18:22] Jordi Hays: I didn't have anything else that I needed to do with my time.
[02:18:25] Jordi Hays: I had had, and so it's like, you want to not like, and it was being really into startups
[02:18:32] Jordi Hays: and having a lifestyle business.
[02:18:34] Jordi Hays: It was at times like kind of miserable because I'd be sitting there being like, like,
[02:18:39] Jordi Hays: I'm making like real cash flow here.
[02:18:42] Jordi Hays: And nobody is going to look at my LinkedIn and like, awesome.
[02:18:46] Jordi Hays: I feel like I'm in the big leagues.
[02:18:47] Jordi Hays: Yeah, I wasn't, you didn't feel like I was in the league at all, right?
[02:18:49] Jordi Hays: It's like, no one, if you have a lifestyle business, like, get ready to make like a lot of money,
[02:18:54] Jordi Hays: but like, no one is going to care about you at all, right?
[02:18:58] Jordi Hays: Because you're not providing a way for other people to, you're not, you might be providing value
[02:19:04] Jordi Hays: to like a set of customers, but you're not like giving people an opportunity to make money.
[02:19:08] Jordi Hays: Like if you're raising a bit of capital.
[02:19:10] Jordi Hays: And so I think that's like somewhat of a,
[02:19:12] Jordi Hays: Yeah, it's really sad, right?
[02:19:15] Jordi Hays: Like, if you're just chugging away building a business, like, no one cares.
[02:19:19] Jordi Hays: Like, do you have a central care in 50 years to build a lifestyle?
[02:19:23] John Coogan: By the way, it takes a long time.
[02:19:25] John Coogan: It takes a long time for you to get recognition.
[02:19:27] John Coogan: How have the wives of TBPN influenced or made this thing better?
[02:19:33] Honestly,
[02:19:35] Jackson Dahl: I think we focus on like building something like in person was like a no brainer, for sure.
[02:19:40] John Coogan: We want to be home with the families and whatnot.
[02:19:42] John Coogan: And so this idea of like, oh, we're on the road all the time.
[02:19:45] John Coogan: It just raises the quality bar for like, yeah, we'll travel for Mark Zuckerberg.
[02:19:49] John Coogan: But are we going to travel for some random thing just because it's like fun or trendy or like,
[02:19:54] John Coogan: there's one percent chance that it's good.
[02:19:57] John Coogan: It's like really, really focused and just continue to raise the bar.
[02:20:00] John Coogan: I think they're both incredible mothers, which means that we get to spend, you know,
[02:20:07] Jordi Hays: we both wake up before the kids.
[02:20:10] Jordi Hays: We're at the office before the kid, or we're like meeting up, like, starting the work day,
[02:20:14] Jordi Hays: before the kids are even up.
[02:20:15] Jordi Hays: And then they are, like, such incredible moms that like, we get to go home after the
[02:20:23] Jordi Hays: show and like, the kids are happy, they're thriving.
[02:20:27] Jordi Hays: We just get to hang out.
[02:20:28] Jordi Hays: And they're carrying the burden of like, the household and like, running that and having
[02:20:34] Jordi Hays: the ability to be like, live on the air for three hours and not be thinking like, yeah,
[02:20:40] Jordi Hays: we're doing, are the kids like eating lunch or like, you know, that we're not thinking about.
[02:20:44] Jordi Hays: Yeah, and we've had to like, pull the stream because of family stuff was literally during
[02:20:48] John Coogan: the L.A. fires.
[02:20:50] John Coogan: And that was like completely reasonable to be like, get home.
[02:20:53] John Coogan: But other than that, I mean, yeah, it's been fantastic.
[02:20:56] John Coogan: My final question.
[02:20:58] Jackson Dahl: I'm not sure who this quote actually should be attributed to.
[02:21:00] Jackson Dahl: I think it's either you or, or will, but podcasting has little to do with profit.
[02:21:06] Jackson Dahl: Podcasting is about domination of the spirit.
[02:21:09] We heard it that.
[02:21:10] John Coogan: So, so that is a, it might be a sin ref.
[02:21:12] Jackson Dahl: So, so, so someone else said that in business.
[02:21:15] John Coogan: Okay.
[02:21:16] John Coogan: And I think it was, business has little to do with profit.
[02:21:20] John Coogan: Businesses about domination and spirit.
[02:21:22] John Coogan: And then we, and then I was, I think I said it at one point, you just used it in a job
[02:21:27] John Coogan: post.
[02:21:28] John Coogan: Yeah, no, I know.
[02:21:29] John Coogan: I think I used it in a, in a group chat and then we'll post it publicly.
[02:21:34] John Coogan: And it will apply to me.
[02:21:36] John Coogan: And then that reminded me.
[02:21:37] John Coogan: And so I posted it in the job post.
[02:21:39] John Coogan: Okay.
[02:21:40] John Coogan: But yes, I mean, one of the things was that, you know, we take podcasting really seriously.
[02:21:44] John Coogan: We don't see it.
[02:21:45] John Coogan: We don't care about the status.
[02:21:46] John Coogan: Maybe it's low status.
[02:21:47] John Coogan: Maybe it's high status, whatever.
[02:21:48] John Coogan: Like we're doing it.
[02:21:49] John Coogan: We're all in.
[02:21:50] John Coogan: We're going very hard on it.
[02:21:51] John Coogan: But just to take the ad job a little bit, we throw in a little bit of humor.
[02:21:55] John Coogan: But we do kind of feel that.
[02:21:57] John Coogan: And my question is going to be how are you?
[02:21:59] John Coogan: A better line is David Sennra.
[02:22:02] Jordi Hays: We were hanging out and he goes like, I wish media was the zero sum game.
[02:22:06] Jordi Hays: He's like, I mad that it's, you know, I mad that it, that, that like I can, I can win.
[02:22:12] Jordi Hays: And someone else can win.
[02:22:13] Jordi Hays: Even though I'm so brutally competitive.
[02:22:15] John Coogan: And he's like, I wish he was more competitive.
[02:22:16] John Coogan: I love it.
[02:22:17] John Coogan: It's amazing.
[02:22:18] Gentlemen, thank you very much.
[02:22:19] Jackson Dahl: Thanks, Chris.
[02:22:20] John Coogan: Super fun.
[02:22:21] John Coogan: This was great.
[02:22:22] Jordi Hays: Good times.
[02:22:23] Thank you.
