# Podcast Summary: John Coogan & Jordy Hayes (TBPN) on Dialectic

## 1. Key Themes

### Theme 1: Building Media as a Craft - Daily Iteration Compounds Into Excellence
The show's success stems from treating daily live broadcasting as an iterative product development cycle, not a creative performance.

**Substantiation:**
"A baker gets to show up every day, they make bread, but every single day they can change tiny little things, they can change the temperature, what if you change the amount of yeast, what if you change the amount of flour? When we think about making the show every single day, we know when the product is great, we feel it. We end the show every day and we're talking through, okay, this section could have been better, that story... that interview was really slow. We got to like adjust the schedule for tomorrow to make sure that doesn't happen again. And so every single day is an opportunity to make the product better." - Jordy Hayes [[00:18:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=18m10s)

"If you look at just one shot of the show every single day over the last year, you would see very clearly there's like minor iterations happening every single day. And every single day we've learned something new about the show and how to make it better. And I think we'll do that for a very, very, very long time." - Jordy Hayes [[00:19:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=19m18s)

### Theme 2: Advertising Over Subscriptions Creates True Distribution Freedom
They deliberately chose advertising as their business model to keep content free and avoid creating paywalls that limit distribution and cultural impact.

**Substantiation:**
"There's roughly 15 or so companies that have like effectively financed TBPN so that it's free for the entire world, right? And I actually think that's a beautiful, beautiful thing. I think where advertising gets a bad rap is non-targeted advertising... and high ad loads. We have a higher volume of ads than the average podcast, but we actually have a much lower percentage of the actual content is advertising, right?" - Jordy Hayes [[00:38:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=37m53s)

"Price discrimination. There are people that follow the show that are billionaires. There are people that follow the show that are in college. And so if you find a great product where that company can get both of those people as a client and extract literally one billion dollars from the multi-billionaire who runs a massive company... and then also help the college students start their first company and extract maybe 200 bucks a month once they get into YC... that's only possible with advertising." - John Coogan [[00:36:21]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=36m11s)

### Theme 3: Ruthless Focus on One Show Beats Building a Media Empire
Rejecting the traditional media company playbook of building a network, they're committed to being the talent indefinitely rather than scaling through delegation.

**Substantiation:**
"You have a pretty clear vision into what like the show looks like in 30 years. And it's not vice news where you have a bunch of other people doing other shows. Like we're not building a media company, a platform with a bunch of other things where it's like, oh yeah, thank goodness. We don't have to podcast today, but we hired hosts... You can look at what Rogan's organization looks like and Huberman's organization looks like. And you can see that you can be doing a hundred million dollars a year top line with a team of 10. So why not just do that?" - John Coogan [[00:56:53]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=56m43s)

"Every time somebody does that [starts side projects], they then are in competition with somebody who doesn't have the other [distractions]... If you were trying to make a media business and you're competing in a market where there are a bunch of people that want your audience, they want the attention that you have, and they don't have a venture fund, and then you go and you're a media creator and you start a venture fund. It's like, well, who's your customer now? Is it your LPs? Is it the founders? Is it your audience?" - Jordy Hayes [[00:42:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=41m53s)

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### Perspective 1: Tech Copies from Within Tech When It Should Steal from Other Industries
Most tech companies and media look to each other for inspiration, creating derivative products, when the real alpha comes from importing ideas from completely different industries.

**Substantiation:**
"I think technology is too inspired by technology. If you think about, best example of this is like the browser company, right? The whole way to name a company and they were able, like, that was just the naming of that company was valuable because it stood out... And since then, over the years, we've seen like probably a hundred companies created with that [naming convention]... And it pains me every single time because the, the, one of the things that people in tech do is they just copy from within the industry." - Jordy Hayes [[00:45:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=44m55s)

"Great artist steel from elsewhere, right? They're not like, oh, this great artist did something. I want to be a great artist. So I'm going to do a guard exactly like copy of the Mona Lisa... So I think what we've done well, I did this historically with everything that I worked on is like, it's great to copy. It's great to get heavily inspired, but do it not for the category and the industry that you're competing in with the original person." - Jordy Hayes [[00:45:37]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=45m27s)

### Perspective 2: Low Status Can Be a Deliberate Competitive Advantage
They intentionally leaned into making TBPN even more low-status than podcasting already was by doing things like host-read ads before having sponsors and daily live shows.

**Substantiation:**
"Our decision, our key decision was making it even more low status. So we made it. How can you go low? How can you be more low status than a podcaster? Be a low status than a tech podcaster. You can be a tech podcaster who also runs host read ads constantly. That's incredibly low status... We did ads before we had any sponsors. Yeah. Right. And if you look, listen to the early episode. The first time I did it, I think I ambushed you." - Jordy Hayes [[00:12:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=12m32s)

"We made a sheet of like, these are our friends, these are our enemies... It was like HVAC Roll-Ups were the enemies... It was like the CCP... It's not like we're sitting, it's not a spike show. But silly stuff, and we kept it on the table for the first [months]." - Jordy Hayes [[01:28:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=1h28m0s)

### Perspective 3: The 15-Minute Interview Format Is Often Better Than 90 Minutes
Most podcasts default to long-form when many guests would be more interesting in shorter bursts at specific moments in their journey.

**Substantiation:**
"The reason that if we do a 15 minute interview, the reason that it's great is probably that historically it would have been a 90 minute interview, and that was way too much time for that person at that point in their career, that moment, right? And so we just recognize it's much more interesting to hear for 10 minutes from somebody like in a specific moment in time than 90 minutes... Like a lot of, we talk to a lot of like seed series A, series B founders that are just kind of like starting their journeys. And someday they might be like an Alex Karp or a Palmer Luckey or a Mark Andreessen and that they can just talk and talk and talk and it's entertaining, but they're not at that point yet." - Jordy Hayes [[02:08:54]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=2h8m44s)

### Perspective 4: Simplicity and Humor Give Permission to Experiment
Starting with humor or performance art creates space to try radically different formats that would seem too risky if positioned seriously from day one.

**Substantiation:**
"I think there's seeds in humor, because humor gives you the permission to do something low status... Even the soylent thing, it was definitely like a social experiment. We didn't even know if it was just a complete joke the whole time. But then it went viral, and people wanted to buy it. But as a YC company, starting like a consumer package of goods company, it was extremely low status... So everything was like Polish and sane. So when you start with some, with you start with the lens of like humor or performance art, it gives you the ability to broaden the aperture to like get really weird." - John Coogan [[02:04:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=2h3m50s)

### Perspective 5: Media Should Assume You're Always Caught Up, Not Constantly Re-explain
Traditional TV over-explains because it assumes random channel-surfing. Internet-native shows can assume their audience knows the basics.

**Substantiation:**
"We don't tell you, you know, part, like we're making a decision to not say what AWS is. We don't, we don't, traditional television will be like, AWS is a cloud computing division... And it's like part of that steep learning curve is very powerful because people ramp up and then they're like, okay, I'm, I'm really a part of it. And it feels like you're actually talking to me." - Jordy Hayes [[01:29:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=1h29m15s)

**Why mentioned:** Cited as rare example of tech company that broke naming conventions by looking outside tech for inspiration
**Quote:** "The browser company, right? The whole way to name a company and they were able, like, that was just the naming of that company was valuable because it stood out, it was like, wait, this is a consumer tech company that are creating a browser, they have this, like, you know, cursive logo mark, it just stood out immediately, right? And you could tell that it was inspired. They weren't the first company to name themselves like the blank company." - Jordy Hayes [[00:45:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=44m55s)

### Company: OpenRouter

**Why mentioned:** Used as example of audience catching analysis errors in real-time during live show
**Quote:** "I remember last week we were talking about model adoption on OpenRouter. And we missed a key thing, which was two out of the three top models were free, and the others were paid. And very, very obvious. But in the moment, we didn't put that together. Somebody in the chat is like, yeah, this is important. And so not only did that make the analysis better, it was like community sourced." - Jordy Hayes [[01:40:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=1h39m50s)

### Company: Donut Media
**Description:** Automotive YouTube media company
**Why mentioned:** Example from Jordy's past work at Branded Native of established media companies successfully monetizing

And then within a year, we were interviewing Mark Zuckerberg and the entire Meta team about the latest Ray Bans, which at Meta Campus, at the Sports Center desk, very different from the second episode." - John Coogan [[00:08:09]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=7m59s)

## 4. People Identified

### Person: Will Manidis
**Description:** Entrepreneur and connector who introduced John and Jordy
**Why mentioned:** Key enabler of partnership and consistent cheerleader with unique hyperbolic support style
**Quote:** "For the first six months, every time we would text with him just about some mundane decision we were making, he was like, yeah, that's great. I just told, and he would drop the name of some tier one fund. He's just like, I just told them that we're over subscribed at 400 posts. And it's like, we weren't fundraising... He would also do these funny things just being like, yes, I've updated my thinking. He would use the language of like a philosophical venture capitalist. He'd be like, yes, I've updated my thinking on TBPN, and I no longer think it will merely destroy all podcasts, but I think it will actually destroy all of media." - John Coogan [[01:53:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=1h53m13s)

### Person: Andrew Sorkin
**Description:** CNBC anchor and New York Times journalist
**Why mentioned:** Example of professional broadcaster who elevated their show with high-energy interview
**Quote:** "Interviewing Andrew Sorkin today was super energizing. It made the show better. Super energizing. We would have been happy to keep doing that for much longer. And the whole chat was like, this is an amazing interview, great interview. I love this. Yeah, they're just really excited to hear from him. And it's helpful that he's a professional TV host. And it's not his first rodeo." - Jordy Hayes [[01:44:06]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=1h43m56s)

So you're so not getting like, oh my gosh, if there's like, oh, yeah, there were 25 interns who came in this morning and they all told me that they showed me all the lines they wrote for you guys just." - Jackson Dahl [[00:35:34]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=35m24s)

### Person: Roon (Anonymous AI Researcher)

**Why mentioned:** Example of influential tech voice that traditional media ignores but TBPN regularly features
**Quote:** "We've curated all these amazing thinkers that are constantly putting information and takes out in the world and we're curating those and they are fundamentally like a key part of the show. And interestingly, the sports world has done a great job of embracing posters, like Steve Smith reacts to random people with hot takes about basketball or sports. And Pat McAfee will elevate a post about something. But for some reason, maybe it's just the private markets thing, but like business television has not... I feel like it would have seen if Roon had ever been on Bloomberg, for example. That would be an amazing moment." - John Coogan [[01:55:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=1h55m37s)

## 5. Operating Insights

### Insight 1: Narrow Aperture Through the Day - Start Broad, End Specific
Their daily prep follows a deliberate funnel from wide-ranging discussion to precise execution, maximizing creative exploration while ensuring tight delivery.

**Substantiation:**
"I would view the daily routine as like a narrowing of the aperture. So when we meet at the gym, we're often talking about stuff that might may or may not make it on the show. Oh, you know, watch this movie or what was going on just broadly in like group chats and online, like different news stories that are kicking around. And then by the time we're at breakfast, we're kind of honing in on like what the key topics are. And then once we get to the studio, we're actually like taking screenshots that you will see on the show of individual posts or Wall Street Journal articles." - John Coogan [[01:42:06]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=1h41m56s)

### Insight 2: Protect the Partnership Dynamic Through Constant One-Upping
The partnership works because they consistently challenge each other's ideas in areas where each person is already expert, preventing complacency.

**Substantiation:**
"John's one of the few people, and certainly, like, at the top of the list of people where when I talk about the things that I'm good at, like, he's consistently bringing ideas that are better than my own... To come to John with an idea in a space that I'm good at generating ideas in. So let's say it's an advertiser that we're working for, and I'm like, I want to pitch them on this concept, and I come with an idea, and he's like, okay, what if you did it this way? Typically, when I pitch those ideas to people, they're just like, that sounds great, you know? And I'm not getting one upped, and so when you have a partnership, it's like, you want to be getting one up. Like, all the time. That's like what makes a partnership great is that two people combining or creating something better than any one of them would do individually." - Jordy Hayes [[01:50:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=1h50m25s)

### Insight 3: Don't Negotiate Hard with Creative Talent
Maintaining relationships and getting best work from creative partners requires respecting their pricing rather than grinding on every deal.

**Substantiation:**
"I also don't, I also cherish that dynamic. Like I don't negotiate heavily with creative talent. And that might sound crazy because your job is to get great services for the lowest possible price. But if you go into a dynamic with a designer, I certainly will get a proposal. And I'll think that is wildly more than I value what we're trying to do here. Thank you. We're going to go elsewhere. But if I'm close in the ballpark with a creative that I want to do work with, I'm not sitting there being like, hey, you pitched us 20K, our budget is 6K, because sometimes they'll opt in, but then in their head, they're thinking, I'm doing 6K work." - Jordy Hayes [[01:24:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=1h24m34s)

### Insight 4: Entertainment, Inspiration, or Education - Pick One and Execute
All successful content must clearly deliver on at least one of these three value propositions; confusion means failure.

**Substantiation:**
"I think it's much more, like the way that I think about it is everything you do from a marketing standpoint should entertain people, should inspire them or educate them. And then it's like, I don't know that many other buckets that stuff can fit into... When people pitch us marketing ideas, I tell them, I have more context on your business than 99.9% of people in the world. And I'm going to need you to repeat that marketing idea back to me because I'm still confused. And if you hit the timeline with this, you're going to have a bunch of people that, like if their immediate reaction is like, wait, what's going on? And so they're certainly not entertained because being confused is not a great state to be in. They're certainly not inspired... And then they're certainly not being educated." - Jordy Hayes [[01:15:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=1h14m55s)

### Insight 5: Maintain Same Schedule Every Day to Protect Creative Process
Consistency in daily routine eliminates decision fatigue and protects the most valuable preparation time.

**Substantiation:**
"We try not to adjust the schedule at all. We've tried it. We've tried to fit a breakfast in with external people. It doesn't work at all. And so we try to have the exact same morning, every morning leading up into the show. And our, the, the process that's worked well as we show up and from 630 to 915, we just talk about what we're planning to talk about on the show and we debate a bunch of stuff. And we sort of sharpen our thinking and just go back and forth." - Jordy Hayes [[01:43:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=1h43m8s)

## 6. Overlooked Insights

### Insight 1: The Newsletter as Forcing Function for Daily Debate
While many noticed their newsletter, the real insight is how it serves as a structured warmup that captures and crystallizes their morning discussions into shareable form before the show.

**Substantiation:**
"I was thinking like, really, like, I'm writing this for Jordy. Like I'm pitching an idea to Jordy... There's a little bit of like Jordy capture in the sense of like, I'm trying to find something, I'm not trying to find something that I'm like, you have to actually try to make something that will make you like tee off. Yeah. I don't want to bore you... The newsletter, the newsletter is we, we, we meet at 630 every morning... from 630 to 915, we just talk about what we're planning to talk about on the show and we debate a bunch of stuff. And so the entire time that we're working out in the morning, uh, it is just back and forth on whatever is top of mind... And so by the time we show up to the office, usually I get immediately start getting on Zoom meetings for whatever we're working on in the business. And John starts just writing. And so I've never had writer's block because I'm just kind of like transcribing the discussion that we already had." - John Coogan/Jordy Hayes [[00:31:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=31m22s)

This is hugely significant because it reveals their entire content system: the newsletter isn't just distribution, it's the articulation layer that forces clarity on their morning debates and serves as the show's outline. Most people think it's just SEO or audience-building.

### Insight 2: Geographic Arbitrage Enabled the Business Model
Being in LA rather than SF was critical - it gave them access to Hollywood production talent and infrastructure while avoiding the pressure to build a traditional tech company, but this was presented almost as an afterthought.

**Substantiation:**
"The idea of building a tech company in LA is joke to me. It's just not something that you really, I'm sure you can do it. But again, ignoring El Segundo, because that's its own thing. And so we were in a position where we both have kids... They're set up in their communities. We had no desire to... I really felt like if I wanted to build another company, I had to move to San Francisco or New York. And I didn't necessarily want to do that. I like LA County... And so media was the perfect business to start and stay involved with the world that we love and get to talk all day long with our friends... while building a business that is extremely well suited to build in Hollywood and build in LA. And to you guys. Because we are not looking to hire. We're not looking to hire 50 engineers in the next two years... Where is the best place in the world to build a media and entertainment company? It's like LA, right?" - Jordy Hayes [[02:01:39]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIaXSQOHrmU&t=2h1m29s)

This is massively overlooked - their location choice wasn't lifestyle preference, it was strategic infrastructure arbitrage. They get world-class production resources and creative talent in LA that would be impossible in SF, while avoiding the venture-scale-or-die pressure that would have forced them to build a network instead of a show. This geographic hack enabled the entire sustainable business model but was mentioned almost in passing.

---

**Summary:** John Coogan and Jordy Hayes built TBPN by rejecting nearly every convention of both tech media and podcasting. They chose daily live shows over recorded episodes, advertising over subscriptions, 15-minute interviews over 90-minute deep dives, and committed to being the talent indefinitely rather than building a scalable media company. Their success comes from treating content as an iterative product with daily compounding improvements, stealing ideas from industries outside tech, and maintaining ruthless focus on serving 200,000 highly valuable people rather than chasing mass-market appeal. The partnership works because they continuously challenge each other in their areas of expertise, maintain identical daily routines to protect creative process, and leverage LA's production infrastructure while avoiding Silicon Valley's venture-scale pressure.
