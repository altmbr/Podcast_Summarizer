[00:00:00] They're like declaring a code red.
[00:00:01] SPEAKER_02: We're not winning on the product.
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_02: And now we're going to make the product worse
[00:00:06] SPEAKER_02: with advertising.
[00:00:07] SPEAKER_02: All right.
[00:00:08] Welcome back to the newcomer podcast.
[00:00:17] SPEAKER_01: Tom here, Eric and Madeline.
[00:00:20] SPEAKER_01: We're going to talk now about OpenAI
[00:00:22] SPEAKER_01: and the state of affairs in the AI race.
[00:00:25] SPEAKER_01: Because it's been a very chaotic, seeming couple of days
[00:00:29] SPEAKER_01: to alert.
[00:00:30] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:00:31] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_01: They're flashing lights happening over in the mission stream.
[00:00:35] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:00:37] SPEAKER_01: They're just running through the corridors screaming
[00:00:39] SPEAKER_01: and throwing papers in the air at OpenAI.
[00:00:41] SPEAKER_01: But yeah, door locks are coming down.
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:00:44] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_02: Going through the OpenAI offices.
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_02: It looks like alien when they're locking down for the creature
[00:00:50] SPEAKER_00: in the ship.
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:00:52] SPEAKER_01: Now there are people that's like, you're in or out right now.
[00:00:53] SPEAKER_01: Like the water is filling into the rooms and people's hands are pressed
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_01: up against the glass.
[00:00:58] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_01: So the same ultimate recently declared a code red.
[00:01:01] SPEAKER_01: Did you order the code red?
[00:01:03] SPEAKER_02: I did the job.
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_02: Did you order the code red?
[00:01:05] SPEAKER_02: I got them right.
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_02: I did.
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_02: Inside.
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_01: I don't know why it's so funny to be.
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_01: He set out a memo to employees saying that they needed a code red alert on on chat GPT
[00:01:16] SPEAKER_01: that there's a lot of competitive threats in the app is not working as well as they wanted
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_01: to right now.
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_01: And this came a couple weeks after he also kind of warned employees that there was about
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_01: to be a very bad news cycle around OpenAI as Gemini and Google in particular was breathing
[00:01:33] SPEAKER_01: down their necks and they released a new model that was really good.
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_01: And everyone now is down on OpenAI.
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_01: Tom's literal first story in newcomer said, yeah, Gemini, Google, they're in a better
[00:01:44] SPEAKER_02: place than you might think.
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:01:46] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_02: Read the newsletter.
[00:01:49] SPEAKER_00: Read the newsletter.
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_02: You could have made a bunch of money.
[00:01:51] SPEAKER_02: I'd love to take more credit for it.
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_01: But I was just talking to me of sources at Google who were like, yeah, we have a really
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_01: good model here.
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_01: I don't know why everyone decided that we were fucked.
[00:02:01] SPEAKER_01: Like, you know, Google literally invented key parts of the transformer technology.
[00:02:06] SPEAKER_01: Well, on the David Sacks, all the all in guys are like, Google, the culture is going
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_02: to ruin the whole thing.
[00:02:10] SPEAKER_02: It didn't make any sense.
[00:02:11] SPEAKER_02: And all the headroom guys have been super like standoffish about Google.
[00:02:15] SPEAKER_02: I don't understand it.
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:02:17] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_02: Keep going.
[00:02:19] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_02: Google is the threat.
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_02: Obviously, obviously.
[00:02:22] SPEAKER_02: And they make money either way.
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_02: That's the beauty beautiful thing with Google.
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_02: They have Google Cloud, you know, and they have a search.
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_02: So they can drive the costs like they do with, you know, their workspaces stuff.
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_02: You know, they can screw over everybody else by offering things that some people want to
[00:02:37] SPEAKER_02: build money.
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:02:39] SPEAKER_02: They're a monopoly is what you're trying to say.
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_02: You're saying they own the internet.
[00:02:43] SPEAKER_02: I know.
[00:02:44] SPEAKER_02: Is that improving in a quarter of a line?
[00:02:45] SPEAKER_02: I can't say anything about that.
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_02: But yeah.
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_01: It's like they have the full stack.
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_01: And I think what's been like clear in the last couple of weeks is that like, they're competitive
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_01: at every part of it.
[00:02:54] SPEAKER_01: Like Google Cloud is a major player in cloud, which we all knew.
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_01: The TPUs, which people kind of all forgot about are like the only legitimate competitor to
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_01: NVIDIA's chips.
[00:03:02] SPEAKER_01: And now they have one of the best models.
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_01: We didn't capture how much TPUs were going to be a credible competitor.
[00:03:07] SPEAKER_02: I don't think.
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_01: Well, they've been working on it for a long time.
[00:03:10] SPEAKER_01: Like you compare that to like open AI, which is very johnny come lately with all of these
[00:03:13] SPEAKER_01: things.
[00:03:14] SPEAKER_01: They're basically like building a airplane in the sky or whatever that metaphor is.
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_01: Whereas like Google is literally the airplane.
[00:03:21] SPEAKER_01: Like, you know, they certainly were slow when it came to embracing it and like had a lot
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_01: of concerns ethically, which is interesting.
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_01: Even though of course, I hope people listening to this podcast already know this fact, but
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_02: attention is all you need.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_02: The seminal AI paper was written by Google employees.
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_02: Like so they were they were there.
[00:03:39] SPEAKER_02: They knew it.
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_02: They gave it away for free.
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_02: They created this whole problem themselves.
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_02: And so yeah, I was frustrating that they weren't like leading from the whole time.
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_02: Like you invented this category.
[00:03:49] SPEAKER_02: But you know, yeah.
[00:03:50] SPEAKER_02: Not surprising that they would figure it out and catch up.
[00:03:53] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_01: And so what I guess is more interesting to me now is like the state of affairs going forward
[00:03:58] SPEAKER_01: because the idea that open AI is fucked is literally just a, I mean, open AI and Sam
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_01: ultimate assisted, but it's a creation of media.
[00:04:07] SPEAKER_01: Nothing is fundamentally changed about the business.
[00:04:10] SPEAKER_01: Like their model maybe isn't ranking as highly on traffic.
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_01: I think there are some traffic numbers right.
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_01: Traffic is a little down.
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:04:17] SPEAKER_00: But I will say also, Sam Altman is such a savvy media player.
[00:04:23] SPEAKER_00: He knows that if he sends an email to the entire company that says code red and a memo that
[00:04:28] SPEAKER_00: that's going to get leaked to a reporter.
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_00: Like, and it's very possible open AI leaked it itself.
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_02: Like a lot of these company memos, they know they're going to come out and some of them,
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_02: the company's leak, you know, I don't have proof either way on this one, but just as reporter,
[00:04:43] these company memos, especially in the Facebook era, we're coming out so often that I think
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_02: companies were definitely handing them out to reporters because it's like, we're blasting
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_02: them to all our employees.
[00:04:52] SPEAKER_02: This is the message we want out there.
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_02: And it gives, it gives the statement some sincerity that you wouldn't get if you put it,
[00:04:57] SPEAKER_02: if you put out a press release saying, oh, we're, we're in trouble.
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_02: Like people will be like, what?
[00:05:01] SPEAKER_02: But if you're like, it's to employees.
[00:05:02] SPEAKER_02: It's like, well, that's what they're saying authentically inside.
[00:05:05] SPEAKER_02: Then we metabolize it in the culture.
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_02: They wrote this for public consumption, whether they leaked it or not, right?
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:05:13] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:05:14] SPEAKER_01: My belief is that they didn't leak it on purpose.
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_01: And I think the reason you can, I can say that confidently is that they're actually
[00:05:20] SPEAKER_01: weren't that many outlets that reported it with their own reporting.
[00:05:23] SPEAKER_01: It's actually only been a small handful of them.
[00:05:25] SPEAKER_01: Oh, right.
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_01: So if everybody says we have a source, then the company is like, all right.
[00:05:29] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:05:31] SPEAKER_02: That was true.
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_02: Here's the memo.
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_01: But that said, like Sam is a smart guy who knows how the media works and when you do send
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_01: something out, you know it's going to happen.
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_01: So the level of intentionality is sort of irrelevant at that point.
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_01: But I think like Google also had a code red exactly three years ago to this time where they
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_01: were worried about the state of Google search and and chat GPT was taking off like a rocket.
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_01: And here's where we are now.
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_01: So and I think Facebook in the past is, you know, Mark has declared various code reds
[00:06:02] SPEAKER_01: over different things.
[00:06:03] SPEAKER_01: And I think actually over Google plus when that first came out, there was a lot of concern
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_01: over there.
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_01: So it's stupid to take from this like the beginning of the end.
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_01: And I saw some people tweeting that out.
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_01: It's like when you've declared a code red, it's already over.
[00:06:16] SPEAKER_01: You've already lost, you know, your men are already dead.
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_01: And it's like we're so early in this and I hate using metaphor, but it literally is
[00:06:24] SPEAKER_01: true.
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_01: Like if you can go from like an also ran like Google was a couple of months ago, like
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_01: when I wrote that piece, like everyone thought Google was done.
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_01: And here we are months later and they have the best model everything.
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_01: So it's like a lot is going to change.
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_01: So the thing that does sort of start to worry me about opening I is like, I do think they
[00:06:41] SPEAKER_01: have too many plates spinning right now.
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_01: I think they are literally trying to become Google at a time that Google already exists.
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_01: And I don't know like where their focus is going to end up being.
[00:06:51] SPEAKER_01: Like you've got the chat GPT stuff.
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_01: You've got the Stargate stuff.
[00:06:57] SPEAKER_01: You've got the Johnny I have stuff.
[00:06:58] SPEAKER_01: You've got the browser stuff.
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_01: Like I'm probably missing five or six other things.
[00:07:02] SPEAKER_01: They're trying to get an advertising right now.
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_02: The meme is trying to get ads.
[00:07:06] SPEAKER_02: They're like declaring a code red.
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_02: We're not winning on the product.
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_02: And now we're going to make the product worse with advertising.
[00:07:14] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_01: Which, man, the whole advertising thing too, you know, we had Alex Heath on what well
[00:07:18] SPEAKER_01: you were out Eric and, you know, I like Alex a lot.
[00:07:21] SPEAKER_01: He's an amazingly well-sourced supporter.
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_01: So you can go read his newsletter.
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, go read sources and his podcast is called access.
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_01: But he was, you know, very, I thought a little bit to, I think a little too
[00:07:32] SPEAKER_01: incredulous on the fact that ads is going to be a big business for open AI.
[00:07:36] SPEAKER_01: I think actually ads is going to be very difficult for them because ads rely on proof of concept
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_01: and proof of success and also linking out and clicking out.
[00:07:45] SPEAKER_01: And it's sort of proved that this stuff does not link out very well.
[00:07:47] SPEAKER_01: So why would you want?
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_01: I'm shopping for all my Christmas gifts in Sh and GBT.
[00:07:51] SPEAKER_01: I don't agree.
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_02: Well, anyway, this is a different discussion.
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_01: I just think it's going to be complicated for them.
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_01: I don't think it's a done deal.
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_01: And I worry for them if I were an investor, which is increasingly everyone basically,
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_01: you know, VCs on upwards that like they are going to lose focus.
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_01: And what they're trying to win on is like increasingly competitive.
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_01: And that to me is more like the red alert than like chat GBT's losing customers or something
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_01: like that.
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_01: It's just like what matters and what doesn't matter and should be doing, should we be
[00:08:22] SPEAKER_01: doing everything?
[00:08:24] SPEAKER_01: And I would be, I don't know, we'll get to predictions in a later episode, but I wouldn't
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_01: be surprised if in the next year or two you start seeing OpenAI dropping some of these
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_01: ambitions.
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_01: That's something like the browser just sort of goes away.
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_01: It's not that necessary or I don't know.
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_01: I really don't have a lot of bullishness on the Johnny I have hardware project.
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_01: I think that is going to be expensive and difficult, but that's where I would be worried
[00:08:53] SPEAKER_01: about them.
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_02: So selling TAM, you need to be able to do everything.
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_02: I mean, there's some value to OpenAI and it's been ready if a category appears promising
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_02: that they can lean in.
[00:09:04] SPEAKER_02: It's like, oh, coding is big.
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_02: We'll lean into that.
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_02: So you have projects for the spinning.
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
[00:09:10] The piece that's stuck out to me with all of this too is that each iteration of the startup
[00:09:16] SPEAKER_00: boom, whether we should be looking at applications or foundation models and how do we build
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_00: up products and how do the large labs also build up products?
[00:09:24] Every time a new model comes out, like the string Gemini model, the race is totally reset.
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_00: So all of the people that I think have talked about, you know, will foundation models ever
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_00: beat the moat, the answer seems to be no.
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_00: Again, as it just keeps climbing and chasing back and forth and every few months we get
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_00: a new model that tops the leaderboard and then OpenAI is back at the top and then Google
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_00: is back at the top.
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_00: So it's not that I don't think I would count them out at all.
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_00: Obviously, I think it's still too early, but it just becomes a lot trickier to see,
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_00: you know, can you beat the everything company when the everything company already exists?
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_00: Like you need to figure out applications beyond Chatchy B.T. at work because you will
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_00: not get the moat with foundation models.
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_00: Like this race seems like it's nowhere here done.
[00:10:05] SPEAKER_00: Which is why I think ads feels like hard before the horse and that, yeah, OpenAI Chatchy
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_02: B.T. needs more of a more clear design to applications before just, I don't know, going
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_02: into monetization.
[00:10:19] SPEAKER_02: I want to say one, I guess my last word on this is I do think it speaks to the power
[00:10:28] SPEAKER_02: of truth that OpenAI is saying code red.
[00:10:31] SPEAKER_02: I do think there's value in shaping your company's narrative in just saying, yeah, we're
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_02: in a hard place because it undercuts the media and the commentary and just like Twitter
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_02: and regular people would all be like, oh, OpenAI is in trouble because of Gemini.
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_02: But when you say, oh, it's a code red, we're in big trouble, then you lower the bar for
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_02: yourself.
[00:10:53] SPEAKER_02: So maybe it hurts your reputation, but instead of having to fend off like, oh, Google,
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_02: are they better than you say, yeah, we're really needing to work hard.
[00:11:01] SPEAKER_02: And so then everything you do to sort of be slightly better than a code red is now a
[00:11:07] SPEAKER_02: positive again.
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_02: And so I think there's a lot of value in just, you know, communication strategy and lowering
[00:11:14] SPEAKER_02: expectations for yourself so that you can much more easily step over them.
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_02: If you think entirely through narratives, then you're setting yourself up for your comeback,
[00:11:23] SPEAKER_01: you're setting yourself up for like, we girded down and now everything is great.
[00:11:27] SPEAKER_01: And we, we, the same way Google sort of did when they had their code red and now everyone's,
[00:11:31] SPEAKER_01: you know, celebrating them.
[00:11:33] SPEAKER_01: So genius moved by Sam Altman, where we applaud you, tip of the cap for your great decision
[00:11:39] SPEAKER_01: to call yourself a good guy.
[00:11:40] SPEAKER_01: I think Google is savvy about the PR.
[00:11:42] SPEAKER_02: I think they're just just building and trying.
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_02: I think Sam is very aware of, you know, how the narrative is consumed.
[00:11:50] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:11:52] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_01: We'll fun to talk about this more next week or whenever when we do our prediction.
[00:11:56] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we're going to do predictions.
[00:11:57] SPEAKER_02: We're going to have superlatives.
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_02: I think it's going to be a fun end of the year for the newcomer podcast.
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_02: We're trying to split up segments so that you can listen to the things you're interested
