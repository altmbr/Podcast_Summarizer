# Podcast Summary: The Newcomer Podcast - OpenAI's Code Red & The AI Race

## 1. Key Themes

### The AI Race is Perpetually Resetting - No Lasting Moat in Foundation Models

The competitive landscape in AI is experiencing constant upheaval with each new model release, preventing any player from establishing a durable competitive advantage. This challenges the prevailing venture capital thesis about foundation model defensibility.

**Substantiation:** "Every time a new model comes out, like the string Gemini model, the race is totally reset. So all of the people that I think have talked about, you know, will foundation models ever beat the moat, the answer seems to be no. Again, as it just keeps climbing and chasing back and forth and every few months we get a new model that tops the leaderboard and then OpenAI is back at the top and then Google is back at the top." - Eric Newcomer [[00:10:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW9EyoiIMco&t=10m14s)

### Google's Full-Stack Advantage Makes Them the Real Threat

Despite years of dismissal from Silicon Valley insiders, Google's integrated infrastructure across cloud, chips, and models positions them as the dominant competitive force in AI. Their monopolistic advantages allow them to compete on multiple levels simultaneously.

**Substantiation:** "They have the full stack. And I think what's been like clear in the last couple of weeks is that like, they're competitive at every part of it. Like Google Cloud is a major player in cloud, which we all knew. The TPUs, which people kind of all forgot about are like the only legitimate competitor to NVIDIA's chips. And now they have one of the best models." - Tom Dotan [[00:02:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW9EyoiIMco&t=2m39s)

Tom Dotan also noted: "They're a monopoly... They own the internet... they can drive the costs like they do with, you know, their workspaces stuff. You know, they can screw over everybody else by offering things that some people want to build money." - Eric Newcomer [[00:02:34]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW9EyoiIMco&t=2m24s)

### OpenAI's Strategic Diffusion Problem - Too Many Plates Spinning

OpenAI is attempting to build multiple businesses simultaneously (chat interface, hardware, browser, advertising, infrastructure) while competing against incumbents who already dominate these categories. This lack of focus represents a greater existential threat than any single competitive challenge.

**Substantiation:** "I do think they have too many plates spinning right now. I think they are literally trying to become Google at a time that Google already exists... You've got the chat GPT stuff. You've got the Stargate stuff. You've got the Johnny I have stuff. You've got the browser stuff... They're trying to get an advertising right now." - Tom Dotan [[00:06:41]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW9EyoiIMco&t=6m31s)

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### Code Red Declarations Are Strategic PR Moves, Not Genuine Distress Signals

While the media and public interpret "code red" memos as signs of crisis, they're actually sophisticated narrative management tools that lower expectations and set up comebacks. Sam Altman understands that broadcasting internal concerns provides authenticity while resetting the competitive narrative.

**Substantiation:** "Sam Altman is such a savvy media player. He knows that if he sends an email to the entire company that says code red and a memo that that's going to get leaked to a reporter... These company memos, especially in the Facebook era, we're coming out so often that I think companies were definitely handing them out to reporters because it's like, we're blasting them to all our employees. This is the message we want out there." - Eric Newcomer [[00:04:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW9EyoiIMco&t=4m13s)

Eric Newcomer further explained the strategic value: "I do think there's value in shaping your company's narrative in just saying, yeah, we're in a hard place because it undercuts the media and the commentary... when you say, oh, it's a code red, we're in big trouble, then you lower the bar for yourself... everything you do to sort of be slightly better than a code red is now a positive again." [[00:10:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW9EyoiIMco&t=10m18s)

### AI Advertising Will Be Harder to Monetize Than Everyone Assumes

Contrary to the conventional wisdom that OpenAI can simply replicate Google's ad business, AI interfaces present fundamental challenges for advertising effectiveness due to low click-through rates and lack of proof-of-concept metrics that advertisers depend on.

**Substantiation:** "The whole advertising thing... I think a little too incredulous on the fact that ads is going to be a big business for open AI. I think actually ads is going to be very difficult for them because ads rely on proof of concept and proof of success and also linking out and clicking out. And it's sort of proved that this stuff does not link out very well. So why would you want?" - Tom Dotan [[00:07:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW9EyoiIMco&t=7m22s)

The timing concern was highlighted: "They're like declaring a code red. We're not winning on the product. And now we're going to make the product worse with advertising." - Eric Newcomer [[00:07:06]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW9EyoiIMco&t=6m56s)

### Google Was Never Actually Behind - The Valley Got It Wrong

The dominant Silicon Valley narrative that Google was culturally incapable of competing in AI was fundamentally flawed. Google invented the core transformer technology and maintained technical excellence throughout, despite being written off by prominent investors and commentators.

**Substantiation:** "I was just talking to me of sources at Google who were like, yeah, we have a really good model here. I don't know why everyone decided that we were fucked. Like, you know, Google literally invented key parts of the transformer technology." - Tom Dotan [[00:01:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW9EyoiIMco&t=1m47s)

Tom Dotan reinforced this: "Attention is all you need. The seminal AI paper was written by Google employees. Like so they were they were there. They knew it. They gave it away for free. They created this whole problem themselves." - Eric Newcomer [[00:03:33]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW9EyoiIMco&t=3m23s)

## 5. Operating Insights

### Internal Memos Are Public Communications - Write Accordingly

Company leaders should recognize that any memo sent to employees will likely become public, and should craft these communications with that reality in mind rather than expecting confidentiality.

**Substantiation:** "These company memos, especially in the Facebook era, we're coming out so often that I think companies were definitely handing them out to reporters because it's like, we're blasting them to all our employees. This is the message we want out there. And it gives, it gives the statement some sincerity that you wouldn't get if you put it, if you put out a press release." - Eric Newcomer [[00:04:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW9EyoiIMco&t=4m33s)

### Expectation Management Through Controlled Pessimism

Leaders can strategically lower expectations through authentic-seeming internal communications to create space for positive surprises and narrative comebacks, rather than constantly defending against external criticism.

**Substantiation:** "I do think there's value in shaping your company's narrative in just saying, yeah, we're in a hard place because it undercuts the media and the commentary... when you say, oh, it's a code red, we're in big trouble, then you lower the bar for yourself. So maybe it hurts your reputation, but instead of having to fend off like, oh, Google, are they better than you say, yeah, we're really needing to work hard." - Eric Newcomer [[00:10:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW9EyoiIMco&t=10m18s)

### Historical Code Reds Don't Predict Outcomes

"Code red" moments in competitive history (Facebook vs. Google Plus, Google vs. ChatGPT) demonstrate that crisis declarations are poor predictors of actual business outcomes and often precede recoveries.

**Substantiation:** "Google also had a code red exactly three years ago to this time where they were worried about the state of Google search and and chat GPT was taking off like a rocket. And here's where we are now... Mark has declared various code reds over different things. And I think actually over Google plus when that first came out... It's stupid to take from this like the beginning of the end." - Tom Dotan [[00:05:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW9EyoiIMco&t=5m37s)

### Focus Beats Optionality in Winner-Take-All Markets

When competing against full-stack incumbents, startups may need to narrow scope rather than expand, even if it limits addressable market presentation to investors.

**Substantiation:** "What they're trying to win on is like increasingly competitive. And that to me is more like the red alert than like chat GBT's losing customers or something like that. It's just like what matters and what doesn't matter and should be doing, should we be doing everything?... I wouldn't be surprised if in the next year or two you start seeing OpenAI dropping some of these ambitions." - Tom Dotan [[00:08:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW9EyoiIMco&t=8m3s)

## 6. Overlooked Insights

### TPUs As NVIDIA's Only Legitimate Competitor Went Unnoticed

While the market obsessed over OpenAI vs. Google on the model layer, Google's TPU chip development has quietly emerged as the only credible alternative to NVIDIA's dominance in AI compute—a strategic advantage with enormous implications for cost structure and vertical integration that investors and analysts largely missed.

**Substantiation:** "The TPUs, which people kind of all forgot about are like the only legitimate competitor to NVIDIA's chips... We didn't capture how much TPUs were going to be a credible competitor. I don't think." - Tom Dotan and Eric Newcomer [[00:02:59]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW9EyoiIMco&t=2m49s)

This is significant because it means Google can potentially avoid NVIDIA's pricing power while competitors remain dependent, creating a sustainable cost advantage in an infrastructure-heavy race.

### The Application Layer Still Hasn't Been Solved Before Monetization Push

While everyone debates foundation model superiority, OpenAI is rushing to advertising without establishing clear, defensible application patterns beyond basic chat—suggesting the company may be prematurely optimizing for revenue rather than product-market fit in specific use cases.

**Substantiation:** "OpenAI Chatchy B.T. needs more of a more clear design to applications before just, I don't know, going into monetization... Which is why I think ads feels like hard before the horse." - Eric Newcomer [[00:10:11]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW9EyoiIMco&t=10m1s)

This insight suggests that despite billions in funding and market leadership, OpenAI hasn't yet discovered the killer applications that would justify an advertising business model, indicating the entire industry may be less mature than valuations suggest.
