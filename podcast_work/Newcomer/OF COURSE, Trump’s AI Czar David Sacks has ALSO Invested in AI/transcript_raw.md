[00:00:00] We're so numb at this point to just the level of self-dealing in this administration that, you know, just not fully divesting from your VC fund, you know, when you go into a special appointed position is like small potatoes.
[00:00:19] Welcome back to the newcomer podcast, Tom Doton here. I'm joined by Eric newcomer, Madeline Renbarger.
[00:00:24] SPEAKER_02: We're talking now about David Sacks, a man of many opinions, both his own and the way people feel about him. I'm excited to get into this one because we've got thoughts. And the reason David is in the news is the New York Times on Sunday of this week, I think it was Sunday put out a big piece, big expose. Man, I sound like Tucker Carlson when I said that. I don't want to load. I don't want to load it too much right now. They had an expose. It was apparently many months in the making where they were trying to fairly
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_02: deliberately show the conflicts of interest that David Sacks has as the AI and crypto's are to the Trump administration with his ongoing role as a venture capitalist. He is the thing managing partner at craft ventures.
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_02: And basically the story lays out that while in this role, he has been advocating for kind of maximalist AI policies that, you know, do not burden AI with a lot of regulation. And then same with crypto, probably even more so with crypto.
[00:01:22] SPEAKER_02: And he's also got these ongoing investments that are theoretically benefited by all of these policies. And just as like the last part of this recap, it was one of the article came out became a whole thing on Twitter. David Sacks called it a hit job in a hoax and said the New York Times was later spiraling and you had all these VCs and founders rushing to defend David Sacks saying how important he was to them and to their families and their children.
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_02: And really one of the great men of all time David Sacks. And then, you know, the reporters in the story, including Ryan Mac, who is known for getting into fights on Twitter. Very vocally defending the story. And it was all kind of a mess.
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_02: So that was my rundown of everything that happened over the last couple of days. But let's just start off with David Sacks, the guy, because he's been this figure for a long time. I mean, Eric, you were writing a lot about xenophets back in the day, which was the first time David Sacks seriously crossed my radar.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_02: So I imagine you've been following the opinions about him for a while. I mean, what?
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_02: All right. So, you know, David Sacks, member of the PayPal Mafia, Confidant of Peter Teal. In some ways, the guy in the PayPal Mafia, who really did the work.
[00:02:36] SPEAKER_01: I mean, I think he was the chief operating officer. And so he was often the one like really, really grinding.
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_01: So he built this great network that includes some of the people circling the wagons for him after this New York Times story.
[00:02:49] SPEAKER_01: He found a sort of early version of Slack called Yammer that sells for a good bit of money.
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_01: It establishes him as a successful entrepreneur, though Yammer, which I believe purchased Microsoft.
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it doesn't last as like a product. I think feels like sort of a hollow exit.
[00:03:10] SPEAKER_01: You know, one of these sort of people make money. And then acquisition goes nowhere. Sort of deals.
[00:03:17] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I got introduced to him in this fight over Zenefits, you know, Parker Conrad. Now the CEO of Ripley gets forced out.
[00:03:27] SPEAKER_01: David Sacks and Dresden Horowitz go to war with this founder, pinning all the blame on Parker Conrad.
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_01: And yeah, I'd say that was a moment where I was deeply skeptical of Sacks.
[00:03:39] SPEAKER_01: You know, he's sort of ruthless and prosecuting the case against Parker.
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_01: He brings in this guy, Lanny Davis, who is like real sort of, you know, DC fixer type, you know, lawyer PR guy.
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_01: Just to go to war against Parker, who's not not really equipped for to have, you know, all the powers.
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_01: It'd be a martial against him. And Sacks is just very, you know, lawyerly himself.
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_01: Couple other, you know, key facts. I mean, David Sacks literally Zenefits also crumbles under.
[00:04:13] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's not too well. Yeah, Sacks takes over. He doesn't save the company, you know, it's terrible.
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_01: You like passes it off to somebody else and the whole thing is a disaster.
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_01: So they certainly don't save the company by outing Parker.
[00:04:30] SPEAKER_01: To, you know, a couple other quick points on Sacks.
[00:04:33] SPEAKER_01: He writes a book with Peter Teal that says, you know, date rape isn't rape.
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_01: So he's somebody who's, you know, sort of conservative through and through.
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_01: He's one of the four besties on the all in podcast, so long with Chimoff, Pauli, Hapatia and Jason Calcanis and David Friedberg.
[00:04:56] SPEAKER_01: And he's a smug guy who thinks he's super smart.
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_01: I think in reality, he's made a bunch of money on Salana.
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_01: He's, you know, an investor.
[00:05:05] SPEAKER_01: He started this firm, Kraft Ventures that goes big on the cryptocurrency, Salana, which obviously is
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_01: known in the crypto world as sort of being an insider's insider sort of token.
[00:05:15] SPEAKER_01: And then when Trump gets elected, you know, he's supportive of the Republicans and Trump.
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_01: When Trump gets elected, he becomes Trump's AI and cryptos are while keeping a foot still still doing the
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_01: podcast frequently, still tied to his investment for, right?
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_01: So at Kraft, yeah, he hasn't divested from, I mean, he's, he's, you know, he doesn't divest.
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_01: He has, he's, he's claimed to have removed himself from some interests, but he has not left Kraft.
[00:05:42] He's a sort of free market capitalist type, type guy.
[00:05:46] SPEAKER_01: And so he's, you know, he's basically the industry guy that Trump brings in to boost AI and crypto and then New York
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_01: Times set off investigating him.
[00:05:57] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:05:58] SPEAKER_02: And I mean, you, this was a very objective, dispassionate for you, at least reading of David Sacks.
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_02: I mean, he has developed this, this persona and maybe it's just who he is.
[00:06:08] SPEAKER_02: I've never, I've never met the guy, but extremely unpleasant.
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_02: He likes to get in fights with people.
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_02: He's, he's extremely condescending, you know, very, um, triumphant list in, you know,
[00:06:19] SPEAKER_02: the way that they kind of, right.
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_02: Very late, uh, relatively late back Trump.
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_02: And you know, he, like the joke I would make is that he basically podcasted himself into an administration
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_02: appointment.
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:06:29] SPEAKER_02: Well, I think they tried, they would have preferred to Santis, but then once they realized this
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_01: Trump thing was going to happen again.
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_01: Right.
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_01: They got a fundraiser for him, get some as a guest on the all in podcast.
[00:06:40] SPEAKER_02: And then as the article points out, like, you know, they're able to use the podcast as a
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_02: business to kind of promote itself with the Trump administration.
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_02: I mean, Madeline, you were at the Hillin Valley conference, which gets mentioned in the New York Times
[00:06:52] SPEAKER_02: article.
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_02: I mean, that's an, that's an all in branded event.
[00:06:55] SPEAKER_02: More or less.
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_02: And Trump is like, you know, the, the, the guest of honor, right?
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_00: So I attended, uh, their, you know, AI summit that they hosted co hosted with Hillin Valley.
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_00: And an interesting anecdote in, um, the New York Times piece was, which I didn't realize at the
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_00: time was that the summit was actually just going to be hosted by all in.
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_00: And Susie Wiles thought that that was too deep of a, like a conflict of interest and
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_00: it looked great.
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_00: And so they had to scramble to find a more DC focused co host for this event.
[00:07:25] SPEAKER_00: So it wasn't just a two hour live podcast, which is what it was.
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_00: Or an all day podcast.
[00:07:29] SPEAKER_00: So they brought in the Hillin Valley guys that were known kind of tech government fixtures,
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_00: but more government leaning rather than tech leaning to make it seem legitimate,
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_00: which is quite funny.
[00:07:40] SPEAKER_00: But it was, it was a, you know, mingling of powerful people in government and different
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_00: secretaries like Secretary of Energy spoke, um, and they would just sit on the couch with
[00:07:53] SPEAKER_00: the besties.
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_00: And it was basically a live podcast.
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_00: That is what it was.
[00:07:57] SPEAKER_00: The thing about sacks that always bothered me before we even get into the article,
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_02: the, just as politics, which I think are reprehensible is that there,
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_02: there's so much phoniness and presentation with his whole persona.
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_02: I mean, this idea that he's just out there, like, like a clear man's Tucker Carl.
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_01: It's like sort of disingenuous.
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_01: He comes in with his like talking points on the podcast.
[00:08:21] SPEAKER_01: He eats up airtime like nobody, he tries to find foils.
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_01: It don't really seem prepared to go toe to toe with him.
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_01: Like, and, you know, he, also the all in dynamic is you've got David,
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_01: who's like partisan Republican, talking to talking points.
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_01: You've got David Friedberg who wants to talk science and say out of it.
[00:08:41] SPEAKER_01: You have Chimoff Palaiyabatiyya, who is, you know, total was a Democrat,
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_01: but clearly it was totally opportunistic.
[00:08:48] SPEAKER_01: And he's just trying to sort of grift every which way.
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_01: I've called him the scam in the arena.
[00:08:52] SPEAKER_01: And then you have Jason Galkanis, who I think at one point was sincerely
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_01: a Democrat, but like no, Democrat would hold him up is like, that's the guy.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_01: We want to really go toe to toe with David.
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_01: So David's sex just, you know, it's a handily as this forum.
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_01: Did you exactly?
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:09:08] SPEAKER_01: He's, yeah, he's, where it's like he's sort of the, you know, the guy.
[00:09:12] SPEAKER_01: He's a bee.
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_01: Yes.
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[00:09:15] SPEAKER_02: He represents the other side, but he's so hapless that you're just like, well,
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_02: they must be wrong then.
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_02: If that's, if that's the other, it's like a constant foil, you know, in the news letter.
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_01: Like, I mean, one of my more viral tweets was I said, like, I think honestly,
[00:09:28] SPEAKER_01: Tom, you ghostrode it for me, but before you worked for us, what, you know,
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_01: no libertarians in a bank run, no atheists in a fox hole, no libertarians in a bank run.
[00:09:37] SPEAKER_01: Like, you know, he's this ultimate libertarian.
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_01: And then the silk, silk on a valley bank is at risk of going under and sort of
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_01: screwing over Silicon Valley and all of a sudden all in and David's sacks are like
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_01: hysterical trying to get the government to step in.
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_01: And so it's like total self interested.
[00:09:54] SPEAKER_01: And, you know, I just read every one minor thing that sacks has been doing recently.
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_01: As he's been calling out the anthropic guys, I think this came up in our read
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_01: Hoffman episode that we just published.
[00:10:05] SPEAKER_01: He, you know, sacks says basically all the anthropic stuff is insincere and
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_01: that they're just trying to get government capture.
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_01: And I think Reed's point of view, my point of view was just that sacks is so
[00:10:17] SPEAKER_01: insincere in every point of view that he holds that he can't see somebody else offer a point of view
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_01: and say, oh, that's their actual perspective.
[00:10:24] SPEAKER_01: They think there might need to be a little regulation.
[00:10:27] SPEAKER_01: And so he just sees everything as some like, you know, cynical strategy.
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, even further than that, he is not divested from his firm and in the government
[00:10:38] SPEAKER_00: administration and is complaining about anthropic saying, hey, maybe we should have some regulation
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_00: about this. Like you're, you, you want it for your guys?
[00:10:46] SPEAKER_00: You know, you're in there.
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_00: You just don't want it to be unfettered.
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_00: It just felt kind of hypocritical.
[00:10:51] Yeah.
[00:10:51] And as a last bit of like insider, you know, insight into all of this, you know, when Mark Benioff
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_02: was getting in the news for asking for San Francisco to be ruled by martial law.
[00:11:04] SPEAKER_02: And you know, there was a big media cycle around that.
[00:11:07] SPEAKER_02: It was around the same time as Dreamforce was going on.
[00:11:09] SPEAKER_02: And Benioff has this big dinner at Dreamforce at the top of Salesforce.
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_02: Sorry, yeah, at the top of Salesforce tower.
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_02: David Sacks was there.
[00:11:16] SPEAKER_02: Dario from Anthropic was also there.
[00:11:18] SPEAKER_02: That got a little awkward.
[00:11:19] SPEAKER_02: Dario left before the dinner portion of the night.
[00:11:22] SPEAKER_02: So make of that, which you will.
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_02: But David Sacks was seated at the same table as Mark Benioff.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_02: And then the next day, David Sacks tweets out in defense of Benioff.
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_02: Hey, do you think about maybe joining the Republican party?
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_02: We'd love to have you.
[00:11:35] SPEAKER_02: As if there's some sort of authentic interaction where he's inviting him in.
[00:11:39] SPEAKER_02: Things are always less organic on Twitter than they seem.
[00:11:42] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, always less organic.
[00:11:44] Yeah, but he knew it would be provocative and stuff like that.
[00:11:46] SPEAKER_02: Anyway, so that's David Sacks.
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_02: I think we're all in agreement.
[00:11:48] SPEAKER_02: He's obnoxious.
[00:11:49] SPEAKER_02: We don't agree with his politics.
[00:11:51] SPEAKER_02: We have no desire to really defend him in any circumstance,
[00:11:54] SPEAKER_02: except, unfortunately, the New York Times is article.
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, here we go.
[00:12:01] Yeah, I mean, I don't know even where to start with this thing.
[00:12:04] SPEAKER_02: The attempt of the piece was to draw a connection between all of his holdings
[00:12:09] SPEAKER_02: with the policies that he's advocating for and saying this guy is like conflicted out the ass.
[00:12:13] SPEAKER_02: And I don't know.
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_02: It's just another sign of corruption in the Trump administration.
[00:12:19] SPEAKER_02: And I guess what I was really disappointed by, because I would have loved to see someone
[00:12:24] SPEAKER_02: take a huge crack at David Sacks, because I find him so obnoxious, is that like,
[00:12:29] there was nothing that they had in there that really was surprising to me.
[00:12:32] SPEAKER_02: We knew going into his appointment that this was a representative of Silicon Valley,
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_02: that the Trump administration was going to be a pro crypto administration.
[00:12:41] SPEAKER_02: That was very clear from from his from from Donald from junior.
[00:12:46] SPEAKER_02: You know, there was a lot of complaints around the Biden administration and kind of
[00:12:49] SPEAKER_02: honors regulation around AI and that wasn't going to be the case here.
[00:12:53] SPEAKER_02: And basically what the article is saying is like, well, because David Sacks holds
[00:12:57] SPEAKER_02: stakes in AI companies and AI startups, therefore he's conflicted and that's like informing his
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_02: like self enriching decisions.
[00:13:05] SPEAKER_02: And I mean, people went ballistic over the headline.
[00:13:08] SPEAKER_01: Silicon Valley's man in the White House is benefiting himself and his friends.
[00:13:12] SPEAKER_01: David Sacks, the Trump administration's AI and crypto's are has helped formulate policies
[00:13:17] SPEAKER_01: that aid his Silicon Valley friends and many of his own tech tech investments.
[00:13:20] SPEAKER_01: But it feels like the reality here is just like literally everything in tech is AI these days.
[00:13:26] SPEAKER_01: He's a tech investor. He's bullish on AI.
[00:13:28] SPEAKER_01: Therefore it helps him. I mean, it's almost as if he's it's like the guy's pro, you know,
[00:13:35] SPEAKER_01: AI and Nvidia is holding up the entire economy.
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_01: Therefore, you know, he's like helping himself.
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_01: It's like it's it's self-dealing only to the extent that New York Times has proven it.
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_01: It's just sort of like, yeah, he's generally pro the big thing in tech.
[00:13:50] SPEAKER_01: And he's like aligned with that.
[00:13:52] SPEAKER_01: But he doesn't have this sort of straight line corruption.
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_01: You know, the Trump administration said such a high bar for terrible self-dealing that this one
[00:14:03] SPEAKER_01: seems not not as exciting as just a Trump coin, you know, right?
[00:14:07] SPEAKER_01: We're so numb at this point to just the level of self-dealing in this administration that, you know,
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_00: just not fully divesting from your VC fund, you know, when you go into a special appointed position
[00:14:17] SPEAKER_00: is like that's small potatoes. But I will say one point in the story that I think we all, you know,
[00:14:22] SPEAKER_00: covering this space could pick apart a little bit was that their evidence of the self-dealing in part
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_00: was an analysis of all of the companies in crafts portfolio and how many of them were labeled as
[00:14:33] SPEAKER_00: AI companies and there were, you know, hundreds that were labeled as AI companies.
[00:14:36] SPEAKER_00: Every startup right now is an AI company. Every single one in their marketing materials is including
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_00: AI, even if, as we know, they're not really doing it. So just noting that their portfolio has a lot
[00:14:47] SPEAKER_00: of mentions of AI to me didn't feel like the smoking gun that maybe those of us who are already
[00:14:53] SPEAKER_00: not really primed to be on team David Sacks would be looking for.
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_00: Anybody who follows like my media criticism will know, you know, I just don't think this kind of
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_01: story makes sense anymore. Like I'd rather it as a screed against David Sacks from the man has
[00:15:09] SPEAKER_01: no ethics, I see answer everything bad in the world sort of what we're giving here, which is like
[00:15:14] SPEAKER_01: our perspective. But I think putting that perspective through the lens of like, you know,
[00:15:20] SPEAKER_01: view from nowhere, neutral news story, or he didn't play everything in a blind trust.
[00:15:25] SPEAKER_01: Right. That would be the way to kind of and previous presidents and administrations have done
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_02: that. But like we're just so far beyond that. Like we're dealing with the administration where
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_02: Cash Patel is using the FBI plane to travel to see his girlfriend sing the national anthem at
[00:15:39] SPEAKER_02: WWE events and going to like a literal boondoggle ranch. I mean, and those stories by the way do
[00:15:45] SPEAKER_02: have impact, you know, like there is discussion now about Cash Patel maybe being on the outs with
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_02: Trump. And I'm sure shit like this happens. So I don't even want to say like, oh, nothing,
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_02: you know, journalists write anymore have any effect. I mean, it's certainly it's harder.
[00:16:01] SPEAKER_02: But there are stories that do kind of affect these things. And yeah, I agree Eric like the sort of like
[00:16:08] SPEAKER_02: we laid out all the basically publicly available information in one narrative. And we want you to
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_02: be shocked and appalled by it. It just sort of doesn't register anymore. And then I really wish
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_02: that they could have pointed to specific policies that were like upsetting or controversial that only
[00:16:26] SPEAKER_02: came into existence because of his ties to, you know, the industry and his holdings and AI.
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_02: Right. It feels like just generic deregulation stuff. I mean, the most interesting thing is like
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_01: the interplay on China, but it doesn't go super deep on. Yeah, I wanted more about that because I
[00:16:43] SPEAKER_00: feel like, you know, Jensen has been co-seeing up so much to the Trump administration around
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_00: these chip deals to be allowed to still sell chips to China. That was a huge piece of the Hill
[00:16:53] SPEAKER_00: and Valley and all in event I went to was discussing this kind of policy. It seems like that is an
[00:17:00] SPEAKER_00: area that could have been really fruitful and there could have been more scoops or, you know,
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_00: deeper insights into what is driving the chip China policy. And if it's being entirely steered by,
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_00: you know, people who want to do business in China, even though it's unpopular with this party.
[00:17:17] SPEAKER_00: But that wasn't really there. Yeah. The last thing on this too is, is, you know, the one
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_02: or one policy or stance of the administration has taken that I think is a little more controversial
[00:17:29] SPEAKER_02: with AI is this belief that AI training should be allowed to train on any material that it wants to,
[00:17:37] SPEAKER_02: that you don't really need to worry about compensation of the original creators of this material,
[00:17:41] SPEAKER_02: because basically robots have the right to read or AI has the right to read. Which pits one
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_01: industry against another, right? It was like Hollywood publishing, carrying about copyright, Disney,
[00:17:52] SPEAKER_01: you know, versus tech, which doesn't. So in an administration ruled by big business,
[00:17:59] SPEAKER_01: it still could go either way. And obviously, sacks is on the side of tech here. Right. And, you know,
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_02: the courts are kind of mixed on which side they're going to fall on. And, you know, at some point,
[00:18:09] SPEAKER_02: this probably will get to the Supreme Court. The New York Times did not lean into that at all. And
[00:18:14] SPEAKER_02: I don't know if this is true, but it is a little bit concerning that New York Times also has a pending,
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_02: an ongoing lawsuit against open AI over this exact fact, or whether or not, you know, it illegally
[00:18:27] SPEAKER_02: trained on their articles. And, you know, I don't know if the reason it wasn't included is because of
[00:18:32] SPEAKER_02: that. They often disclose that in articles about open AI, you know, New York Times is sued in
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_02: open, you know, New York, anyway. But it just shows that like conflicts are sort of widely dispersed
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_02: these days. And it, you know, I guess the next part that we should get to is like the response,
[00:18:48] SPEAKER_02: which we talked about David Sacks, you called it a hoax and bullshit and they're spiraling. And
[00:18:52] SPEAKER_02: that's not even surprising. But you saw basically every major member of the tech community tweeting
[00:18:58] SPEAKER_02: out in support of David Sacks and how important he is. And I guess I'll Greg Brockman. I saw
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_02: Sam Altman. I saw, I don't know, there are any people that stuck out to you. Sam stuck out to me
[00:19:08] SPEAKER_00: in particular, given, you know, the back and forth there. But yeah, I was kind of it. It seemed
[00:19:13] SPEAKER_00: like they're the heavy hitters. It was everyone. It was every VC that, you know, has like a big
[00:19:17] SPEAKER_02: picture, which I thought the circling the wagons was more troubling than the New York Times story.
[00:19:24] SPEAKER_01: You know, it, it feels very much about how all these tech people are treating Trump, where it's
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_01: like you go to the dinners, you say only positive things about him. Like the, you know, when JD
[00:19:34] SPEAKER_01: Vance, when they were running for office, basically said he didn't see any separation between
[00:19:40] SPEAKER_01: big business and government. And like I feel like that this circling the wagons like, oh,
[00:19:46] SPEAKER_01: we all need to pay homage to David Sacks. That's honestly part of what's really worrying
[00:19:52] SPEAKER_01: with what this administration is doing. And so the sense that yeah, everybody needed to come and like
[00:19:59] but, you know, but kiss up to David Sacks over like a silly New York Times story. I mean,
[00:20:03] SPEAKER_01: it speaks, I mean, Tom, I think you were saying this earlier, but it speaks to the power of the New York
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_01: Times that they're all like obsessed about it. But yeah, I hated the circling the wagons.
[00:20:13] SPEAKER_01: I do have Sam's tweet if it's interesting to read. David Sacks really understands AI and cares
[00:20:18] SPEAKER_00: about the US leading an innovation. I am grateful we have him. So just very, I'm grateful we have him.
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_02: We're so grateful. We're so grateful. It's just very Tim Cook bringing, you know, gold to the
[00:20:30] SPEAKER_00: White House. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. But the one who continually, you know, disappoints me in all
[00:20:36] SPEAKER_02: of this is is Mark Benioff, who basically tweeted the same shit. His was a bit more specific to the
[00:20:42] SPEAKER_02: New York Times saying it was I'm reading his tweet now is a distortion of his leadership. And he
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_02: said it isn't journalism. It's almost strategic sabotage. Dude, you are the owner of Time magazine.
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_02: You're and something that you take very seriously. If you think that you want to, you know,
[00:20:58] SPEAKER_02: be a steward of journalism, you're going to have to deal with articles you don't disagree,
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_02: that you don't agree with. But to call it a sabotage and not journalism, just shows to me that
[00:21:07] SPEAKER_02: you're not a serious owner of a media company. You are most stories are way weaker. I mean,
[00:21:13] SPEAKER_01: this is just like it's a reasonable effort. You know, I didn't think that headline was that misleading.
[00:21:17] SPEAKER_01: I mean, it is helping him not in maybe the conspiratorial way you want. But yeah, it's a perfectly
[00:21:23] SPEAKER_01: fine story. Yeah, it didn't, you know, hit the mark for me and like it's easily defeated and
[00:21:29] SPEAKER_02: deconstructed in retrospect. But to say it's not journalism and then a strategic sabotage is
[00:21:36] SPEAKER_02: so antithetical to what an actual media owner who cares about journalism should be caring about,
[00:21:41] SPEAKER_02: that it completely undermines your credibility as that person. And like I think the last part
[00:21:47] SPEAKER_02: of this for me at least is like you see, you're still seeing texts circling the wagons around David
[00:21:51] SPEAKER_02: Sax, of course, but also Trump in general. And this is happening at a time that Trump's
[00:21:55] SPEAKER_02: disapproval ratings are record highs. It's not looking good for Trump right now. It's looking real
[00:22:00] SPEAKER_00: lame duck right now. Real lame duck. Yeah, yeah, Gallup, I think is like the worst it's ever been for him.
[00:22:05] SPEAKER_02: And for almost any president during their second term, there's a history of these things they
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_02: tend to get wiped out in the midterms. And they're basically like you said, Madeline, like a lame duck
[00:22:13] SPEAKER_02: for the rest of their administration. So everything that you were banking on this whole tech
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_02: Trump mega tech thing that is existed for the life. The whole thing could fly off the rails
[00:22:21] SPEAKER_02: in the next year. And everything that you have staked your reputation on could be gone. And so
[00:22:26] SPEAKER_02: really at this moment where you if you were smart might be thinking like, we should back away
[00:22:31] SPEAKER_02: because clearly these people don't have actual morals and closely held beliefs. So why don't
[00:22:36] SPEAKER_02: just lean into that and say, oh, looks like Trump isn't going to well right now. Maybe we should
[00:22:40] SPEAKER_02: back off and see how we can work with the potential Democratic House and maybe even Democratic Senate.
[00:22:45] SPEAKER_02: And said you're circling the wagon around David Sax, who is obnoxious. So you don't even really like
[00:22:49] SPEAKER_02: all that much and are now going to like be stuck with potentially 11 more months of effectiveness
[00:22:55] SPEAKER_02: from the Trump administration and then uselessness. But it just shows that these guys have no
[00:23:00] SPEAKER_02: not even like closely held beliefs and morals, but political instincts. Like the least you could
[00:23:04] SPEAKER_02: do is recognize the state of the fair. They're still in charge for like what three more years.
[00:23:09] SPEAKER_01: A lot, you know, maybe they're never going to leave office. You know, I don't know. Maybe they
[00:23:14] SPEAKER_01: know something we don't. But yeah, I wish that were the bet. I think there's just like we're
[00:23:18] SPEAKER_02: still betting on like a, you know, Democratic, yeah, fascism, authoritarian, autocracy. Yeah, we're just
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_02: still betting on a total of the bro. Yeah. Great. Just just be open about that. Thank you for tuning in
