[00:00:00] We're so numb at this point to just the level of self-dealing in this administration that, you know, just not fully divesting from your VC fund, you know, when you go into a special appointed position is like small potatoes.
[00:00:19] Welcome back to the newcomer podcast, Tom Doton here. I'm joined by Eric newcomer, Madeline Renbarger.
[00:00:24] Tom Doton: We're talking now about David Sacks, a man of many opinions, both his own and the way people feel about him. I'm excited to get into this one because we've got thoughts. And the reason David is in the news is the New York Times on Sunday of this week, I think it was Sunday put out a big piece, big expose. Man, I sound like Tucker Carlson when I said that. I don't want to load. I don't want to load it too much right now. They had an expose. It was apparently many months in the making where they were trying to fairly
[00:00:54] Tom Doton: deliberately show the conflicts of interest that David Sacks has as the AI and crypto's are to the Trump administration with his ongoing role as a venture capitalist. He is the thing managing partner at craft ventures.
[00:01:07] Tom Doton: And basically the story lays out that while in this role, he has been advocating for kind of maximalist AI policies that, you know, do not burden AI with a lot of regulation. And then same with crypto, probably even more so with crypto.
[00:01:22] Tom Doton: And he's also got these ongoing investments that are theoretically benefited by all of these policies. And just as like the last part of this recap, it was one of the article came out became a whole thing on Twitter. David Sacks called it a hit job in a hoax and said the New York Times was later spiraling and you had all these VCs and founders rushing to defend David Sacks saying how important he was to them and to their families and their children.
[00:01:50] Tom Doton: And really one of the great men of all time David Sacks. And then, you know, the reporters in the story, including Ryan Mac, who is known for getting into fights on Twitter. Very vocally defending the story. And it was all kind of a mess.
[00:02:05] Tom Doton: So that was my rundown of everything that happened over the last couple of days. But let's just start off with David Sacks, the guy, because he's been this figure for a long time. I mean, Eric, you were writing a lot about xenophets back in the day, which was the first time David Sacks seriously crossed my radar.
[00:02:20] Tom Doton: So I imagine you've been following the opinions about him for a while. I mean, what?
[00:02:25] Tom Doton: All right. So, you know, David Sacks, member of the PayPal Mafia, Confidant of Peter Teal. In some ways, the guy in the PayPal Mafia, who really did the work.
[00:02:36] Eric Newcomer: I mean, I think he was the chief operating officer. And so he was often the one like really, really grinding.
[00:02:42] Eric Newcomer: So he built this great network that includes some of the people circling the wagons for him after this New York Times story.
[00:02:49] Eric Newcomer: He found a sort of early version of Slack called Yammer that sells for a good bit of money.
[00:02:57] Eric Newcomer: It establishes him as a successful entrepreneur, though Yammer, which I believe purchased Microsoft.
[00:03:04] Eric Newcomer: Yeah, it doesn't last as like a product. I think feels like sort of a hollow exit.
[00:03:10] Eric Newcomer: You know, one of these sort of people make money. And then acquisition goes nowhere. Sort of deals.
[00:03:17] Eric Newcomer: Yeah, I got introduced to him in this fight over Zenefits, you know, Parker Conrad. Now the CEO of Ripley gets forced out.
[00:03:27] Eric Newcomer: David Sacks and Dresden Horowitz go to war with this founder, pinning all the blame on Parker Conrad.
[00:03:32] Eric Newcomer: And yeah, I'd say that was a moment where I was deeply skeptical of Sacks.
[00:03:39] Eric Newcomer: You know, he's sort of ruthless and prosecuting the case against Parker.
[00:03:45] Eric Newcomer: He brings in this guy, Lanny Davis, who is like real sort of, you know, DC fixer type, you know, lawyer PR guy.
[00:03:54] Eric Newcomer: Just to go to war against Parker, who's not not really equipped for to have, you know, all the powers.
[00:04:01] Eric Newcomer: It'd be a martial against him. And Sacks is just very, you know, lawyerly himself.
[00:04:08] Eric Newcomer: Couple other, you know, key facts. I mean, David Sacks literally Zenefits also crumbles under.
[00:04:13] Eric Newcomer: Yeah, it's not too well. Yeah, Sacks takes over. He doesn't save the company, you know, it's terrible.
[00:04:20] Eric Newcomer: You like passes it off to somebody else and the whole thing is a disaster.
[00:04:24] Eric Newcomer: So they certainly don't save the company by outing Parker.
[00:04:30] Eric Newcomer: To, you know, a couple other quick points on Sacks.
[00:04:33] Eric Newcomer: He writes a book with Peter Teal that says, you know, date rape isn't rape.
[00:04:41] Eric Newcomer: So he's somebody who's, you know, sort of conservative through and through.
[00:04:46] Eric Newcomer: He's one of the four besties on the all in podcast, so long with Chimoff, Pauli, Hapatia and Jason Calcanis and David Friedberg.
[00:04:56] Eric Newcomer: And he's a smug guy who thinks he's super smart.
[00:05:00] Eric Newcomer: I think in reality, he's made a bunch of money on Salana.
[00:05:03] Eric Newcomer: He's, you know, an investor.
[00:05:05] Eric Newcomer: He started this firm, Kraft Ventures that goes big on the cryptocurrency, Salana, which obviously is
[00:05:10] Eric Newcomer: known in the crypto world as sort of being an insider's insider sort of token.
[00:05:15] Eric Newcomer: And then when Trump gets elected, you know, he's supportive of the Republicans and Trump.
[00:05:19] Eric Newcomer: When Trump gets elected, he becomes Trump's AI and cryptos are while keeping a foot still still doing the
[00:05:27] Eric Newcomer: podcast frequently, still tied to his investment for, right?
[00:05:32] Eric Newcomer: So at Kraft, yeah, he hasn't divested from, I mean, he's, he's, you know, he doesn't divest.
[00:05:36] Eric Newcomer: He has, he's, he's claimed to have removed himself from some interests, but he has not left Kraft.
[00:05:42] He's a sort of free market capitalist type, type guy.
[00:05:46] Eric Newcomer: And so he's, you know, he's basically the industry guy that Trump brings in to boost AI and crypto and then New York
[00:05:55] Eric Newcomer: Times set off investigating him.
[00:05:57] Eric Newcomer: Yeah.
[00:05:58] Tom Doton: And I mean, you, this was a very objective, dispassionate for you, at least reading of David Sacks.
[00:06:04] Tom Doton: I mean, he has developed this, this persona and maybe it's just who he is.
[00:06:08] Tom Doton: I've never, I've never met the guy, but extremely unpleasant.
[00:06:11] Tom Doton: He likes to get in fights with people.
[00:06:13] Tom Doton: He's, he's extremely condescending, you know, very, um, triumphant list in, you know,
[00:06:19] Tom Doton: the way that they kind of, right.
[00:06:20] Tom Doton: Very late, uh, relatively late back Trump.
[00:06:23] Tom Doton: And you know, he, like the joke I would make is that he basically podcasted himself into an administration
[00:06:28] Tom Doton: appointment.
[00:06:28] Tom Doton: Right.
[00:06:29] Tom Doton: Well, I think they tried, they would have preferred to Santis, but then once they realized this
[00:06:33] Eric Newcomer: Trump thing was going to happen again.
[00:06:35] Eric Newcomer: Right.
[00:06:35] Eric Newcomer: They got a fundraiser for him, get some as a guest on the all in podcast.
[00:06:40] Tom Doton: And then as the article points out, like, you know, they're able to use the podcast as a
[00:06:44] Tom Doton: business to kind of promote itself with the Trump administration.
[00:06:48] Tom Doton: I mean, Madeline, you were at the Hillin Valley conference, which gets mentioned in the New York Times
[00:06:52] Tom Doton: article.
[00:06:53] Tom Doton: I mean, that's an, that's an all in branded event.
[00:06:55] Tom Doton: More or less.
[00:06:56] Tom Doton: And Trump is like, you know, the, the, the guest of honor, right?
[00:06:59] Tom Doton: Yeah.
[00:07:00] Madeline Renbarger: So I attended, uh, their, you know, AI summit that they hosted co hosted with Hillin Valley.
[00:07:05] Madeline Renbarger: And an interesting anecdote in, um, the New York Times piece was, which I didn't realize at the
[00:07:10] Madeline Renbarger: time was that the summit was actually just going to be hosted by all in.
[00:07:15] Madeline Renbarger: And Susie Wiles thought that that was too deep of a, like a conflict of interest and
[00:07:20] Madeline Renbarger: it looked great.
[00:07:20] Madeline Renbarger: And so they had to scramble to find a more DC focused co host for this event.
[00:07:25] Madeline Renbarger: So it wasn't just a two hour live podcast, which is what it was.
[00:07:28] Madeline Renbarger: Or an all day podcast.
[00:07:29] Madeline Renbarger: So they brought in the Hillin Valley guys that were known kind of tech government fixtures,
[00:07:34] Madeline Renbarger: but more government leaning rather than tech leaning to make it seem legitimate,
[00:07:39] Madeline Renbarger: which is quite funny.
[00:07:40] Madeline Renbarger: But it was, it was a, you know, mingling of powerful people in government and different
[00:07:48] Madeline Renbarger: secretaries like Secretary of Energy spoke, um, and they would just sit on the couch with
[00:07:53] Madeline Renbarger: the besties.
[00:07:54] Madeline Renbarger: And it was basically a live podcast.
[00:07:56] Madeline Renbarger: That is what it was.
[00:07:57] Madeline Renbarger: The thing about sacks that always bothered me before we even get into the article,
[00:08:02] Tom Doton: the, just as politics, which I think are reprehensible is that there,
[00:08:06] Tom Doton: there's so much phoniness and presentation with his whole persona.
[00:08:10] Tom Doton: I mean, this idea that he's just out there, like, like a clear man's Tucker Carl.
[00:08:16] Eric Newcomer: Yeah.
[00:08:16] Eric Newcomer: It's like sort of disingenuous.
[00:08:18] Eric Newcomer: He comes in with his like talking points on the podcast.
[00:08:21] Eric Newcomer: He eats up airtime like nobody, he tries to find foils.
[00:08:26] Eric Newcomer: It don't really seem prepared to go toe to toe with him.
[00:08:28] Eric Newcomer: Like, and, you know, he, also the all in dynamic is you've got David,
[00:08:34] Eric Newcomer: who's like partisan Republican, talking to talking points.
[00:08:38] Eric Newcomer: You've got David Friedberg who wants to talk science and say out of it.
[00:08:41] Eric Newcomer: You have Chimoff Palaiyabatiyya, who is, you know, total was a Democrat,
[00:08:46] Eric Newcomer: but clearly it was totally opportunistic.
[00:08:48] Eric Newcomer: And he's just trying to sort of grift every which way.
[00:08:50] Eric Newcomer: I've called him the scam in the arena.
[00:08:52] Eric Newcomer: And then you have Jason Galkanis, who I think at one point was sincerely
[00:08:56] Eric Newcomer: a Democrat, but like no, Democrat would hold him up is like, that's the guy.
[00:09:00] Eric Newcomer: We want to really go toe to toe with David.
[00:09:03] Eric Newcomer: So David's sex just, you know, it's a handily as this forum.
[00:09:06] Eric Newcomer: Did you exactly?
[00:09:07] Eric Newcomer: Yeah.
[00:09:08] Eric Newcomer: Yeah.
[00:09:08] Eric Newcomer: He's, yeah, he's, where it's like he's sort of the, you know, the guy.
[00:09:12] Eric Newcomer: He's a bee.
[00:09:13] Eric Newcomer: Yes.
[00:09:13] Eric Newcomer: Exactly.
[00:09:14] Eric Newcomer: Yeah.
[00:09:15] Tom Doton: He represents the other side, but he's so hapless that you're just like, well,
[00:09:18] Tom Doton: they must be wrong then.
[00:09:19] Tom Doton: Right.
[00:09:20] Tom Doton: If that's, if that's the other, it's like a constant foil, you know, in the news letter.
[00:09:24] Eric Newcomer: Like, I mean, one of my more viral tweets was I said, like, I think honestly,
[00:09:28] Eric Newcomer: Tom, you ghostrode it for me, but before you worked for us, what, you know,
[00:09:33] Eric Newcomer: no libertarians in a bank run, no atheists in a fox hole, no libertarians in a bank run.
[00:09:37] Eric Newcomer: Like, you know, he's this ultimate libertarian.
[00:09:39] Eric Newcomer: And then the silk, silk on a valley bank is at risk of going under and sort of
[00:09:44] Eric Newcomer: screwing over Silicon Valley and all of a sudden all in and David's sacks are like
[00:09:48] Eric Newcomer: hysterical trying to get the government to step in.
[00:09:51] Eric Newcomer: And so it's like total self interested.
[00:09:54] Eric Newcomer: And, you know, I just read every one minor thing that sacks has been doing recently.
[00:09:59] Eric Newcomer: As he's been calling out the anthropic guys, I think this came up in our read
[00:10:03] Eric Newcomer: Hoffman episode that we just published.
[00:10:05] Eric Newcomer: He, you know, sacks says basically all the anthropic stuff is insincere and
[00:10:11] Eric Newcomer: that they're just trying to get government capture.
[00:10:13] Eric Newcomer: And I think Reed's point of view, my point of view was just that sacks is so
[00:10:17] Eric Newcomer: insincere in every point of view that he holds that he can't see somebody else offer a point of view
[00:10:22] Eric Newcomer: and say, oh, that's their actual perspective.
[00:10:24] Eric Newcomer: They think there might need to be a little regulation.
[00:10:27] Eric Newcomer: And so he just sees everything as some like, you know, cynical strategy.
[00:10:32] Eric Newcomer: Yeah, even further than that, he is not divested from his firm and in the government
[00:10:38] Madeline Renbarger: administration and is complaining about anthropic saying, hey, maybe we should have some regulation
[00:10:42] Madeline Renbarger: about this. Like you're, you, you want it for your guys?
[00:10:46] Madeline Renbarger: You know, you're in there.
[00:10:47] Madeline Renbarger: You just don't want it to be unfettered.
[00:10:48] Madeline Renbarger: I don't know.
[00:10:49] Madeline Renbarger: It just felt kind of hypocritical.
[00:10:51] Yeah.
[00:10:51] And as a last bit of like insider, you know, insight into all of this, you know, when Mark Benioff
[00:10:58] Tom Doton: was getting in the news for asking for San Francisco to be ruled by martial law.
[00:11:04] Tom Doton: And you know, there was a big media cycle around that.
[00:11:07] Tom Doton: It was around the same time as Dreamforce was going on.
[00:11:09] Tom Doton: And Benioff has this big dinner at Dreamforce at the top of Salesforce.
[00:11:13] Tom Doton: Sorry, yeah, at the top of Salesforce tower.
[00:11:15] Tom Doton: David Sacks was there.
[00:11:16] Tom Doton: Dario from Anthropic was also there.
[00:11:18] Tom Doton: That got a little awkward.
[00:11:19] Tom Doton: Dario left before the dinner portion of the night.
[00:11:22] Tom Doton: So make of that, which you will.
[00:11:24] Tom Doton: But David Sacks was seated at the same table as Mark Benioff.
[00:11:28] Tom Doton: And then the next day, David Sacks tweets out in defense of Benioff.
[00:11:32] Tom Doton: Hey, do you think about maybe joining the Republican party?
[00:11:34] Tom Doton: We'd love to have you.
[00:11:35] Tom Doton: As if there's some sort of authentic interaction where he's inviting him in.
[00:11:39] Tom Doton: Things are always less organic on Twitter than they seem.
[00:11:42] Eric Newcomer: Yeah, always less organic.
[00:11:44] Yeah, but he knew it would be provocative and stuff like that.
[00:11:46] Tom Doton: Anyway, so that's David Sacks.
[00:11:47] Tom Doton: I think we're all in agreement.
[00:11:48] Tom Doton: He's obnoxious.
[00:11:49] Tom Doton: We don't agree with his politics.
[00:11:51] Tom Doton: We have no desire to really defend him in any circumstance,
[00:11:54] Tom Doton: except, unfortunately, the New York Times is article.
[00:11:58] Tom Doton: Yeah, here we go.
[00:12:01] Yeah, I mean, I don't know even where to start with this thing.
[00:12:04] Tom Doton: The attempt of the piece was to draw a connection between all of his holdings
[00:12:09] Tom Doton: with the policies that he's advocating for and saying this guy is like conflicted out the ass.
[00:12:13] Tom Doton: And I don't know.
[00:12:16] Tom Doton: It's just another sign of corruption in the Trump administration.
[00:12:19] Tom Doton: And I guess what I was really disappointed by, because I would have loved to see someone
[00:12:24] Tom Doton: take a huge crack at David Sacks, because I find him so obnoxious, is that like,
[00:12:29] there was nothing that they had in there that really was surprising to me.
[00:12:32] Tom Doton: We knew going into his appointment that this was a representative of Silicon Valley,
[00:12:38] Tom Doton: that the Trump administration was going to be a pro crypto administration.
[00:12:41] Tom Doton: That was very clear from from his from from Donald from junior.
[00:12:46] Tom Doton: You know, there was a lot of complaints around the Biden administration and kind of
[00:12:49] Tom Doton: honors regulation around AI and that wasn't going to be the case here.
[00:12:53] Tom Doton: And basically what the article is saying is like, well, because David Sacks holds
[00:12:57] Tom Doton: stakes in AI companies and AI startups, therefore he's conflicted and that's like informing his
[00:13:02] Tom Doton: like self enriching decisions.
[00:13:05] Tom Doton: And I mean, people went ballistic over the headline.
[00:13:08] Eric Newcomer: Silicon Valley's man in the White House is benefiting himself and his friends.
[00:13:12] Eric Newcomer: David Sacks, the Trump administration's AI and crypto's are has helped formulate policies
[00:13:17] Eric Newcomer: that aid his Silicon Valley friends and many of his own tech tech investments.
[00:13:20] Eric Newcomer: But it feels like the reality here is just like literally everything in tech is AI these days.
[00:13:26] Eric Newcomer: He's a tech investor. He's bullish on AI.
[00:13:28] Eric Newcomer: Therefore it helps him. I mean, it's almost as if he's it's like the guy's pro, you know,
[00:13:35] Eric Newcomer: AI and Nvidia is holding up the entire economy.
[00:13:38] Eric Newcomer: Therefore, you know, he's like helping himself.
[00:13:40] Eric Newcomer: It's like it's it's self-dealing only to the extent that New York Times has proven it.
[00:13:46] Eric Newcomer: It's just sort of like, yeah, he's generally pro the big thing in tech.
[00:13:50] Eric Newcomer: And he's like aligned with that.
[00:13:52] Eric Newcomer: But he doesn't have this sort of straight line corruption.
[00:13:56] Eric Newcomer: You know, the Trump administration said such a high bar for terrible self-dealing that this one
[00:14:03] Eric Newcomer: seems not not as exciting as just a Trump coin, you know, right?
[00:14:07] Eric Newcomer: We're so numb at this point to just the level of self-dealing in this administration that, you know,
[00:14:12] Madeline Renbarger: just not fully divesting from your VC fund, you know, when you go into a special appointed position
[00:14:17] Madeline Renbarger: is like that's small potatoes. But I will say one point in the story that I think we all, you know,
[00:14:22] Madeline Renbarger: covering this space could pick apart a little bit was that their evidence of the self-dealing in part
[00:14:27] Madeline Renbarger: was an analysis of all of the companies in crafts portfolio and how many of them were labeled as
[00:14:33] Madeline Renbarger: AI companies and there were, you know, hundreds that were labeled as AI companies.
[00:14:36] Madeline Renbarger: Every startup right now is an AI company. Every single one in their marketing materials is including
[00:14:41] Madeline Renbarger: AI, even if, as we know, they're not really doing it. So just noting that their portfolio has a lot
[00:14:47] Madeline Renbarger: of mentions of AI to me didn't feel like the smoking gun that maybe those of us who are already
[00:14:53] Madeline Renbarger: not really primed to be on team David Sacks would be looking for.
[00:14:57] Madeline Renbarger: Anybody who follows like my media criticism will know, you know, I just don't think this kind of
[00:15:01] Eric Newcomer: story makes sense anymore. Like I'd rather it as a screed against David Sacks from the man has
[00:15:09] Eric Newcomer: no ethics, I see answer everything bad in the world sort of what we're giving here, which is like
[00:15:14] Eric Newcomer: our perspective. But I think putting that perspective through the lens of like, you know,
[00:15:20] Eric Newcomer: view from nowhere, neutral news story, or he didn't play everything in a blind trust.
[00:15:25] Eric Newcomer: Right. That would be the way to kind of and previous presidents and administrations have done
[00:15:30] Tom Doton: that. But like we're just so far beyond that. Like we're dealing with the administration where
[00:15:34] Tom Doton: Cash Patel is using the FBI plane to travel to see his girlfriend sing the national anthem at
[00:15:39] Tom Doton: WWE events and going to like a literal boondoggle ranch. I mean, and those stories by the way do
[00:15:45] Tom Doton: have impact, you know, like there is discussion now about Cash Patel maybe being on the outs with
[00:15:51] Tom Doton: Trump. And I'm sure shit like this happens. So I don't even want to say like, oh, nothing,
[00:15:55] Tom Doton: you know, journalists write anymore have any effect. I mean, it's certainly it's harder.
[00:16:01] Tom Doton: But there are stories that do kind of affect these things. And yeah, I agree Eric like the sort of like
[00:16:08] Tom Doton: we laid out all the basically publicly available information in one narrative. And we want you to
[00:16:13] Tom Doton: be shocked and appalled by it. It just sort of doesn't register anymore. And then I really wish
[00:16:20] Tom Doton: that they could have pointed to specific policies that were like upsetting or controversial that only
[00:16:26] Tom Doton: came into existence because of his ties to, you know, the industry and his holdings and AI.
[00:16:31] Tom Doton: Right. It feels like just generic deregulation stuff. I mean, the most interesting thing is like
[00:16:37] Eric Newcomer: the interplay on China, but it doesn't go super deep on. Yeah, I wanted more about that because I
[00:16:43] Madeline Renbarger: feel like, you know, Jensen has been co-seeing up so much to the Trump administration around
[00:16:48] Madeline Renbarger: these chip deals to be allowed to still sell chips to China. That was a huge piece of the Hill
[00:16:53] Madeline Renbarger: and Valley and all in event I went to was discussing this kind of policy. It seems like that is an
[00:17:00] Madeline Renbarger: area that could have been really fruitful and there could have been more scoops or, you know,
[00:17:05] Madeline Renbarger: deeper insights into what is driving the chip China policy. And if it's being entirely steered by,
[00:17:12] Madeline Renbarger: you know, people who want to do business in China, even though it's unpopular with this party.
[00:17:17] Madeline Renbarger: But that wasn't really there. Yeah. The last thing on this too is, is, you know, the one
[00:17:24] Tom Doton: or one policy or stance of the administration has taken that I think is a little more controversial
[00:17:29] Tom Doton: with AI is this belief that AI training should be allowed to train on any material that it wants to,
[00:17:37] Tom Doton: that you don't really need to worry about compensation of the original creators of this material,
[00:17:41] Tom Doton: because basically robots have the right to read or AI has the right to read. Which pits one
[00:17:47] Eric Newcomer: industry against another, right? It was like Hollywood publishing, carrying about copyright, Disney,
[00:17:52] Eric Newcomer: you know, versus tech, which doesn't. So in an administration ruled by big business,
[00:17:59] Eric Newcomer: it still could go either way. And obviously, sacks is on the side of tech here. Right. And, you know,
[00:18:05] Tom Doton: the courts are kind of mixed on which side they're going to fall on. And, you know, at some point,
[00:18:09] Tom Doton: this probably will get to the Supreme Court. The New York Times did not lean into that at all. And
[00:18:14] Tom Doton: I don't know if this is true, but it is a little bit concerning that New York Times also has a pending,
[00:18:20] Tom Doton: an ongoing lawsuit against open AI over this exact fact, or whether or not, you know, it illegally
[00:18:27] Tom Doton: trained on their articles. And, you know, I don't know if the reason it wasn't included is because of
[00:18:32] Tom Doton: that. They often disclose that in articles about open AI, you know, New York Times is sued in
[00:18:36] Tom Doton: open, you know, New York, anyway. But it just shows that like conflicts are sort of widely dispersed
[00:18:42] Tom Doton: these days. And it, you know, I guess the next part that we should get to is like the response,
[00:18:48] Tom Doton: which we talked about David Sacks, you called it a hoax and bullshit and they're spiraling. And
[00:18:52] Tom Doton: that's not even surprising. But you saw basically every major member of the tech community tweeting
[00:18:58] Tom Doton: out in support of David Sacks and how important he is. And I guess I'll Greg Brockman. I saw
[00:19:04] Tom Doton: Sam Altman. I saw, I don't know, there are any people that stuck out to you. Sam stuck out to me
[00:19:08] Madeline Renbarger: in particular, given, you know, the back and forth there. But yeah, I was kind of it. It seemed
[00:19:13] Madeline Renbarger: like they're the heavy hitters. It was everyone. It was every VC that, you know, has like a big
[00:19:17] Tom Doton: picture, which I thought the circling the wagons was more troubling than the New York Times story.
[00:19:24] Eric Newcomer: You know, it, it feels very much about how all these tech people are treating Trump, where it's
[00:19:29] Eric Newcomer: like you go to the dinners, you say only positive things about him. Like the, you know, when JD
[00:19:34] Eric Newcomer: Vance, when they were running for office, basically said he didn't see any separation between
[00:19:40] Eric Newcomer: big business and government. And like I feel like that this circling the wagons like, oh,
[00:19:46] Eric Newcomer: we all need to pay homage to David Sacks. That's honestly part of what's really worrying
[00:19:52] Eric Newcomer: with what this administration is doing. And so the sense that yeah, everybody needed to come and like
[00:19:59] but, you know, but kiss up to David Sacks over like a silly New York Times story. I mean,
[00:20:03] Eric Newcomer: it speaks, I mean, Tom, I think you were saying this earlier, but it speaks to the power of the New York
[00:20:08] Eric Newcomer: Times that they're all like obsessed about it. But yeah, I hated the circling the wagons.
[00:20:13] Eric Newcomer: I do have Sam's tweet if it's interesting to read. David Sacks really understands AI and cares
[00:20:18] Madeline Renbarger: about the US leading an innovation. I am grateful we have him. So just very, I'm grateful we have him.
[00:20:25] Tom Doton: We're so grateful. We're so grateful. It's just very Tim Cook bringing, you know, gold to the
[00:20:30] Madeline Renbarger: White House. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. But the one who continually, you know, disappoints me in all
[00:20:36] Tom Doton: of this is is Mark Benioff, who basically tweeted the same shit. His was a bit more specific to the
[00:20:42] Tom Doton: New York Times saying it was I'm reading his tweet now is a distortion of his leadership. And he
[00:20:47] Tom Doton: said it isn't journalism. It's almost strategic sabotage. Dude, you are the owner of Time magazine.
[00:20:53] Tom Doton: You're and something that you take very seriously. If you think that you want to, you know,
[00:20:58] Tom Doton: be a steward of journalism, you're going to have to deal with articles you don't disagree,
[00:21:02] Tom Doton: that you don't agree with. But to call it a sabotage and not journalism, just shows to me that
[00:21:07] Tom Doton: you're not a serious owner of a media company. You are most stories are way weaker. I mean,
[00:21:13] Eric Newcomer: this is just like it's a reasonable effort. You know, I didn't think that headline was that misleading.
[00:21:17] Eric Newcomer: I mean, it is helping him not in maybe the conspiratorial way you want. But yeah, it's a perfectly
[00:21:23] Eric Newcomer: fine story. Yeah, it didn't, you know, hit the mark for me and like it's easily defeated and
[00:21:29] Tom Doton: deconstructed in retrospect. But to say it's not journalism and then a strategic sabotage is
[00:21:36] Tom Doton: so antithetical to what an actual media owner who cares about journalism should be caring about,
[00:21:41] Tom Doton: that it completely undermines your credibility as that person. And like I think the last part
[00:21:47] Tom Doton: of this for me at least is like you see, you're still seeing texts circling the wagons around David
[00:21:51] Tom Doton: Sax, of course, but also Trump in general. And this is happening at a time that Trump's
[00:21:55] Tom Doton: disapproval ratings are record highs. It's not looking good for Trump right now. It's looking real
[00:22:00] Madeline Renbarger: lame duck right now. Real lame duck. Yeah, yeah, Gallup, I think is like the worst it's ever been for him.
[00:22:05] Tom Doton: And for almost any president during their second term, there's a history of these things they
[00:22:09] Tom Doton: tend to get wiped out in the midterms. And they're basically like you said, Madeline, like a lame duck
[00:22:13] Tom Doton: for the rest of their administration. So everything that you were banking on this whole tech
[00:22:16] Tom Doton: Trump mega tech thing that is existed for the life. The whole thing could fly off the rails
[00:22:21] Tom Doton: in the next year. And everything that you have staked your reputation on could be gone. And so
[00:22:26] Tom Doton: really at this moment where you if you were smart might be thinking like, we should back away
[00:22:31] Tom Doton: because clearly these people don't have actual morals and closely held beliefs. So why don't
[00:22:36] Tom Doton: just lean into that and say, oh, looks like Trump isn't going to well right now. Maybe we should
[00:22:40] Tom Doton: back off and see how we can work with the potential Democratic House and maybe even Democratic Senate.
[00:22:45] Tom Doton: And said you're circling the wagon around David Sax, who is obnoxious. So you don't even really like
[00:22:49] Tom Doton: all that much and are now going to like be stuck with potentially 11 more months of effectiveness
[00:22:55] Tom Doton: from the Trump administration and then uselessness. But it just shows that these guys have no
[00:23:00] Tom Doton: not even like closely held beliefs and morals, but political instincts. Like the least you could
[00:23:04] Tom Doton: do is recognize the state of the fair. They're still in charge for like what three more years.
[00:23:09] Eric Newcomer: A lot, you know, maybe they're never going to leave office. You know, I don't know. Maybe they
[00:23:14] Eric Newcomer: know something we don't. But yeah, I wish that were the bet. I think there's just like we're
[00:23:18] Tom Doton: still betting on like a, you know, Democratic, yeah, fascism, authoritarian, autocracy. Yeah, we're just
[00:23:23] Tom Doton: still betting on a total of the bro. Yeah. Great. Just just be open about that. Thank you for tuning in
