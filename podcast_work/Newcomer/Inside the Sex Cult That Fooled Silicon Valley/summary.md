# Podcast Summary: Empire of Orgasms - Ellen Huet on OneTaste

## 1. Key Themes

### The Convergence of Wellness Capitalism and Startup Culture in San Francisco

OneTaste successfully bridged San Francisco's spiritual/new-age culture with 2010s startup capitalism, creating a business model that felt native to the era. Ellen Huet explains: "There was this sense that they were tapping into some of the ethos that was also really popular in San Francisco in the 2010s...people were exploring polyamory, people were doing biohacking. All of a sudden a practice that is a 15 minute hack to a better life, it doesn't sound so out of place" [[00:07:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=7m25s). The company had a mission statement "to bring capital O orgasm to a billion people" [[00:06:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=5m50s), mirroring WeWork's mission to "elevate the world's consciousness." They gave TEDx talks, spoke at South by Southwest, hosted conferences with lanyards reading "agent of orgasm" that looked like developer conferences, and received endorsements from Tim Ferriss [[00:07:56]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=7m46s).

### The Evolution of Modern Cults to Mirror Contemporary Values

Cults have adapted to reflect what society currently values, making them harder to recognize. Huet notes: "Cults adapt with the times. This is one of the most interesting things that I learned while researching this book is that they are constantly changing to reflect what people value, what people look at, what feels current" [[00:13:40]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=13m30s). Researchers told her "we expect that in the future more than in the past, cult leaders might be women or that they might have a presence that is very online or that they might reach new followers through Instagram or have YouTube seminars" [[00:13:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=13m47s). OneTaste represented a new model: commercial, female-led, wellness-focused, and startup-branded rather than the stereotypical "bearded man on a rural homestead" [[00:13:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=13m15s).

### Sexual Coercion Wrapped in Spiritual Philosophy and Sales Performance

OneTaste uniquely blended spiritual teachings with business metrics, using sexual energy as both the product and the mechanism of control. Huet discovered: "Many people told me that sales workers were often chastised if they weren't hitting their sales goals, but they would be told that it's not because they were asking the wrong questions or going after the wrong customers. It was because their orgasmic energy was blocked up" [[00:14:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=14m38s). The solution prescribed was often that managers would tell employees "you need to go have sex with someone or you need to go have sex with your coworker. If two coworkers were disputing, people told me that they were sometimes instructed to go home together or have sex with each other as a way of like unblocking this sexual energy" [[00:15:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=14m53s).

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### Female-Founded Companies Can Exploit the "Girlboss" Era Just as Harmfully as Male-Led Ones

While the 2010s celebrated female founders and the "girlboss" phenomenon, OneTaste demonstrates that female leadership doesn't inherently prevent exploitation. Huet explains: "There was also this desire to see female founders at the top of fast growing startups...Girlboss, like there was just this energy that propelled the company, which was this mix of wellness startups, female empowerment, female leaders" [[00:09:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=9m16s). Nicole Daydon used her position as a female founder promoting female pleasure to build a system that ultimately exploited both male and female employees sexually and financially.

### The Mystification of Female Sexuality Creates Vulnerability to Exploitation

The cultural tendency to treat female orgasm as mysterious and spiritually significant, rather than biological, creates unique opportunities for manipulation. OneTaste capitalized on the fact that "sexuality is for a lot of people this puzzle...maybe they're one of the estimated 10 to 15% of American women who struggle to have an orgasm" [[00:22:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=22m16s). Huet notes: "There are very few places where you can go to talk about them. OneTaste was one of the few places that was really putting up the banner and saying we will have straightforward, like really direct conversations about your sex life and we have a promise that doing this practice...is going to help" [[00:23:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=22m50s). This scarcity of resources made people more vulnerable.

### Extreme Personal Growth Philosophies Are Inherently Risky, Regardless of Business Model

The core problem wasn't capitalism itself, but Nicole's belief that "she experienced what she believes as personal growth through extreme experiences, sexual and otherwise, like she also has talked about taking lots of drugs, taking lots of LSD in her past and she believed that this form of pursuing personal growth worked for her and should work for other people" [[00:28:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=28m0s). Huet argues: "The culture within OneTaste was infused with this sense that extreme experiences and intensity were going to bring you personal growth and for some people that was true and it was helpful and for some people I think it led to really harmful places" [[00:28:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=28m20s).

## 3. Companies Identified

### **OneTaste**
**Description:** A sexual wellness company founded in San Francisco in 2004 that taught "orgasmic meditation" (OM) - a 15-minute partnered practice involving clitoral stroking. At its peak, generated $12 million in annual revenue.

**Why Mentioned:** Central subject of the book. Founders Nicole Daydon and second-in-command were convicted of forced labor conspiracy and are currently in jail in Brooklyn awaiting sentencing [[00:04:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=4m13s).

**Notable Quote:** "OneTaste was a company that was started in San Francisco in 2004 by a woman named Nicole Daydon. And it grew fairly mainstream. Despite the fact that its main business was selling courses on a sexual spiritual practice called orgasmic meditation" [[00:03:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=2m54s).

### **Singularity University**
**Description:** Educational institution focused on futuristic and exponential technologies.

**Why Mentioned:** Reese Jones, OneTaste's primary investor/funder, "later became involved with Singularity University. He was very interested in esoteric topics and the Singularity and science and things like that" [[00:16:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=16m39s).

## 4. People Identified

### **Tim Ferriss**
**Description:** Author and entrepreneur known for productivity hacking and peak performance optimization.

**Why Mentioned:** Endorsed OneTaste, lending mainstream credibility. "They even got endorsed by Tim Ferris, who of course is kind of like a hero to a lot of people in tech who are looking for peak performance, whether that's mental or physical" [[00:08:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=7m54s).

### **Gwyneth Paltrow**
**Description:** Actress and founder of Goop wellness empire.

**Why Mentioned:** Provided crucial wellness industry endorsement. "Of course, they managed to get that clinch that most important endorsement. Gwyneth is the queen of wellness alternative therapies" [[00:09:06]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=8m56s).

### **Nicole Daydon**
**Description:** Founder of OneTaste who previously had extensive experience with LSD and extreme personal growth methods.

**Why Mentioned:** Built the company and ideology. Sold her stake in 2017 for approximately $12 million before federal prosecution. "Nicole is an interesting and fascinating character and my read of her to some extent is that she experienced what she believes as personal growth through extreme experiences, sexual and otherwise" [[00:28:02]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=27m52s).

### **Reese Jones**
**Description:** Venture capitalist who sold a company to Motorola in the early 2000s for about $200 million.

**Why Mentioned:** Primary financial backer of OneTaste who received sexual services from employees in exchange for funding. "According to court testimony, were themed after things like the seven deadly sins or the Wizard of Oz. And he was also arranged to have a sexual handler, someone who...would live with him, take care of some household tasks, maybe take care of his dog, and then sexually service him every day" [[00:17:33]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=17m23s).

## 5. Operating Insights

### The Dangerous Fusion of Spiritual Philosophy and Sales Metrics

Companies that blend spiritual teachings with business KPIs create unique pressure that can lead to abuse. When spiritual progress becomes tied to sales performance, it creates a mechanism where failure to hit targets becomes redefined as personal spiritual failure requiring extreme corrective measures. This was manifested at OneTaste when employees not hitting sales goals were told "it's not because they were asking the wrong questions or going after the wrong customers. It was because their orgasmic energy was blocked up" [[00:14:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=14m38s).

### Female Empowerment Branding Can Mask Exploitative Structures

The "girlboss" era and focus on female founders in the 2010s created opportunities for exploitation under the guise of empowerment. OneTaste sold "a radically female focused, pleasure practice. We don't have a lot of those. There was this commendable desire to kind of correct what they saw as an unfair focus on male pleasure in sex" [[00:23:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=23m45s), yet this framing ultimately enabled a system where both male and female employees were sexually exploited.

### Post-Economic Freedom Creates Unique Risk Profiles

When individuals have enough wealth to be "post-economic," they gain freedom to pursue interests without normal market constraints, which can enable harmful behaviors. As discussed regarding Reese Jones and the "archipelago of Deca millionaires and maybe some centimillionaires in the Bay Area" [[00:20:02]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=19m52s), having substantial but not headline-grabbing wealth ($200 million range) provides enough resources to fund elaborate schemes while remaining below public scrutiny.

## 6. Overlooked Insights

### The Secularization Crisis Creates a Competitive Market for Meaning

One of the most profound but briefly mentioned insights came from a former cult member who now helps people leave high-demand groups. When asked what would help society, "she said, I really wish I could just bring back healthy religion. Like she was like, if more people were religious, we would have lots of this risk" [[00:33:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=33m37s). This reveals that the proliferation of groups like OneTaste, SoulCycle, and others isn't just about individual vulnerability—it's a systemic response to the collapse of traditional meaning-making institutions. The lack of a "church replacement that sort of covers the same ground" [[00:33:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=33m16s) has created a fragmented marketplace where commercial entities compete to fill spiritual voids, often inadequately or exploitatively.

### The Payments Infrastructure Gap in Sexual Wellness Creates Market Distortions

Huet briefly mentions that "sexuality, it's a tough business and you'll probably struggle to get banked by and deal with payments and stuff" [[00:24:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbq5NCVl_0&t=24m42s). This throwaway comment reveals a significant structural barrier: legitimate sexual wellness businesses face banking and payment processing discrimination, which may have pushed OneTaste toward alternative funding models (like Reese Jones's arrangement) and prevented more legitimate competitors from entering the market. This infrastructure gap may inadvertently enable exploitative business models by limiting access to conventional capital and payment systems.
