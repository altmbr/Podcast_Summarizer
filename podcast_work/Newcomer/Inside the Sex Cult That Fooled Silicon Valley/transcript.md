[00:00:00] Many people told me that sales workers were often chastised if they weren't hitting their
[00:00:04] Ellen Huet: sales goals, but they would be told that it's not because they were asking the wrong questions
[00:00:08] Ellen Huet: or going after the wrong customers. It was because their orgasmic energy was blocked up.
[00:00:20] Welcome back to the newcomer podcast. I'm Madeline here with my co-hosts Eric and Tom,
[00:00:25] Madeline: and we're joined by Ellen Hewitt from Bloomberg to talk about her latest book, which just
[00:00:30] Madeline: published, what was it, two weeks ago? Two weeks ago. When you look at the store,
[00:00:34] Madeline: Empire of Orgasms, Sex, Power, and the Downfall of a Wellness Cult. So,
[00:00:39] Madeline: salacious topic for the newcomer podcast. Ready to dive in. Ellen, welcome to the show.
[00:00:43] Madeline: Thanks so much for having me. I want to quickly say before we jump into questions, Ellen. I
[00:00:48] Eric: remember going to Eric's wedding, I think the last time or one of the last times you and I hung out,
[00:00:52] Eric: which is sad, it's been that long. You were deep in the throws of working on the book.
[00:00:59] Eric: You were barely conscious, I felt. Things were intense for you. That was 2023. Yeah.
[00:01:08] Eric: 2022 and 2023 were, I would say, a moral low point for the book process, but overall, a very
[00:01:18] Ellen Huet: satisfying and rewarding and creatively challenging experience. If anyone ever wants tips on how to
[00:01:23] Ellen Huet: manage the sole aspect of writing a book, I can give you tips on that. Just hit me up. Yeah.
[00:01:31] Ellen Huet: And Ellen was my deskmate at Bloomberg when you first wrote the Business Week feature that
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_04: took us to the salon. That is right. Eric and I used to sit right next to each other. And as I
[00:01:41] Ellen Huet: like to tell people, he spoke so loudly while on the phone that if I happened to be on a phone
[00:01:47] Ellen Huet: call at the same time as he thought that Eric had joined our phone call. They were like,
[00:01:51] Ellen Huet: why is there a third person on our call? I thought it was just us. I'm like, no, no. It's my desk
[00:01:56] Ellen Huet: neighbor. I'll move. Who built an open office for the private active report? I was calling.
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_04: I know. I blamed Bloomberg on that one. And anyway, I can relate to this too, Ellen quickly.
[00:02:09] Eric: When Eric and I work together at the information one time, he sneezed and the guy on the other
[00:02:12] Eric: side of the line said, bless you. That is 100% checks out. I want to be heard. He's expressive.
[00:02:21] SPEAKER_04: He's expressive. Well, we're excited to see all of that come to come to his
[00:02:27] SPEAKER_04: culmination. Yes. culmination with this book. So people haven't followed this closely. Don't know
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_04: the whole story. There's so much to it. But give this huge level. Yeah. Totally. Yeah. So I spent
[00:02:38] Ellen Huet: the last five years, you know, I've been I have been an AMA reporter at Bloomberg. I'm a
[00:02:44] Ellen Huet: features writer. I write about tech and AI and Silicon Valley. But at the same time in my
[00:02:50] Ellen Huet: nights and weekends, I have been spending the last five years working on this book. I'm
[00:02:53] Ellen Huet: proud of orgasm, which, you know, chronicles the rise and fall of this sex wellness cult
[00:03:00] Ellen Huet: called one taste. And one taste was a company that was started in San Francisco in 2004 by a
[00:03:04] Ellen Huet: woman named Nicole Daydon. And it grew fairly mainstream. Despite the fact that its main business
[00:03:12] Ellen Huet: was selling courses on a sexual spiritual practice called orgasmic meditation, also known as
[00:03:19] Ellen Huet: OM or OM. And orgasmic meditation is a 15 minute partnered, literal stroking meditative practice
[00:03:27] Ellen Huet: in which a stoker, usually a man who remains fully clothed puts a glove on his left hand and
[00:03:33] Ellen Huet: some blue on his left index finger and strokes the clitoris of a woman who is naked only from
[00:03:36] Ellen Huet: the waist down for 15 minutes exactly. And the goal of the experiences for both parties to simply
[00:03:43] Ellen Huet: meditate on the sensations in their bodies during those 15 minutes. And that's it. And this practice
[00:03:48] Ellen Huet: OM was promised, you know, if you were a regular practitioner, it was promised that you would not
[00:03:53] Ellen Huet: only have better sex, better relationships, better connection and intimacy with other human beings.
[00:03:59] Ellen Huet: But also that if you delve more deeply in the practice that you might experience a better sense
[00:04:04] Ellen Huet: of your intuition and your desire and maybe even a connection to the spiritual or the divine
[00:04:09] Ellen Huet: erotic energy that apparently is in the world all around us. And then, you know, fast forward to
[00:04:16] Ellen Huet: today, the leader and the second command of this group have actually been indicted by the feds
[00:04:23] Ellen Huet: and were convicted in a criminal jury trial this summer in New York and are currently in
[00:04:30] Ellen Huet: jail in Brooklyn for forced labor conspiracy, which we could get into, but it's kind of a specific
[00:04:36] Ellen Huet: federal charge and are currently in jail in Brooklyn awaiting sentencing, which will probably come
[00:04:42] Ellen Huet: early next year. There's your afterward. I mean, there's so much to dive into with this topic,
[00:04:49] Eric: but I kind of actually want to start off with just you as a reporter on this because you've been
[00:04:54] Eric: a startups reporter, at least while you've been a Bloomberg and think before that you were at
[00:04:58] Eric: the Chronicle and we're like a crime reporter. Yeah, and I worked at Forbes for a brief stint too,
[00:05:03] Ellen Huet: but yeah, I was breaking using crime reporter at the Chronicle. Yeah, but coming to this story,
[00:05:09] Eric: which, you know, you really do tie up into the history of cults and wellness in the Bay Area,
[00:05:15] Eric: but also startup culture. I mean, specific to the startup side of things, like why do you
[00:05:20] Eric: was this a startup story? Like, how is this wrapped into the kind of Bay Area business community
[00:05:26] Eric: and the mentality of people who kind of flock here for the very specific reasons that the Bay Area is,
[00:05:31] Eric: you know, a startup world? Yeah, I both recognize that it looks different than a lot of startups,
[00:05:38] Ellen Huet: and you know, I'm certainly not pretending it's exactly the same as them, but there are some striking
[00:05:43] Ellen Huet: similarities like Nicole really decided that the way to spread the mission and the message of
[00:05:50] Ellen Huet: this sexual practice that she believed in was not by starting like a media company or a nonprofit,
[00:05:55] Ellen Huet: it was by starting a for-profit business that was going to proselytize this thing. And at one
[00:06:00] Ellen Huet: point, one taste had the business mission statement of to bring capital O orgasm to a billion people,
[00:06:09] Ellen Huet: to be clear, they redefine orgasm to mean more like a broadly defined, erotic energy, but nevertheless,
[00:06:15] Ellen Huet: the mission statement to bring orgasm to a billion people. And it doesn't feel out of place if you
[00:06:19] Ellen Huet: remember the era of the WeWork mission statement to elevate the world's consciousness or these things
[00:06:25] Ellen Huet: that, you know, you might you might laugh at it, but they were really in the water in the 2010s.
[00:06:30] Well, it's very Silicon Valley season one. It's very Silicon Valley season one. We are making the
[00:06:35] Madeline: world a better place through B2S. They are. But yeah, in this case, actually much more of a spiritual
[00:06:40] Madeline: physical practice. Making the world a better place through orgasmic meditation. And they did
[00:06:45] Ellen Huet: lots of things that mimicked what tech companies and tech founders did at the time. Nicole gave
[00:06:50] Ellen Huet: this TEDx talk that was viewed on YouTube for, you know, more than two million times. She spoke
[00:06:56] Ellen Huet: onstage at South by Southwest for an hour. She and her company even hosted these two conferences
[00:07:03] Ellen Huet: in 2013 and 2014 at the Regency Center in San Francisco, where, you know, a thousand people showed
[00:07:10] Ellen Huet: up for the whole weekend and wore those lanyards around their neck that, you know, instead of saying,
[00:07:15] Ellen Huet: like, WWDC or like Google I.O, they happened to say agent of orgasm because the conference was
[00:07:24] Ellen Huet: about orgasmic meditation. But if you didn't know what they were gathering for, it would honestly
[00:07:28] Ellen Huet: look like a developer's conference. And there was this sense that they were tapping into some of
[00:07:35] Ellen Huet: the ethos that was also really popular in San Francisco in the 2010s. And to be clear, they were
[00:07:40] Ellen Huet: also in New York, LA, Austin, Boulder, London, Australia. But in SF, you think about people who were
[00:07:47] Ellen Huet: moving to San Francisco, people were, you know, exploring polyamory people were doing biohacking.
[00:07:54] Ellen Huet: All of a sudden in this practice that is a 15 minute hack to a better life, it doesn't sound
[00:07:59] Ellen Huet: so out of place. And they even got endorsed by Tim Ferris, who of course is kind of like a hero to
[00:08:04] Ellen Huet: a lot of people in tech who are looking for like peak performance, whether that's, you know, mental
[00:08:09] Ellen Huet: or physical. And they used to set up booths at like the early morning sober dance parties that I,
[00:08:16] Ellen Huet: you know, maybe you guys don't go to, but I definitely know people who have gone to those. And,
[00:08:21] Ellen Huet: you know, they would hold own workshops at Burning Man occasionally, or they would set up booths
[00:08:26] at like the bulletproof coffee conferences. Like it was both interesting how what they were selling
[00:08:33] Ellen Huet: was quite fringe, and I'll acknowledge that. But it was also, they found footholds in what was
[00:08:38] Ellen Huet: kind of this growing mainstream, both wellness. The capitalism sort of ethos and aesthetic
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_04: reached everything. I think once your sex cult decides, oh, we should wrap ourselves in like the
[00:08:51] SPEAKER_04: world of startups and business. Yeah, it does say something in the culture about just the
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_04: ascendancy of. And don't forget like the wellness industry was booming at the time. Nicole spoke
[00:09:01] Ellen Huet: on stage at the group health conference in 2017. I was going to say this is very goop. Yeah.
[00:09:06] It's very goop. And of course, they managed to get that clinch that most important endorsement.
[00:09:12] Ellen Huet: Gwyneth is the queen of wellness alternative therapies. And at the same time in the 2010s,
[00:09:19] Ellen Huet: there was also this desire to see female founders at the top of fast growing startups. Like,
[00:09:26] Ellen Huet: I hate to use the term CEO, but remember, we used to use that term like very seriously.
[00:09:30] Ellen Huet: Girlboss, like there was just this energy that propelled the company, which was this mix of
[00:09:38] Ellen Huet: wellness startups, female empowerment, female leaders, you know, female leaders. And yeah,
[00:09:45] Ellen Huet: just this idea that we can improve our bodies through a practice like this.
[00:09:48] Ellen Huet: Right. And Ellen, what's interesting to me too is you and I both grew up in the Bay Area.
[00:09:52] Eric: You're like your peninsula kid, right? I'm from Fremont, so it's kind of like
[00:09:57] Ellen Huet: Southeast Bay. What is that? Southeast Bay? Okay. But yeah, I mean like somewhere in Batuda.
[00:10:02] Eric: Yeah, it's Bay Area, but I don't know which one you call it. It's an 880. You're an 80. Suburbs.
[00:10:06] Eric: Yeah. Yeah. It's like, you know, you see a lot about what makes this area interesting is that
[00:10:12] Eric: there does have this kind of leftover hippie mentality, very like one battle after another.
[00:10:16] Eric: These people who, you know, tried to change the world through cultural and maybe radical ideas
[00:10:21] Eric: that sort of settle into the sort of capitalist system that, you know, is very rewarding to people,
[00:10:27] Eric: but you still hold on to your beliefs. You're sort of somewhat leftist cultural beliefs. And
[00:10:33] Eric: they're always at conflict with each other and you have to sort of resolve the conflict in some way.
[00:10:37] Eric: And, you know, sometimes it just comes up that your Steve Jobs and you make one of the greatest,
[00:10:42] Eric: you know, most successful companies of all time. And then there's also the kind of scammy aspect of
[00:10:46] Eric: it in which like the two sides don't really meld on that well. And I think that's why something
[00:10:50] Eric: to a degree, why it let like, you know, one touch only really could have existed in one taste. I'm sorry.
[00:10:56] Eric: That one taste, more than one touch. One taste could have only existed in the Bay Area
[00:11:03] Eric: because it's just, it's something unique to the culture here and why it was also ultimately so
[00:11:08] Eric: destructive, I think, and so damaging. And this mix of, yeah, it's this mix of like
[00:11:12] Ellen Huet: spiritual pursuits plus like, yeah, this capitalistic energy that has, especially over the last
[00:11:19] Ellen Huet: couple decades, become, you know, an inherent part of San Francisco in the Bay Area. You know,
[00:11:25] Ellen Huet: it, it, it, it sounds kind of funny now because it's so ingrained in our thinking, but it was
[00:11:32] Ellen Huet: pretty radical 15 years ago to imagine using mindfulness and meditation to like,
[00:11:37] Ellen Huet: improve your output at work. But that is such a bizarre combination that came about in San
[00:11:44] Ellen Huet: Francisco. You know, it's like, what's interesting about one taste is it does bridge these like
[00:11:49] Ellen Huet: older and like, scent, this sense of kind of the spiritual new age seeker side of San Francisco,
[00:11:56] Ellen Huet: which has been around for decades. And then it, it happens to come about at this time when people
[00:12:01] Ellen Huet: looking at those influences and then also asking themselves, how can we use this
[00:12:06] to make more money? You can imagine like the wisdom 2.0 conference or like Google
[00:12:10] Ellen Huet: employee workshops on mindfulness in the workplace. Like, those are all examples of that
[00:12:15] Ellen Huet: melding. And I think that melding is also what helped one case be successful in this particular
[00:12:20] Ellen Huet: time and place. Totally. I did want to say also what I found, you know, when things, of course,
[00:12:24] Madeline: inevitably take a turn with cults and sex and power. The blending of those two aspects of
[00:12:31] Madeline: San Francisco culture were also apparent, right? Like, people were simultaneously getting, you
[00:12:37] Madeline: know, into these complicated sexual dynamics with power plays that were also corrupted by not
[00:12:43] Madeline: hitting their sales goals by selling the courses, right? So you would have simultaneously your cult
[00:12:49] Madeline: leader also be your boss that's chastising you for underperforming at work. And it's kind of to
[00:12:55] Madeline: blend that work, work a holic kind of capitalist ideal of bringing wellness to the masses
[00:13:02] Madeline: through mass-produced courses saw, you know, many archetypes of the common take down of a
[00:13:09] Madeline: business that was run by an abusive boss, just as much as it was a sex cult leader that was
[00:13:14] Madeline: manipulating people through really harmful religious groups. Yeah. I think more so than other
[00:13:22] Ellen Huet: hypothetical groups that people might imagine when they think of cults, you might have this
[00:13:25] Ellen Huet: kind of outdated idea that a cult is like a bearded man on a rural homestead with followers who
[00:13:32] Ellen Huet: all wear the same clothing in the two more. No more. It's the wildest wildest country.
[00:13:36] Ellen Huet: It's the same like the other groups. Yeah. People are thinking of that, but the truth is cults
[00:13:40] Ellen Huet: adapt with the times. This is one of the most interesting things that I learned while researching
[00:13:44] Ellen Huet: this book is that they are constantly changing to reflect what people value, what people look at,
[00:13:52] Ellen Huet: what feels current. And so, you know, when I talk to researchers who study cults, they were like,
[00:13:57] Ellen Huet: oh yeah, we expect that in the future more than in the past, cult leaders might be women or that
[00:14:03] Ellen Huet: they might have a presence that is very online or that they might reach new followers through
[00:14:09] Ellen Huet: Instagram or have YouTube seminars or and you can see examples of these already popping up. And
[00:14:14] Ellen Huet: I think, you know, what's fascinating is to realize that yeah, they are also going to, you know,
[00:14:19] Ellen Huet: they might end up looking more commercial. And what One Taste did was sure it was the spiritual
[00:14:24] Ellen Huet: pursuit, but it was also like a business where they were very much, as you said, pushing to reach
[00:14:29] Ellen Huet: sales goals all the time. And in fact, you would see how the philosophies that underlined like their
[00:14:36] ideas of orgasmic living would also then push them to do more sales or they would be interconnected
[00:14:42] Ellen Huet: in some way. Like, for example, many people told me that sales workers were often chastised if they
[00:14:48] Ellen Huet: weren't hitting their sales goals, but they would be told that it's not because they were asking
[00:14:52] Ellen Huet: the wrong questions or going after the wrong customers. It was because their orgasmic energy was
[00:14:56] Ellen Huet: blocked up. And so the solution that would help you make more sales was often that your manager or
[00:15:03] Ellen Huet: some leader above you in the group would say, you need to go have sex with someone or you need to
[00:15:07] Ellen Huet: go have sex with your coworker. If two coworkers were disputing, people told me that they were
[00:15:11] Ellen Huet: sometimes instructed to go home together or have sex with each other as a way of like unblocking
[00:15:16] Ellen Huet: this sexual energy. So there's this unique mix of their spiritual teachings with this. Yeah,
[00:15:21] Ellen Huet: this very nuts and bolts like we need to be bringing in revenue to keep the business afloat.
[00:15:26] SPEAKER_03: This podcast is sponsored by Google. Hey folks, I'm Amar,
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_03: Product and Design Lead at Google Deepind. We just launched a revamped vibe coding experience

[00:15:51] SPEAKER_03: Head to AI.Studio slash build to create your first app.
[00:15:55] Cored to the crime here was what employees having sex with Nicole's boyfriend who is basically
[00:16:05] SPEAKER_04: a tech guy who is like throwing money around and keeping this thing afloat. Is that a fair
[00:16:10] SPEAKER_04: fair gloss? Right. Wasn't he their major angel investor or basically their main investor?
[00:16:15] Madeline: Yeah. So in the early days of one taste, the company as many startups are was not profitable.
[00:16:22] Ellen Huet: Real line was some guy. It was losing money. They were paying expenses like rent and
[00:16:29] Ellen Huet: money that they needed to run the business and they weren't bringing in enough through courses.
[00:16:33] Ellen Huet: And one of the ways that they ended up supporting the business and keeping it afloat was that
[00:16:37] Ellen Huet: Nicole happened to meet in the mid-2000s. This man named Reese Jones who is a venture capitalist.
[00:16:44] Ellen Huet: He had sold a company to Motorola in the early 2000s for about $200 million.
[00:16:49] Ellen Huet: He later became involved with Singularity University. He was very interested in esoteric topics and
[00:16:56] Ellen Huet: the Singularity and science and things like that. He was also interested in one taste. He
[00:17:02] Ellen Huet: and Nicole started dating. What he did is he would pay for certain business expenses for the company.
[00:17:08] Ellen Huet: He would loan them money. His repayment instead of maybe shares in the company.
[00:17:15] Ellen Huet: And this is documented in court testimony as well as in my reporting. He was rewarded with
[00:17:20] Ellen Huet: sexual favors by one taste employees. And that often looks like
[00:17:26] Ellen Huet: these elaborate BDSM immersive sexual experiences for his birthday, which again, according to
[00:17:33] Ellen Huet: court testimony, were themed after things like the seven deadly sins or the Wizard of Oz.
[00:17:39] Ellen Huet: And he was also arranged to have a sexual handler, someone who was, you know, there was a
[00:17:46] Ellen Huet: rotation of people who took this role, but they would do something like live with him,
[00:17:51] Ellen Huet: take care of some household tasks, maybe take care of his dog, and then sexually service him every
[00:17:56] Ellen Huet: day. And this was, you know, so in some sense, again, it's like, yeah, a startup finds an early
[00:18:01] Ellen Huet: angel investor who believes in them and helps get them off the ground. But of course, the arrangement
[00:18:05] Ellen Huet: is very unusual and not something that I just, it's true, I must start up.
[00:18:10] Ellen Huet: Did it make good money at any point? Like, how did one taste the business?
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_04: They have said that at their peak, they brought in something like 12 million in revenue in one
[00:18:18] Ellen Huet: year. So again, in the grand scheme of companies that are often discussed on this podcast,
[00:18:23] Ellen Huet: right? Some potatoes. They had no outside investors. They was actually, you know, at some point,
[00:18:34] Ellen Huet: I believe Nicole was something like the only shareholder. So the, you know, in the end, when she sold
[00:18:43] Ellen Huet: her stake in the company in 2017, that was before I had done any reporting on them.
[00:18:48] Ellen Huet: She apparently walked away with, yeah, something like 12 million dollars.
[00:18:53] Ellen Huet: You have to wonder like what percentage of people who, you know, there's so many randos in
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_04: tech that have sold their business for like 200 million dollars. And to have that much money,
[00:19:04] SPEAKER_04: I, some huge prosogem have to be like trying to create like schemes like, you know, have little
[00:19:10] SPEAKER_04: worlds that like revolve around them of different degrees of like sexual depravity. But you always
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_04: want to know who knows who knows what the post economic get us to. Right. Yeah, exactly. This is,
[00:19:22] SPEAKER_04: was this guy just sloppy, you know, it's like other people were like, you know, had their lawyers
[00:19:27] SPEAKER_04: more involved or more buttoned up like, I know, I couldn't say. But yeah, truly, if you, if you have,
[00:19:33] Ellen Huet: you know, if you have enough money to be post economic, I think as we've seen with many people
[00:19:37] Ellen Huet: in Silicon Valley, you can then your free to explore lots of interesting things. Like I, you know,
[00:19:42] Ellen Huet: there are people who then, you know, go off and do a bunch of meditation or they get really into
[00:19:47] Ellen Huet: like designer watches or they start another company or, you know, it's like that's the freedom
[00:19:52] Ellen Huet: that that kind of money can get you as you can pursue your interests. Right. I mean, there is sort of
[00:19:57] Eric: this like, I wouldn't call them middle class, but that kind of like an archipelago of, of Deca
[00:20:02] Eric: millionaires and maybe some centimillionaires in the Bay Area that you don't think that much about.
[00:20:06] Eric: But that's, you know, a huge amount of money to fund your pursuits, whatever they may need.
[00:20:11] Eric: Fund your burning man can't fund a very, very expensive art car that you can trot around the
[00:20:16] Ellen Huet: playa. Look, I'm sure that there's someone who's done that. A good percentage of people do just
[00:20:20] Eric: fund it towards that, right. They funnel their money towards extremely elaborate burning man
[00:20:24] Eric: experiences. And that's, you know, relatively, uh, does it non-destructive? It's hard to say.
[00:20:30] Eric: That's probably its own book. They probably just start angel investing. Yeah. Yeah. We can do both.
[00:20:37] Eric: Really. I mean, ideally, um, I can't believe I'm the one asking this question here, but it's just
[00:20:42] Eric: something that kind of came to me as as we were, you know, discussing this topic. But, you know, like
[00:20:48] Eric: the mystification of the female orgasm, I feel like is this thing that, you know, has been going
[00:20:56] Eric: on for some time. I mean, you know, this idea of like, oh, it's this mysterious thing that,
[00:21:00] Eric: you know, contains spiritual properties to it. And, you know, it's more than just a biological act.
[00:21:05] Eric: There's some sort of like mystical, you know, a thing going on here. Obviously, that's a big part
[00:21:11] Eric: of female empowerment, I feel like, and, and, you know, the way that, and, and, like, look in your book,
[00:21:15] Eric: you also talk about pickup culture being sort of woven into this culture too. So it's like in one
[00:21:21] Eric: sense, there's like high-minded feminine ideals, but also like the most misogynistic impulses of
[00:21:26] Eric: men. I'm like, how to break women down. And the people coming into this community have been
[00:21:31] Madeline: familiar with the pickup artist world, right? Wasn't that part of your book? I mean, there were,
[00:21:36] Ellen Huet: yeah, essentially just to kind of situate one taste in time. It's like, there were some
[00:21:41] Ellen Huet: men who maybe started off in the pickup artist community and then actually drifted toward one
[00:21:47] Ellen Huet: taste because they thought they didn't like the sort of misogynistic attitude of the pickup artist
[00:21:52] Ellen Huet: world and wanted to have something that was a little bit more spiritually inclined. And, but
[00:21:57] Ellen Huet: certainly that wasn't like a majority thing, but it's just if people remember what the energy
[00:22:03] Ellen Huet: of the world was like in 2005 when Neil Strauss's The Game was like at the top of the New York
[00:22:07] Ellen Huet: Times bestseller list, it's kind of like a marker in time. But Tom, to your question or at
[00:22:13] Ellen Huet: least what I think you were getting at, I think that a major selling point, a major selling point
[00:22:20] Ellen Huet: of orgasmic meditation of these courses that one taste was offering is that sexuality is for a
[00:22:26] Ellen Huet: lot of people this puzzle that maybe they've had a traumatic or complicated past or maybe they're
[00:22:33] Ellen Huet: one of the estimated 10 to 15% of American women who struggle to have an orgasm or maybe there's
[00:22:38] Ellen Huet: someone who struggles with performance anxiety during sex or maybe you have a fulfilling
[00:22:43] Ellen Huet: partnership, but the physical spark isn't quite there or something has changed. Like, I have a
[00:22:47] Ellen Huet: lot of compassion for people who were looking for answers as to these deep and really personal
[00:22:54] Ellen Huet: questions. In part because there are very few places where you can go to talk about them.
[00:23:00] Ellen Huet: In one case was one of the few places I was really putting up the banner and saying
[00:23:04] Ellen Huet: we will have straightforward, like really direct conversations about your sex life and we have
[00:23:10] Ellen Huet: a promise that doing this practice as confronting as you might consider it is going to help.
[00:23:15] Ellen Huet: And so for people who are looking for answers and not finding that many places that are offering
[00:23:20] Ellen Huet: them, I think it made them more likely to want to see what one has had to offer and maybe even if
[00:23:27] Ellen Huet: they had some misgivings to continue with the courses because it's such a deep and primal human
[00:23:34] Ellen Huet: need to feel connected to other people in that way. Which is what makes the exploitation even more
[00:23:39] Eric: gross, right? Is that these are people who are seeking orgasmic meditation. The practice has a
[00:23:45] Ellen Huet: lot that is commendable about it. And I hope that readers of Empire of orgasm come away with a
[00:23:50] Ellen Huet: nuanced understanding of what was being offered here. It was a radically female focused,
[00:23:55] Ellen Huet: pleasure practice. We don't have a lot of those. There was this commendable desire to
[00:24:00] kind of correct what they saw as an unfair focus on male pleasure in sex or an unfair conditioning
[00:24:08] Ellen Huet: of women to feel like part of their job is to provide sexual pleasure to men rather than to like
[00:24:14] Ellen Huet: receive it. And so there's a lot that I think was genuinely valuable about the practice and that
[00:24:21] Ellen Huet: even those who feel that they were mistreated or harmed by one taste, they've also expressed to me
[00:24:26] Ellen Huet: that they mourn the fact that this practice never really got the chance to shine on its own separate
[00:24:32] Ellen Huet: from the outside. Yeah, so for the startup entrepreneur listening to this podcast, you think,
[00:24:37] SPEAKER_04: one taste is just too soon. It's like Andreessen Horowitz needs to back the next version. You think
[00:24:43] SPEAKER_04: there are a void of a couple of pitfalls? I mean, look, I think sexuality, it's a tough
[00:24:52] Ellen Huet: business and you'll probably struggle to get banked by and deal with payments and stuff.
[00:24:59] Ellen Huet: That being said, over the course of my time as a reporter, I have occasionally talked to people
[00:25:05] Ellen Huet: who run companies and startups that are trying to help people improve their sex lives or have
[00:25:12] Ellen Huet: like they're really well-intentioned and it is a tough business but these people are often
[00:25:16] Ellen Huet: quite motivated by the idea that it is, I think if you can crack it, a huge market. And I think it's
[00:25:23] Ellen Huet: it's- Do you remember when we went to South by Southwest together? I think you and I as reporters
[00:25:28] SPEAKER_04: went to some party where it was like an app that was clearly like I think a sex worker app,
[00:25:32] SPEAKER_04: or they're always these, do you remember that? Do you know what I'm talking about? I vaguely
[00:25:35] SPEAKER_04: remember that. I mean, it's like- You know- You're at some party where it's like when you do this,
[00:25:41] Ellen Huet: yeah. When I was in college, we had a founder, I think this was you know about you know,
[00:25:48] Madeline: seven years ago, but we had a founder who had gone to Barnard and had founded like this really
[00:25:55] Madeline: feminine focused like sex toy company and had raised some good venture capital funding and was
[00:26:01] Madeline: like packaging this, you know, it was super package goods as a company, it was DTC, but it was
[00:26:07] Madeline: you know, is part of this sexuality wellness push and her, you know, talking about it, did come from
[00:26:13] Madeline: a very, you know, understandable and somewhat in noble place because you know this is a gap and
[00:26:19] Madeline: this is a need that needs to be filled and there is a market for it in a healthy way. And so- More
[00:26:23] Madeline: morally redeemed than gambling or whatever is in the prediction- In the app, right.
[00:26:30] SPEAKER_04: What's your view on capitalism now? You know, you work for Bloomberg, we all write about money,
[00:26:34] SPEAKER_04: like this sort of peak capitalism ethos, like I don't know, where do you think this headed? Is it like
[00:26:44] SPEAKER_04: just like whatever, you know, this real need to sort of demystify, I don't know, the
[00:26:50] SPEAKER_04: few more- Or orgasism or help people with sexuality, like is that a market? Will the market ever
[00:26:55] SPEAKER_04: solve that or do you think it needs to exist outside of a company or any observations about
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_04: the role for companies and these deep human problems? Yeah, I think it's an interesting question because if
[00:27:05] Ellen Huet: you spend time in the- Oh god, I mean kind of the like sexual, spiritual communities and there
[00:27:12] Ellen Huet: are a lot of places that will offer workshops about sexuality, people do sometimes debate the idea
[00:27:19] Ellen Huet: that like, can you sell this in a way that is never going to corrupt the offering? And I don't know,
[00:27:28] Ellen Huet: I mean, I believe that capitalism is pretty effective, like I- you know, I- it's hard for me to see
[00:27:34] Ellen Huet: that- that is inherently going to do some project. I think you can probably have a business that
[00:27:43] Ellen Huet: is offering something really helpful and is charging mine for it and like that seems to make sense
[00:27:47] Ellen Huet: to me, what I think happened at one taste is that, you know, the personalities and the forces
[00:27:55] Ellen Huet: that were running this company were, you know, Nicole is an interesting and fascinating character
[00:28:02] Ellen Huet: and my read of her to some extent is that she experienced- what she believes as personal growth
[00:28:10] Ellen Huet: through extreme experiences, sexual and otherwise, like she also has talked about taking lots of
[00:28:17] Ellen Huet: drugs, taking lots of LSD in her past and she believed that this form of pursuing personal growth
[00:28:24] Ellen Huet: worked for her and should work for other people and so the culture within one taste was infused
[00:28:30] Ellen Huet: with this sense that extreme experiences and intensity were going to bring you personal growth
[00:28:37] Ellen Huet: and for some people that was true and it was helpful and for some people I think it led to
[00:28:44] Ellen Huet: really harmful places and I think that that's more at the heart of it than the fact that they were
[00:28:51] Ellen Huet: charging money for it. I mean, to be- to be clear, if you spend enough time- it's- it's sort of all
[00:28:56] Ellen Huet: under the startup story more in that like, oh great startups often attract these leaders who are like
[00:29:02] SPEAKER_04: see themselves as Messiah-like figures and sometimes that leads these companies to great success and
[00:29:08] SPEAKER_04: they also are like often anti-social personalities that treat people poorly and then you add
[00:29:13] SPEAKER_04: layer-in, she has access to all this sex to throw it around and control people with. It goes off the
[00:29:19] SPEAKER_04: rails even more than just an Adam Newman who's telling you to live your life. And keep in mind like,
[00:29:25] Ellen Huet: if you're gonna look at other startups and say like, oh, the fact that this company grew so big and
[00:29:30] Ellen Huet: had such a huge valuation that was, you know, if you try to say that that's what led to problems,
[00:29:35] Ellen Huet: well it's like, yeah, one taste was never valued that highly and it's still, you know, so I think
[00:29:40] Ellen Huet: money certainly played a role in some of the pressures that people felt within one taste because
[00:29:45] Ellen Huet: there were times that they felt like, yeah, we really need to bring in a lot of revenue in order to
[00:29:49] Ellen Huet: keep the business going and that led to this pressure cooker type environment. But I think the
[00:29:54] Ellen Huet: truth is the problems that people have described to me at this company have roots that go much deeper
[00:30:01] Ellen Huet: than simply the commercial aspect of it. Right. And you think about like, you know, the term that we
[00:30:06] Eric: use very literally is the cult of the founder. Like there is this sort of embrace within Silicon
[00:30:12] Eric: Valley on like, these people have, they are imbued with unique properties that you just want to be
[00:30:17] Eric: around and they will bring you towards enlightenment and fulfillment, whether it's capitalistic or
[00:30:22] Eric: sexual or otherwise. It's like, there's something unique about these people that you just want to be
[00:30:26] Eric: around them. And even if the business funnel doesn't make sense if there are things about what
[00:30:30] Eric: they're doing that like cross a huge number of your personal ethical boundaries, doesn't matter
[00:30:35] Eric: because they figured it out. They know something greater and like, that's enough for people to invest
[00:30:40] Eric: in companies for VCs. I mean, cult dynamics exists on a spectrum. cults exist on a spectrum. One
[00:30:46] Ellen Huet: takeaway I hope people take from the book is that it's a little, you kind of lose sight of the
[00:30:53] Ellen Huet: of the goal when you debate like, is it a cult or not? It's more like, okay, what are some dynamics
[00:30:58] Ellen Huet: that exist commonly in cults and are they present here or are they not present? And one of the things
[00:31:02] Ellen Huet: that cults do really well and this can sometimes be a positive thing or a negative thing is that
[00:31:09] Ellen Huet: they're very good at behavior change. So if you get in meshed in one, like your life will change.
[00:31:15] Ellen Huet: And so I think for a lot of these companies that have maybe like a reputation of having sort of
[00:31:20] Ellen Huet: like, oh, we're going to use the word cult to describe them in a lighthearted way. They might be
[00:31:25] Ellen Huet: gesturing at that. They might be gesturing at the fact that when you are part of this group, you feel
[00:31:31] Ellen Huet: you have a new mission and there's a purpose and maybe like, it becomes a bigger part of your
[00:31:35] Ellen Huet: personality than just a normal employer or a normal workplace. And I'm not necessarily saying that
[00:31:40] Ellen Huet: that's inherently a bad thing. Like, I think if you really want to change your life, like some of
[00:31:45] Ellen Huet: these groups can offer. It's true in relationships. It's everything. You are who you spend time with
[00:31:49] SPEAKER_04: and it's all sort of a spectrum of how sort of coercive those things are. Metalying of a last
[00:31:56] SPEAKER_04: worry last question. Yeah, well, I was just going to say I mean, is sole cycle a cult? Like,
[00:32:00] Madeline: that's a group that results in a lot of behavior change and chanting in some ways in a dark room
[00:32:06] Madeline: with a leader. So. Well, one of the, I mean, one of the sort of obvious but interesting things
[00:32:12] Ellen Huet: about what makes people vulnerable to high demand groups or cults is that if they are feeling
[00:32:18] Ellen Huet: isolated or lonely or purposeless in their life and then something comes along to offer it,
[00:32:23] then they might be more likely to be drawn in. And yeah, it's like if people aren't having regular
[00:32:30] access to moments of awe and wonder and transcendence and community, could something like sole
[00:32:37] Ellen Huet: cycle help fill that gap? Sure. Could something like one taste fill that gap? Sure. Like,
[00:32:43] Ellen Huet: it speaks to, I think, sole cycle is like somewhere on the spectrum and one taste might be on a
[00:32:49] Ellen Huet: different spot on the spectrum, but their existence and their appeal speaks to this
[00:32:54] very universal human need that we need to fill that sense of awe and wonder.
[00:32:58] Ellen Huet: I do think we have a core problem just like people like going to church, not as much as they
[00:33:04] SPEAKER_04: used to. God, God is dead. For many people don't believe in God anymore. I don't believe in God.
[00:33:09] SPEAKER_04: If you don't believe in God, what are you supposed to do if you're silly to like go to church?
[00:33:14] SPEAKER_04: They search for all these other things. A lot of them pretty hollow. They only speak to,
[00:33:19] SPEAKER_04: some of humanity. So yeah, I feel like we haven't as a society invented a church replacement
[00:33:26] SPEAKER_04: that sort of covers the same ground. I spoke to someone who is like a former cult member and who
[00:33:32] Ellen Huet: is like a consultant that tries to help people leave high demand groups. And I asked her like,
[00:33:40] Ellen Huet: if you could prescribe something broadly for society that would help lower the risk of people
[00:33:43] Ellen Huet: joining these damaging groups, what would you do? And she said, I really wish I could just
[00:33:47] Ellen Huet: bring back healthy religion. Like she was like, if more people were religious, we would have
[00:33:52] Ellen Huet: lots of this risk. And so obviously that comes with complicated, you know, that's easier set
[00:33:58] Ellen Huet: than done. But I think it's speaking to something true about our digital age, our COVID era lives,
[00:34:05] Ellen Huet: like our increasingly secular lives. It creates this breeding ground where people are looking for
[00:34:11] Ellen Huet: meaning and sometimes finding it in the wrong place.
[00:34:15] A good yeah, there's a unicorn company to come out of this. Somebody.
[00:34:20] SPEAKER_04: I think it's ended with the era, I guess. That feels like a good place is any to end it.
[00:34:26] Eric: So I really want to have like a Larry King live, like the book is called Empire of orgasm.
[00:34:32] Eric: Yes. I'll do it. Please, Empire of orgasm. It's out now. Yes. Find it wherever you find your
[00:34:37] Ellen Huet: books, Amazon bookshop, your local bookstore. Thanks for coming on. Thanks for having me on.
