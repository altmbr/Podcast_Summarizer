# Podcast Summary: David Ulevitch on American Dynamism

## 1. Key Themes

### **Private Capital as Superior Alternative to Government R&D Funding**
The fundamental insight is that private capital can deliver better outcomes than direct government R&D funding by eliminating bureaucratic overhead while maintaining accountability. David explains: "If you don't pay for the R&D, you just buy the finished product. All you have to do is commit to buying the finished product. We'll fund the R&D and you can get rid of all the auditing and accounting and constant oversight that you provide. Because that's our job, this private capital. We'll make sure that we're good stewards of our capital and our investors capital." [[00:17:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=17m16s) The government's $50 million R&D grant comes with so much auditing and oversight burden that it's "almost impossible for these small companies to cope with that level of oversight," which is why contracts typically go to defense primes who simply charge more to cover these costs. [[00:16:53]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=16m43s)

### **Defense Procurement Reform as Critical Bottleneck**
The current defense procurement system structurally favors incumbents and prevents innovation. David identifies two major problems: "It's very common in defense procurement to say, what have you delivered in the past is an important criteria for deciding if you get awarded a contract for the future. But a lot of startups have been delivered to anything in the past." [[00:18:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=18m3s) Additionally, Congress appropriates money for specific products from specific vendors rather than solutions to problems, which prevents adaptation to rapidly changing battlefield conditions. He cites Ukraine drone warfare evolution: "If you look at the government's appropriations from five years ago, there was nothing about a very little about like a tritable drones in electronic warfare to deal with the massive influx of drones that are being sent at soldiers. But that's what the people on the battlefield need today." [[00:19:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=19m15s)

### **Supply Chain Dependency as Existential Threat**
American dependence on China for critical materials and components represents a fundamental vulnerability that transcends pure defense concerns. David warns: "A lot of the raw materials we need for our own shipbuilding comes from China, the steel, and then the metals. A lot of the things we need for batteries, for motors, for a lot of the ingredients we need to actually make that drones we want to make, and get how to use vehicles we want to make. They all come from China. And so it's not just about defense procurement." [[00:20:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=20m34s) This creates cascading vulnerabilities: "If you actually don't have these foundational components that are rock solid here in this country, everything else falls apart. Like all the B2Bs, SAs falls apart, all the ad click optimization to a fall apart." [[00:23:27]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=23m17s)

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### **Venture Capital Must Prioritize National Infrastructure Over Consumer Apps**
David argues that foundational national security and infrastructure investments are prerequisites for all other tech innovation, not just parallel priorities. "If you don't have a strong democracy, if you don't have a strong economy in a strong country, like all the stuff on top falls apart. You need to have public safety, you need to have defense, you need to have energy, reliability. And so I think all these things are actually critical even for all the stuff that just sits on top that we all benefit from." [[00:23:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=23m26s) This directly contradicts the conventional VC wisdom of focusing on high-margin software with network effects.

### **American Dynamism as Meme-to-Movement Strategy**
The American Dynamism practice launched without dedicated capital, essentially as marketing before substance. Catherine Boyle characterized it as "a meme that was becoming a movement. And we announced that we had committed all this money to it. But we actually had no fun. We were just like borrowing venture dollars for it." [[00:06:22]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=6m12s) This contrarian approach—announcing a major initiative without securing the capital first—worked because timing aligned with geopolitical events making the thesis obvious in retrospect.

### **Government Should Stop Trying to Pick Winners**
Rather than the government directly funding innovation, David advocates for government only committing to purchase outcomes: "We don't need them to fund R&D. We need them to commit to buying outcomes and buying solutions." [[00:18:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=17m53s) This inverts the conventional defense innovation model where government programs like SBIR/STTR fund early-stage R&D. His argument is that VCs are "better pickers of who's going to deliver great technology than the government is. And that's because we've been doing it a lot longer." [[00:17:46]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=17m36s)

### **The Silicon Valley Defense Exodus Was Temporary Aberration**
David frames the Google Project Maven walkout as an anomaly rather than inevitability: "In 2018, Google had bailed out of Project Maven and there was a big protest attack Google and people decided they weren't participating. We believe in the romance of technology of industry... We believe that we have been and will always be the masters of technology, not mastered by technology." [[00:00:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=15s) This perspective positions defense work as core to Silicon Valley's DNA, with the 2010s tech company resistance as the outlier period.

## 3. Companies Identified

**Anduril**
- **Description**: Defense technology company building autonomous systems and surveillance towers
- **Why Mentioned**: Series B investment that gave David credibility to build the American Dynamism practice; exemplifies using commodity hardware with advanced software for defense applications
- **Quotes**: "Andrew, even then, was very unapologetic that they were a defense company. And they were trying to build the next great defense prime." [[00:03:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=3m33s) "Their first century tower was essentially off the shelf parts that they put together with their advanced software. They built a coordination layer called lattice." [[00:08:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=8m0s) "Real-headed announcement yesterday, it's like called EGLY, which is their new body-worn headset... it's definitely very advanced AI software in a way that the warfighter has never been able to utilize in the past." [[00:25:29]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=25m19s)

**Flock Safety**
- **Description**: Public safety company using AI-powered cameras for vehicle identification and crime prevention

- **Quotes**: "Garrett, the CEO of Flux Safety, called her the night before she was supposed to have Flux pitch to the general catalyst team. And it was like, oh, the deal got done. I'm going with Yule of it." [[00:04:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=4m40s) "Flux safety uses AI to be able to do like free form search. You can say instead of saying, you know, you might know that a car pulled up in a Rob DeGaustation... oh, that's like a silver camera with aftermarket rims and a spoiler. Well, that AI can take that text and then go through it to a full image search and find the right silver camera." [[00:27:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=26m57s)

**Airspace Intelligence**
- **Description**: AI-powered flight operations and planning platform for airlines
- **Why Mentioned**: Example of AI transforming logistics and infrastructure
- **Quotes**: "Airspace Intelligence does flight operations and planning using AI. So you can have the most efficient flight planning save the most amount of fuel, make sure that the least amount of flights get canceled. And right now a lot of that kind of work for airlines happens in spreadsheets, but Airspace Intelligence uses the AI to do it all programmatically and automatically." [[00:26:39]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=26m29s)

**SpaceX**
- **Description**: Private aerospace manufacturer and space transportation company
- **Why Mentioned**: Proof that American Dynamism companies can achieve massive scale while remaining private, addressing LP liquidity concerns
- **Quotes**: "When you look at a company like SpaceX that's still private, I think now investors recognize, and they just had an incredible launch yesterday. Like I think now investors recognize this is one of the transformative companies in this country at a dollar invested in SpaceX as a dollar put to a good place." [[00:22:51]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=22m41s)

## 4. People Identified

**Palmer Luckey**
- **Description**: Founder of Oculus and Anduril
- **Why Mentioned**: Exemplifies the founder talent driving American Dynamism despite being treated as "pariah" for political reasons
- **Quotes**: "Palmer Lucky, a few years earlier, had left Meta, had been accused of being some major right-wing financier. It turned out it was $9,000 for one billboard once. And none of it was true. But it was a big scandal. And he was treated like a pariah and not as this genius founder of Oculus." [[00:03:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=2m53s)

**Catherine Boyle**
- **Description**: Co-leader of American Dynamism practice at Andreessen Horowitz
- **Why Mentioned**: Key partner who joined from General Catalyst to co-build the American Dynamism practice
- **Quotes**: "I met Catherine Boyle, who was at a rival firm, a general catalyst. And she thought she was going to do the Series B [of Anduril]. And so the way we met was we ended up having to split the Series B." [[00:03:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=3m47s) "I reached out to Catherine and said, hey, I think we should join forces rather than the competitors. Let's make this a full-throwed effort." [[00:05:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=5m40s)

- **Why Mentioned**: Long-standing supporters of government technology going back to Netscape's pioneering of SSL encryption
- **Quotes**: "Mark and Ben have always been super supportive of supporting the government and the national interests. People don't know this, but back in Netscape, they helped pioneer SSL, like the little encryption icon in your web browser to do secure encrypted communications." [[00:05:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=5m7s) "Mark was just like, everything that I said that I promised Catherine. Like, Mark was like, yes, and more."

- **Quotes**: "Garrett was like, hey, maybe you should talk to Yule of it. Or maybe the two of you should join forces. So actually Garrett Langley at Flux Safety sort of reconnected Catherine and I." [[00:05:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=4m58s)

## 5. Operating Insights

### **Use First Investment Success to Build Category Authority**
David leveraged Anduril's success to gain "leash to go make other investments" in the category. "Because Andro was a good investment, as you know, an adventure, if you make a good first investment in a category that can kind of give you the leash to go make other investments." [[00:04:29]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=4m19s) This demonstrates the importance of the anchor investment in establishing credibility for an entire thesis area.

### **Build Specialized Infrastructure Teams, Not Just Capital**
Andreessen Horowitz built a dedicated policy team in DC specifically for American Dynamism portfolio companies. "We've built out a policy team in DC. And there's work that we're really trying to advance that will benefit not just our companies, but all companies that are trying to build for the national interest." [[00:15:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=15m14s) This value-add differentiation addresses structural challenges that founders cannot solve alone, living up to the firm's philosophy of "build the firm that we wish we had when we were entrepreneurs." [[00:11:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=11m33s)

### **Convert Competitors into Collaborators Through Category Creation**
Rather than competing with Catherine Boyle across multiple deals, David proposed joining forces: "At the end of 2021, I reached out to Catherine and said, hey, I think we should join forces rather than the competitors. Let's make this a full-throwed effort." [[00:05:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=5m40s) This transformed a zero-sum competitive dynamic into category expansion where both could benefit.

### **Launch Category Before Securing Dedicated Capital**
The American Dynamism practice launched publicly before raising a dedicated fund, borrowing from existing venture pools. This created momentum and market awareness before formal capitalization, with the fund ($660M) following shortly after when the thesis proved timely. [[00:06:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=6m10s)

## 6. Overlooked Insights

### **Netscape's SSL as Foundational Government Technology Partnership**
David briefly mentions that Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz "helped pioneer SSL, like the little encryption icon in your web browser to do secure encrypted communications" back at Netscape. [[00:05:31]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=5m21s) This is hugely significant because it establishes that Andreessen Horowitz's government technology thesis isn't opportunistic—it's a 30-year continuation of their founding work. SSL encryption was critical for government secure communications, meaning the firm's defense technology work predates even the firm itself, going back to their operational experience in the 1990s. This historical continuity explains why they had conviction to back Anduril when other firms wouldn't touch defense.

### **JP Morgan's $1.5 Trillion Deliberately Avoided "American Dynamism" Branding**
David notes almost in passing: "I think they went out of their way, not to use words, dynamism. People sometimes don't want to call it American dynamism, even though it's obviously American dynamism." [[00:19:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy8c30fdBQ8&t=19m7s) This reveals significant tension in the market adoption of the category. Despite JP Morgan committing $1.5 trillion to what is clearly American Dynamism investing, they deliberately avoided the terminology—likely for political or branding reasons. This suggests the category has achieved substance but the branding remains contested, which could indicate either political sensitivities around explicitly "American" positioning or incumbent financial institutions' reluctance to adopt venture-originated framing. The substance has won even as players distance themselves from the label.
