[00:00:00] The pitch for Mark and Ben was if I came,
[00:00:01] David Ulevitch: traitors and hollets, I could do whatever I wanted.
[00:00:03] David Ulevitch: Year after I joined, Mark asked me if I wanted to meet Palmer
[00:00:06] David Ulevitch: and Andrew, even then, was very unapologetic
[00:00:09] David Ulevitch: that they were a defense company
[00:00:10] David Ulevitch: and they were trying to build the next great defense prime.
[00:00:12] David Ulevitch: Mark and Ben have always been super supportive
[00:00:15] David Ulevitch: of supporting the government and the national interests.
[00:00:17] David Ulevitch: People don't know this, but back in Netscape,
[00:00:18] David Ulevitch: they helped pioneer SSL, like the little encryption icon
[00:00:21] David Ulevitch: in your web browser to do secure encrypted communications.
[00:00:25] David Ulevitch: In 2018, Google had bailed out of Project Maven
[00:00:27] David Ulevitch: and there was a big protest attack Google
[00:00:29] David Ulevitch: and people decided they weren't participating.
[00:00:30] David Ulevitch: We believe in the romance of technology
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_00: of industry, the romance.
[00:00:33] SPEAKER_00: The eros of the train, the car, the electric light,
[00:00:37] SPEAKER_00: the skyscraper, the microchip, the neural network,
[00:00:39] SPEAKER_00: the rocket, the split atom.
[00:00:40] SPEAKER_00: We believe in adventure.
[00:00:42] SPEAKER_00: Undertaken the hero's journey, rebelling against the status quo,
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_00: mapping uncharted territory, conquering dragons
[00:00:47] SPEAKER_00: and bringing home the spoils for our community.
[00:00:50] SPEAKER_00: We believe that we have been and will always be
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_00: the masters of technology, not mastered by technology.
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_00: This is a really key point today.
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_00: The beginning of 2022, we launched the American Dynamism
[00:00:58] David Ulevitch: practice.
[00:00:59] David Ulevitch: It was like a meme that was becoming a movement.
[00:01:01] David Ulevitch: We were just borrowing venture dollars for it.
[00:01:03] David Ulevitch: Very shortly after that, we raised the first American
[00:01:05] David Ulevitch: dynamism fund.
[00:01:06] David Ulevitch: Private capital is now flowing in massively.
[00:01:10] Molly O'Shea: JP Morgan is going to commit $1.5 trillion
[00:01:13] Molly O'Shea: towards the category.
[00:01:14] Molly O'Shea: The one and a half trillion is a huge amount of money.
[00:01:17] David Ulevitch: And I think they went out of their way,
[00:01:18] David Ulevitch: not to use words, dining is a very,
[00:01:20] David Ulevitch: even though it's obviously American dynamism.
[00:01:21] David Ulevitch: And I think what you see with the JP Morgan announcement
[00:01:24] David Ulevitch: is just now broad skill recognition
[00:01:26] David Ulevitch: that we need to be investing in these areas.
[00:01:28] David Ulevitch: And I think there's going to be incredible returns
[00:01:29] David Ulevitch: for the investors.
[00:01:40] David Yulovich, welcome to Sorcery.
[00:01:43] Molly O'Shea: Thanks, Molly.
[00:01:44] Long time coming.
[00:01:46] David Ulevitch: Yeah, I think we've known each other a long time.
[00:01:48] David Ulevitch: But I generally don't do podcasts.
[00:01:50] Well, thank you for joining this one.
[00:01:52] David Ulevitch: We've got a lot to talk about.
[00:01:53] Molly O'Shea: OK.
[00:01:54] David Ulevitch: We have American dynamism.
[00:01:55] Molly O'Shea: We have this new JP Morgan deal.
[00:01:57] Molly O'Shea: I want to go deeper into Andral.
[00:01:59] Molly O'Shea: And then we can also talk about your founding of OpenDNS.
[00:02:03] Molly O'Shea: Sure.
[00:02:04] David Ulevitch: OK.
[00:02:04] David Ulevitch: Lots to cover.
[00:02:05] David Ulevitch: A lot to cover.
[00:02:06] Molly O'Shea: So to start, let's break down the American dynamism fund
[00:02:10] Molly O'Shea: when this started, how you got Mark involved,
[00:02:14] Molly O'Shea: how you got even the buy-in to start this.
[00:02:16] Molly O'Shea: Sure.
[00:02:18] David Ulevitch: There's a bunch of different answers.
[00:02:19] David Ulevitch: And they're all true.
[00:02:20] David Ulevitch: It's how the American dynamism practiced and now fun started.
[00:02:25] David Ulevitch: The original, I would say I joined the firm in 2018 and 2019.
[00:02:30] David Ulevitch: You have to remember that era of 2018.
[00:02:32] David Ulevitch: This is when, in 2018, Google had
[00:02:34] David Ulevitch: Bill out of Project Maven, which was a government
[00:02:38] David Ulevitch: partnership to support advanced computing and advanced software
[00:02:41] David Ulevitch: like AI in the Department of Defense.
[00:02:44] David Ulevitch: And there was a big protestant type of Google.
[00:02:46] David Ulevitch: And people decided they didn't want to participate
[00:02:47] David Ulevitch: in Google, Bill out of it.
[00:02:49] David Ulevitch: And this is after Silicon Valley.
[00:02:50] David Ulevitch: It had basically its original founding story
[00:02:53] David Ulevitch: in origin of helping the government with the best technology.
[00:02:56] David Ulevitch: And now you had a company like Google
[00:02:57] David Ulevitch: basically bailing out of supporting the government.
[00:03:01] David Ulevitch: Palmer Lucky, a few years earlier,
[00:03:03] David Ulevitch: had left Meta, had been accused of being
[00:03:07] David Ulevitch: some major right-wing financier.
[00:03:08] David Ulevitch: It turned out it was $9,000 for one billboard once.
[00:03:12] David Ulevitch: And none of it was true.
[00:03:13] David Ulevitch: But it was a big scandal.
[00:03:14] David Ulevitch: And he was treated like a pariah and not
[00:03:17] David Ulevitch: as this genius founder of Oculus.
[00:03:19] David Ulevitch: So that was the start of 2018.
[00:03:21] David Ulevitch: I joined Andrews and Horowitz.
[00:03:23] David Ulevitch: The pitch for Mark and Ben was, if I
[00:03:25] David Ulevitch: came to Andrews and Horowitz, I could do whatever I wanted.
[00:03:27] David Ulevitch: That was a very good pitch.
[00:03:29] David Ulevitch: And a year after I joined, Mark asked me if I
[00:03:31] David Ulevitch: wanted to meet Palmer and Brian and the team at Andro.
[00:03:35] David Ulevitch: And I won't speak for Mark.
[00:03:37] David Ulevitch: But I think he was skeptical that the firm would get excited
[00:03:40] David Ulevitch: about a defense deal.
[00:03:42] David Ulevitch: And Andrew, even then, was very unapologetic
[00:03:44] David Ulevitch: that they were a defense company.
[00:03:45] David Ulevitch: And they were trying to build the next great defense prime.
[00:03:48] David Ulevitch: So I went down to Andro's offices.
[00:03:51] David Ulevitch: I'd already decided I wanted to do the deal.
[00:03:54] And this was their Series B. And when I went down there,
[00:03:57] David Ulevitch: I met Catherine Boyle, who was at a rival firm,
[00:03:59] David Ulevitch: a general catalyst.
[00:04:02] David Ulevitch: And she thought she was going to do the Series B.
[00:04:04] David Ulevitch: And so the way we met was we ended up having to split
[00:04:06] David Ulevitch: the Series B, which Andro sort of like brookered.
[00:04:10] David Ulevitch: They're like, OK, well, you both just do half.
[00:04:13] David Ulevitch: I think she was very unhappy with that outcome.
[00:04:15] David Ulevitch: So our first meeting was not.
[00:04:16] David Ulevitch: We didn't get off on the best foot.
[00:04:18] David Ulevitch: She has a funny version of that story.
[00:04:21] I won't tell it.
[00:04:22] David Ulevitch: I'll save it for another time.
[00:04:23] David Ulevitch: You can interview her.
[00:04:24] David Ulevitch: OK.
[00:04:26] And anyway, but that was the beginning.
[00:04:27] David Ulevitch: And because Andro was a good investment,
[00:04:29] David Ulevitch: as you know, an adventure, if you make a good first investment
[00:04:32] David Ulevitch: in a category that can kind of give you
[00:04:34] David Ulevitch: the leash to go make other investments.
[00:04:36] David Ulevitch: And so then fast forward to 2021.
[00:04:40] David Ulevitch: And I invested in a company called Flux Safety.
[00:04:43] David Ulevitch: And this is another one where I know Catherine was around the hoop.
[00:04:46] David Ulevitch: It was interested.
[00:04:47] David Ulevitch: And I think Garrett, the CEO of Flux Safety,
[00:04:50] David Ulevitch: called her the night before she was
[00:04:52] David Ulevitch: supposed to have Flux pitch to the general catalyst team.
[00:04:56] David Ulevitch: And it was like, oh, the deal got done.
[00:04:57] David Ulevitch: I'm going with Yule of it.
[00:04:58] David Ulevitch: She's an injury son, Horowitz and David George
[00:05:00] David Ulevitch: on the growth team.
[00:05:02] David Ulevitch: And she was like, damn, that's terrible.
[00:05:04] David Ulevitch: Like, foiled again twice.
[00:05:06] David Ulevitch: But Garrett was like, hey, maybe you should talk to Yule of it.
[00:05:08] David Ulevitch: Or maybe the two of you should join forces.
[00:05:10] David Ulevitch: So actually Garrett Langley at Flux Safety sort
[00:05:14] David Ulevitch: of reconnected Catherine and I, I reached out to her.
[00:05:17] David Ulevitch: I said, hey, look, Mark and Ben have always
[00:05:19] David Ulevitch: been super supportive of supporting the government,
[00:05:21] David Ulevitch: the national interest.
[00:05:23] David Ulevitch: They, Mark has been super involved, even from back in the Netscape
[00:05:27] David Ulevitch: days.
[00:05:27] David Ulevitch: Like, people don't know this.
[00:05:28] David Ulevitch: But back in Netscape, they helped pioneer SSL,
[00:05:31] David Ulevitch: like the little encryption icon in your web browser
[00:05:33] David Ulevitch: to do secure encrypted communications.
[00:05:36] David Ulevitch: And so like Ben as a product manager,
[00:05:38] David Ulevitch: Mark is the founder of Netscape.
[00:05:39] David Ulevitch: Even back then, they were building technology
[00:05:42] David Ulevitch: that was really important for our government
[00:05:43] David Ulevitch: to have secure communications.
[00:05:46] David Ulevitch: And they've always been supportive of that general philosophy.
[00:05:50] David Ulevitch: And so at the end of 2021, I reached out to Catherine and said,
[00:05:53] David Ulevitch: hey, I think we should join forces rather than the competitors.
[00:05:56] David Ulevitch: Let's make this a full-throwed effort.
[00:06:00] David Ulevitch: And Mark was like, at that point, fully fired up on it.
[00:06:04] David Ulevitch: Really, like, there was a lunch.
[00:06:06] David Ulevitch: We did it Mark's house with Catherine, me and Mark.
[00:06:08] David Ulevitch: And Mark was just like, everything that I said
[00:06:10] David Ulevitch: that I promised Catherine.
[00:06:11] David Ulevitch: Like, Mark was like, yes, and more.
[00:06:14] David Ulevitch: And so she joined at the end of 2021.
[00:06:16] David Ulevitch: And in the beginning of 2022, we launched the American
[00:06:18] David Ulevitch: Dynamism Practice.
[00:06:20] David Ulevitch: It wasn't a fun then.
[00:06:22] David Ulevitch: As Catherine would say, it was like a meme that
[00:06:24] David Ulevitch: was becoming a movement.
[00:06:26] David Ulevitch: And we announced that we had committed all this money to it.
[00:06:28] David Ulevitch: But we actually had no fun.
[00:06:29] David Ulevitch: We were just like borrowing venture dollars for it.
[00:06:33] David Ulevitch: But it turned out that our timing was excellent,
[00:06:35] David Ulevitch: because the world is getting spicier.
[00:06:39] David Ulevitch: The firm at that point was fully bought in.
[00:06:40] David Ulevitch: Like, Andrew, it was doing great.
[00:06:41] David Ulevitch: Flopk was doing great.
[00:06:44] David Ulevitch: And so Catherine had joined.
[00:06:46] David Ulevitch: And very shortly after that, we decided we wanted to raise a fund.
[00:06:50] David Ulevitch: We raised the first American Dynamism Fund.
[00:06:53] David Ulevitch: It was $660 million.
[00:06:56] David Ulevitch: And then we're now actually getting ready to go
[00:06:58] David Ulevitch: do our second fund.
[00:07:00] So you have a background in software and cybersecurity.
[00:07:03] This is not a traditional venture capital category.
[00:07:07] Molly O'Shea: How did you get the conviction to go after this
[00:07:10] Molly O'Shea: to get venture returns?
[00:07:11] Molly O'Shea: How does that work?
[00:07:13] David Ulevitch: Yeah, I think you have to look at when there's these moments.
[00:07:17] David Ulevitch: Like I always think of things as supply and demand.
[00:07:19] David Ulevitch: And you have to look at when there's these moments
[00:07:21] David Ulevitch: when there's technological shifts.
[00:07:23] David Ulevitch: So obviously, the defense industry
[00:07:24] David Ulevitch: has existed for a long time.
[00:07:26] David Ulevitch: But now we're now entering an era where
[00:07:28] David Ulevitch: you have much more advanced technologies.
[00:07:30] David Ulevitch: So AI, things that drive that like computer vision, autonomy,
[00:07:35] David Ulevitch: much lower cost of hardware, commodity hardware,
[00:07:38] David Ulevitch: some motors, manufacturing, production costs,
[00:07:40] David Ulevitch: all these things that can now be put into these legacy categories
[00:07:44] David Ulevitch: that previously had not been disrupted by advanced technology
[00:07:48] David Ulevitch: and where software can have a demonstrable impact on not
[00:07:50] David Ulevitch: just production time and margins, but even
[00:07:53] David Ulevitch: on the quality of the outcome.
[00:07:55] David Ulevitch: And so Andrew will fully appreciate it
[00:07:57] David Ulevitch: and understood that.
[00:07:58] David Ulevitch: That you could take essentially commodity hardware.
[00:08:00] David Ulevitch: Even though they're making their own solutions,
[00:08:02] David Ulevitch: they're using commodity hardware for most of the things.
[00:08:05] David Ulevitch: Now they're making using much more advanced hardware
[00:08:07] David Ulevitch: and bespoke hardware.
[00:08:08] David Ulevitch: But originally, it was largely commodity hardware.
[00:08:10] David Ulevitch: Their first century tower was essentially off the shelf parts
[00:08:13] David Ulevitch: that they put together with their advanced software.
[00:08:15] David Ulevitch: They built a coordination layer called lattice.
[00:08:18] David Ulevitch: And they said that we can do something
[00:08:20] David Ulevitch: to provide perimeter security that never existed before.
[00:08:24] David Ulevitch: And so when you have these moments
[00:08:26] David Ulevitch: where you're to technology, transformation moment,
[00:08:29] David Ulevitch: that really changes the supply side,
[00:08:31] David Ulevitch: where you have a lot more capability in technology.
[00:08:34] David Ulevitch: And we'll talk about the founders and talent
[00:08:36] David Ulevitch: side of the supply side of the equation in a second.
[00:08:38] David Ulevitch: But that really meant that we could change the way
[00:08:40] David Ulevitch: that we were providing solutions to the government.
[00:08:43] David Ulevitch: And then on the demand side, the government
[00:08:44] David Ulevitch: was at this watershed moment where they just recognized.
[00:08:47] David Ulevitch: And now it's a foregone conclusion.
[00:08:49] David Ulevitch: But even four or five years ago, the government was
[00:08:52] David Ulevitch: starting to wake up and realize, wait a minute,
[00:08:54] David Ulevitch: we cannot do things the way we've done things in the past.
[00:08:57] David Ulevitch: And you had COVID that highlighted all these supply chain
[00:09:00] David Ulevitch: issues where we also realized, wait a minute,
[00:09:03] David Ulevitch: whether it's caused by a pandemic or caused by economic
[00:09:06] David Ulevitch: sanctions or other or tariff issues or trade issues,
[00:09:09] David Ulevitch: we cannot rely on either adversaries or allies
[00:09:14] David Ulevitch: that are in ocean away supplying us with our critical raw
[00:09:18] David Ulevitch: ingredients we need to make things.
[00:09:21] And our adversaries are getting much more capable,
[00:09:23] David Ulevitch: much stronger.
[00:09:24] David Ulevitch: And so we need to be able to buy things in a different way.
[00:09:26] David Ulevitch: We need to buy different things into the demand side
[00:09:29] David Ulevitch: change as well.
[00:09:30] David Ulevitch: And we're now seeing that play out in a bunch of categories.
[00:09:33] David Ulevitch: The defense is a huge one.
[00:09:34] David Ulevitch: Space is another one.
[00:09:36] David Ulevitch: Obviously, we've been in space for a long time,
[00:09:38] David Ulevitch: but not in the way we are now.
[00:09:39] David Ulevitch: It is absolutely a new battle space.
[00:09:42] David Ulevitch: It's key for communications.
[00:09:43] David Ulevitch: It's key for observability.
[00:09:45] David Ulevitch: It's key for full awareness of what's happening around the globe
[00:09:48] David Ulevitch: and what's happening in space.
[00:09:50] David Ulevitch: And now as you, and then public safety is another example
[00:09:53] David Ulevitch: of a category where obviously policing
[00:09:56] David Ulevitch: has been done in many of the same ways for decades and decades
[00:10:00] David Ulevitch: and decades.
[00:10:00] David Ulevitch: But now you have AI that can dramatically
[00:10:02] David Ulevitch: change the way you do investigations,
[00:10:04] David Ulevitch: change the way you catch criminals, change the way
[00:10:07] David Ulevitch: that so many things happen that really improve police
[00:10:10] David Ulevitch: objectivity, improve the public safety.
[00:10:14] David Ulevitch: And so the demand side has just exploded
[00:10:16] David Ulevitch: in a need for new solutions.
[00:10:18] David Ulevitch: And then on the supply side, in addition
[00:10:20] David Ulevitch: to having all these new technologies and new capabilities,
[00:10:23] David Ulevitch: you actually have a base of talent that didn't exist
[00:10:25] David Ulevitch: before.
[00:10:26] David Ulevitch: All these people coming out of companies
[00:10:27] David Ulevitch: that sort of paved the way, like Palantir, Tesla, SpaceX,
[00:10:31] David Ulevitch: are now having all these alumni that are leaving
[00:10:33] David Ulevitch: and starting great companies.
[00:10:34] David Ulevitch: I mean, the founders of Androle came from Palantir,
[00:10:40] David Ulevitch: came from Oculus.
[00:10:42] David Ulevitch: And so it's really just, we're at a unique moment in time
[00:10:45] David Ulevitch: where the demands are high, the supply is there,
[00:10:49] David Ulevitch: and we can put them together with private capital.
[00:10:51] Constructing this fund is also a little bit more complicated
[00:10:54] Molly O'Shea: than a normal fund because of how close it
[00:10:56] Molly O'Shea: is to regulatory environment and all
[00:10:58] the different kinds of policies and going closer
[00:11:01] Molly O'Shea: to DC.
[00:11:02] Molly O'Shea: We've seen it in the last couple of years,
[00:11:04] Molly O'Shea: especially with the new administration,
[00:11:06] Molly O'Shea: there's really great connectivity between Silicon Valley
[00:11:08] Molly O'Shea: and DC.
[00:11:09] Molly O'Shea: But I'm curious from more of a structural standpoint,
[00:11:12] Molly O'Shea: how did you set up the fund and how do you help these companies
[00:11:15] Molly O'Shea: with policy?
[00:11:16] Yeah, I mean, look, I love working with entrepreneurs.
[00:11:19] David Ulevitch: Catherine loves working with entrepreneurs.
[00:11:21] David Ulevitch: Having a fund that is sized appropriately for the size
[00:11:24] David Ulevitch: of the opportunity has always been important in US.
[00:11:26] David Ulevitch: We think our opportunity set is actually just getting bigger.
[00:11:30] David Ulevitch: And there's more categories that we want
[00:11:31] David Ulevitch: to make sure we can make investments in.
[00:11:33] David Ulevitch: But a part of that is also making sure
[00:11:35] David Ulevitch: that we have the resources to support our companies
[00:11:37] David Ulevitch: in Washington is a really important place to do that.
[00:11:41] David Ulevitch: The firm has always been founded on this practice
[00:11:43] David Ulevitch: of how do we build the firm that we wish we had when we
[00:11:45] David Ulevitch: were entrepreneurs.
[00:11:46] David Ulevitch: And most of the leadership and in recent Horowitz
[00:11:50] David Ulevitch: were either founders of companies,
[00:11:51] David Ulevitch: ran companies, have technical backgrounds
[00:11:55] David Ulevitch: from Ben and Mark all the way across the board.
[00:11:58] And so we know, and I raise money for my own company,
[00:12:02] David Ulevitch: Ben and Mark raised money a couple of different times,
[00:12:05] David Ulevitch: Martin Kassada raised money out, you know, et cetera.
[00:12:07] David Ulevitch: And so we know what it's like to have a venture firm
[00:12:09] David Ulevitch: that's just treated, treats you like a financier.
[00:12:12] David Ulevitch: Like they just give you the money and then you're off
[00:12:13] David Ulevitch: on your own.
[00:12:14] David Ulevitch: We think there's a better way.
[00:12:15] David Ulevitch: And so one of the things we've done in the American Dynamism
[00:12:17] David Ulevitch: Fund without being too much of a shell, but obviously,
[00:12:21] David Ulevitch: I want to sell my own book, because I think it's a very good book.
[00:12:24] David Ulevitch: Is we've built out a policy team in DC.
[00:12:27] And there's work that we're really trying to advance
[00:12:29] David Ulevitch: that will benefit not just our companies,
[00:12:31] David Ulevitch: but all companies that are trying
[00:12:33] David Ulevitch: to build for the national interest.
[00:12:34] David Ulevitch: And ultimately, we think will benefit America.
[00:12:38] And I'm of the belief that anything that benefits America,
[00:12:40] David Ulevitch: benefits our allies and democracy in the whole world.
[00:12:45] David Ulevitch: I'm sure that I'll get like me and does a quote that will
[00:12:47] David Ulevitch: make fun of me later.

[00:15:14] David Ulevitch: But the idea of doing work in Washington
[00:15:17] David Ulevitch: is that there are structural problems,
[00:15:19] David Ulevitch: whether it's in defense procurement,
[00:15:21] David Ulevitch: whether it's in how the selection process goes,
[00:15:26] David Ulevitch: how the appropriations process goes,
[00:15:28] David Ulevitch: and there's work that we can do.
[00:15:29] David Ulevitch: How, I mean, you see this with some of the DOGE effort,
[00:15:31] David Ulevitch: like how do you make sure that you have the right people
[00:15:33] David Ulevitch: and the right jobs and not have the wrong people
[00:15:35] David Ulevitch: and the wrong jobs.
[00:15:37] David Ulevitch: There's just a lot of work that structurally has to change
[00:15:39] David Ulevitch: in Washington.
[00:15:40] David Ulevitch: And so we have a policy team that is really helping
[00:15:43] David Ulevitch: to understand the issues and that advance changes
[00:15:47] David Ulevitch: from a legislative standpoint or from an education standpoint
[00:15:50] David Ulevitch: to drive those changes.
[00:15:51] David Ulevitch: So defense procurement, I would say,
[00:15:53] David Ulevitch: is the biggest issue for the AD fund.
[00:15:55] David Ulevitch: There's a ton of work happening in AI and crypto elsewhere
[00:15:58] David Ulevitch: in the firm and they all work together hand in hand
[00:16:01] David Ulevitch: to try to have a unified view to advance,
[00:16:03] David Ulevitch: not just the interests of our firm,
[00:16:06] David Ulevitch: but what we think of the interests of all startups
[00:16:09] David Ulevitch: across the country.
[00:16:10] David Ulevitch: How do the capital commitments from the government
[00:16:13] Molly O'Shea: then bleed into this or like a collaborate
[00:16:16] Molly O'Shea: with these kinds of investments?
[00:16:17] Molly O'Shea: Because there have been really big commitments.
[00:16:19] Molly O'Shea: Yeah, so I think people,
[00:16:22] David Ulevitch: so the government wants to create a culture of accountability.
[00:16:27] David Ulevitch: And that comes with a lot of challenges actually.
[00:16:30] David Ulevitch: And those challenges are better solved with private capital.
[00:16:33] David Ulevitch: So an example is if the government gives you $50 million
[00:16:37] David Ulevitch: for an R&D project to go try to create a prototype of something,
[00:16:40] David Ulevitch: they want to make sure you're spending the money wisely.
[00:16:42] David Ulevitch: So that $50 million comes with a kind of overhead
[00:16:45] David Ulevitch: of auditing, accounting, tons of oversight.
[00:16:48] David Ulevitch: And as a taxpayer, that feels totally appropriate.
[00:16:51] David Ulevitch: But it's so burdensome for a small company.
[00:16:53] David Ulevitch: It's almost impossible for these small companies
[00:16:54] David Ulevitch: to cope with that level of oversight.
[00:16:58] David Ulevitch: And so that's why most of the time,
[00:16:59] David Ulevitch: these big contracts just go to the primes
[00:17:02] David Ulevitch: and the primes have all this structural kind of systems
[00:17:05] David Ulevitch: built up to deal with that.
[00:17:06] David Ulevitch: So they love the system, they love the oversight,
[00:17:08] David Ulevitch: they love it.
[00:17:09] David Ulevitch: And by the way, they just charge more for the contracts
[00:17:11] David Ulevitch: because they have all this overhead and accounting
[00:17:13] David Ulevitch: and auditing that happens.
[00:17:15] David Ulevitch: And then ultimately results in a poor experience
[00:17:17] David Ulevitch: for the taxpayer because we don't get the best products,
[00:17:19] David Ulevitch: we don't get them quickly and we don't get them on budget.
[00:17:22] David Ulevitch: Where private capital instead is, I think,
[00:17:23] David Ulevitch: a much better alternative is we say, look,
[00:17:26] if you don't pay for the R&D, you just buy the finished product.
[00:17:29] David Ulevitch: All you have to do is commit to buying the finished product.
[00:17:31] David Ulevitch: We'll fund the R&D and you can get rid of all the auditing
[00:17:35] David Ulevitch: and accounting and constant oversight that you provide.
[00:17:38] David Ulevitch: Because that's our job, this private capital.
[00:17:39] David Ulevitch: We'll make sure that we're good stewards
[00:17:42] David Ulevitch: of our capital and our investors capital.
[00:17:44] David Ulevitch: So you can save the government so much money
[00:17:46] David Ulevitch: and we are better pickers of who's
[00:17:48] David Ulevitch: going to deliver great technology than the government is.
[00:17:51] David Ulevitch: And that's because we've been doing it a lot longer.
[00:17:53] David Ulevitch: We know the founders were able to evaluate them.
[00:17:54] David Ulevitch: That's like our entire existence as investors.
[00:17:59] David Ulevitch: And so I think private capital is just a much better model.
[00:18:02] David Ulevitch: And all we need from the government
[00:18:03] David Ulevitch: is we don't need them to fund R&D.
[00:18:05] David Ulevitch: We need them to commit to buying outcomes and buying
[00:18:08] David Ulevitch: solutions.
[00:18:10] David Ulevitch: And so one of the defense reforms we're pushing
[00:18:13] David Ulevitch: is that it's very common in defense procurement
[00:18:17] David Ulevitch: to say, or even any kind of government procurement,
[00:18:19] David Ulevitch: to say, what have you delivered in the past
[00:18:21] David Ulevitch: is an important criteria for deciding
[00:18:23] David Ulevitch: if you get awarded a contract for the future.
[00:18:25] David Ulevitch: But a lot of startups have been delivered
[00:18:26] David Ulevitch: to anything in the past.
[00:18:27] David Ulevitch: And so then it really benefits the legacy incumbents
[00:18:31] David Ulevitch: and doesn't give a chance for a startup to deliver.
[00:18:33] David Ulevitch: And so we were pushing for changes and say,
[00:18:35] David Ulevitch: hey, look, why don't you do bake offs?
[00:18:36] David Ulevitch: Why don't you do competitions?
[00:18:37] David Ulevitch: And if a startup shows up with the best product,
[00:18:39] David Ulevitch: just pick that one.
[00:18:41] That's one example.
[00:18:42] David Ulevitch: Another example is the government often says,
[00:18:46] David Ulevitch: we're going to appropriate money for this specific product.
[00:18:50] David Ulevitch: When what they should really say is,
[00:18:51] David Ulevitch: we're going to appropriate money for something
[00:18:53] David Ulevitch: that solves this problem.
[00:18:55] David Ulevitch: And then let the actual customer, whether it's
[00:18:57] David Ulevitch: so-com or Indo-Paycom or the intelligence community,
[00:19:00] David Ulevitch: whatever it is, let them decide what the right solution is.
[00:19:04] David Ulevitch: And then, again, hold a bake off, hold a competition,
[00:19:06] David Ulevitch: hold an RFP, and get the right solution.
[00:19:09] David Ulevitch: But don't appropriate specific exact precise products
[00:19:12] David Ulevitch: from a specific vendor.
[00:19:14] David Ulevitch: But instead, just focus on where the solution is
[00:19:16] David Ulevitch: and let the customer at the time that they need to actually
[00:19:19] David Ulevitch: buy it, decide what the right solution is.
[00:19:20] David Ulevitch: Because those things change.
[00:19:22] If you look at the war in the Ukraine,
[00:19:25] David Ulevitch: you'll see that the evolution of drone warfare
[00:19:27] David Ulevitch: and the battlefield has changed dramatically.
[00:19:29] David Ulevitch: If you look at the government's appropriations
[00:19:32] David Ulevitch: from five years ago, there was nothing
[00:19:33] David Ulevitch: about a very little about like a tritable drones
[00:19:38] David Ulevitch: in electronic warfare to deal with the massive influx
[00:19:41] David Ulevitch: of drones that are being sent at soldiers.
[00:19:43] David Ulevitch: But that's what the people on the battlefield need today.
[00:19:45] David Ulevitch: And they want solutions for that today.
[00:19:47] David Ulevitch: And so you need to have an appropriations process
[00:19:50] David Ulevitch: that actually is geared toward being able to produce
[00:19:52] David Ulevitch: those kinds of solutions.
[00:19:54] Private capital is now flowing in massively.
[00:19:58] Molly O'Shea: There is just like a swath coming in now
[00:20:00] Molly O'Shea: that a pretty big deal, but JP Morgan just committed,
[00:20:05] Molly O'Shea: or is going to commit $1.5 trillion,
[00:20:08] Molly O'Shea: whereas the category?
[00:20:09] Molly O'Shea: The one and a half trillion is like a huge amount of capital.
[00:20:11] David Ulevitch: It's a huge amount of money.
[00:20:13] David Ulevitch: And I think that what we're seeing is an American,
[00:20:16] David Ulevitch: and I think they went out of their way,
[00:20:17] David Ulevitch: not to use words, dynamism.
[00:20:18] David Ulevitch: People sometimes don't want to call it American dynamism,
[00:20:20] David Ulevitch: even though it's obviously American dynamism.
[00:20:22] David Ulevitch: But I think that this movement is really taken hold.
[00:20:27] David Ulevitch: And I think that it's taken hold for a bunch of reasons.
[00:20:29] David Ulevitch: One is that there's just increasing realization,
[00:20:32] David Ulevitch: whether you look at what's happening in the Ukraine,
[00:20:34] David Ulevitch: where you look at what's happening
[00:20:35] David Ulevitch: from across the Pacific Ocean and China,
[00:20:38] David Ulevitch: their ability to build ships is much, much faster than ours.
[00:20:42] David Ulevitch: A lot of the raw materials we need for our own shipbuilding
[00:20:44] David Ulevitch: comes from China, the steel, and then the metals.
[00:20:48] David Ulevitch: A lot of the things we need for batteries, for motors,
[00:20:50] David Ulevitch: for a lot of the ingredients we need to actually make
[00:20:53] David Ulevitch: that drones we want to make, and get how to use vehicles
[00:20:55] David Ulevitch: we want to make.
[00:20:57] David Ulevitch: They all come from China.
[00:20:59] David Ulevitch: And so it's not just about defense procurement,
[00:21:01] David Ulevitch: but as we look a little bit to the left,
[00:21:04] David Ulevitch: what we see is like, oh, wait a minute, we need batteries.
[00:21:07] David Ulevitch: We need batteries for lots of things.
[00:21:08] David Ulevitch: We have this insatiable thirst to electrify our world,
[00:21:11] David Ulevitch: whether it's AI-computed electric vehicles,
[00:21:14] David Ulevitch: home energy resilience, it doesn't matter,
[00:21:16] David Ulevitch: we need batteries.
[00:21:17] David Ulevitch: And if they all come from China,
[00:21:19] David Ulevitch: and we ever get into a real conflict with China,
[00:21:20] David Ulevitch: whether it's an economic conflict or an actual
[00:21:22] David Ulevitch: kinetic conflict, they're going to cut us off.
[00:21:26] David Ulevitch: And so we need to have resilience for those things.
[00:21:28] David Ulevitch: And I think what you see with the JP Morgan announcement
[00:21:31] David Ulevitch: is just now broad skill recognition
[00:21:33] David Ulevitch: that we need to be investing these areas.
[00:21:35] David Ulevitch: And in fact, private capital is one of the best ways
[00:21:37] David Ulevitch: to do that.
[00:21:38] David Ulevitch: And I think there's going to be incredible returns
[00:21:40] David Ulevitch: for the investors who do that,
[00:21:41] David Ulevitch: whether it's mining, manufacturing, supply chain,
[00:21:47] David Ulevitch: logistics and production components, robotics,
[00:21:52] David Ulevitch: autonomy, you name it, plus all the categories
[00:21:55] David Ulevitch: we already invest in, defense, space,
[00:21:57] David Ulevitch: public safety, energy, et cetera.
[00:21:59] David Ulevitch: One of the biggest bottlenecks for these types of companies
[00:22:01] Molly O'Shea: was always late stage capital.
[00:22:04] Does this now give your LPs and your different investors
[00:22:07] Molly O'Shea: more security or at least confidence
[00:22:10] Molly O'Shea: in playing the long game with this?
[00:22:12] Molly O'Shea: It certainly should.
[00:22:13] David Ulevitch: I think that the LPs often bring up
[00:22:18] David Ulevitch: like what is the exit going to look like for these companies.
[00:22:21] David Ulevitch: And I think it's a good question to ask
[00:22:22] David Ulevitch: and it's one that we take seriously.
[00:22:25] David Ulevitch: What we're already seeing in the market is,
[00:22:27] David Ulevitch: these companies are ramping their revenue faster
[00:22:29] David Ulevitch: than companies have in these categories ever before.
[00:22:31] David Ulevitch: The opportunity size keeps getting larger and larger
[00:22:34] David Ulevitch: and larger.
[00:22:36] David Ulevitch: And while it's like,
[00:22:37] David Ulevitch: and we're also seeing companies going public.
[00:22:39] David Ulevitch: And so I think that we're at a moment now
[00:22:41] David Ulevitch: where I worry less every day about the exit outcomes
[00:22:45] David Ulevitch: for these companies.
[00:22:46] David Ulevitch: I mean, obviously it's something we care about.
[00:22:47] David Ulevitch: We make investments to ultimately get liquidity.
[00:22:49] David Ulevitch: But when you look at a company like SpaceX
[00:22:51] David Ulevitch: that's still private, I think now investors recognize,
[00:22:54] David Ulevitch: and they just had an incredible launch yesterday.
[00:22:57] David Ulevitch: Like I think now investors recognize
[00:22:58] David Ulevitch: this is one of the transformative companies
[00:23:01] David Ulevitch: in this country at a dollar invested in SpaceX
[00:23:04] David Ulevitch: as a dollar put to a good place.
[00:23:08] David Ulevitch: And I think the same is true
[00:23:09] David Ulevitch: from any of these other categories
[00:23:10] David Ulevitch: and many of these other companies.
[00:23:11] David Ulevitch: So I hope that LPs see it that way.
[00:23:14] David Ulevitch: I hope that they see that it's not just a good investment,
[00:23:17] David Ulevitch: but it's also, like for me,
[00:23:20] David Ulevitch: it's not just a good investment,
[00:23:21] David Ulevitch: but it's not even just that it's good for America.
[00:23:24] David Ulevitch: But if you actually don't have these foundational components
[00:23:27] David Ulevitch: that are rock solid here in this country,
[00:23:29] David Ulevitch: everything else falls apart.
[00:23:30] David Ulevitch: Like all the B2Bs, SAs falls apart,
[00:23:32] David Ulevitch: all the ad click optimization to a fall apart.
[00:23:34] David Ulevitch: Like if you don't have a strong democracy,
[00:23:36] David Ulevitch: if you don't have a strong economy in a strong country,
[00:23:38] David Ulevitch: like all the stuff on top falls apart.
[00:23:40] David Ulevitch: You need to have public safety, you need to have defense,
[00:23:42] David Ulevitch: you need to have energy, reliability.
[00:23:46] David Ulevitch: And so I think all these things are actually critical
[00:23:48] David Ulevitch: even for all the stuff that just sits on top
[00:23:49] David Ulevitch: that we all benefit from.
[00:23:51] How has AI impacted this category?
[00:23:54] Molly O'Shea: Carter has some incredible data on this
[00:23:55] Molly O'Shea: that 41% of companies see in Serie A,
[00:23:58] Molly O'Shea: Serie A are all AI, quote unquote AI company gift.
[00:24:03] Molly O'Shea: But how does this impact this category
[00:24:05] Molly O'Shea: since that's like such a large driver of,
[00:24:09] Molly O'Shea: let's say investments and then also like new teams?
[00:24:12] Molly O'Shea: So I think you can look from any dimension
[00:24:14] David Ulevitch: and recognize that AI is transforming
[00:24:17] David Ulevitch: all of these categories as it should.
[00:24:20] David Ulevitch: So if you started the most fundamental level,
[00:24:22] David Ulevitch: like energy, we just have an insatiable
[00:24:24] David Ulevitch: thirst for energy in this country.
[00:24:25] David Ulevitch: And AI compute is driving a huge amount of it.
[00:24:28] David Ulevitch: Part of the shift to electric vehicles,
[00:24:30] David Ulevitch: obviously we have EVs today.
[00:24:32] David Ulevitch: That's we shift to more autonomous vehicles.
[00:24:34] David Ulevitch: All those vehicles are gonna be electric as well.
[00:24:37] David Ulevitch: And so that drives it as well.
[00:24:39] David Ulevitch: People now recognize you see that natural disasters
[00:24:41] David Ulevitch: are getting worse and people want more resilience
[00:24:43] David Ulevitch: and the grid.
[00:24:44] David Ulevitch: So they wanna have home battery systems
[00:24:46] David Ulevitch: so that when the grid is either too expensive
[00:24:48] David Ulevitch: or offline, their home can stay online.
[00:24:52] David Ulevitch: And so you see more and more people deploying batteries.
[00:24:54] David Ulevitch: So like energy need, like AI is driving
[00:24:57] David Ulevitch: this massive energy boom in this country.
[00:24:59] David Ulevitch: And I think I've seen a chart where commercial real estate
[00:25:03] David Ulevitch: construction is like petered off and dropping,
[00:25:05] David Ulevitch: but like data center construction is like just asymptoting,
[00:25:08] David Ulevitch: you know, going through the roof.
[00:25:10] David Ulevitch: And that's not being driven by AI compute.
[00:25:12] David Ulevitch: And that AI compute will then power lots of things.
[00:25:14] David Ulevitch: It's not just gonna power a chat GBT,
[00:25:16] David Ulevitch: but it's gonna power autonomy systems,
[00:25:18] David Ulevitch: all kinds of other language models
[00:25:20] David Ulevitch: and all of their kinds of use cases.
[00:25:21] David Ulevitch: Then if you look at defense, computer vision,
[00:25:24] David Ulevitch: transforming the battlefield,
[00:25:26] David Ulevitch: and real-headed announcement yesterday,
[00:25:27] David Ulevitch: it's like called EGLY,
[00:25:29] David Ulevitch: which is their new body-worn headset.
[00:25:31] David Ulevitch: That is like, I don't know if it's commodity objects
[00:25:34] David Ulevitch: or specialized objects, but it's definitely very advanced AI
[00:25:37] David Ulevitch: software in a way that the warfighter has never been able
[00:25:40] David Ulevitch: to utilize in the past.
[00:25:41] David Ulevitch: And this will save lives for the men and women who serve.
[00:25:44] David Ulevitch: And it will also make us the most, you know, I would say,
[00:25:47] David Ulevitch: like you want our forces to be the most like capable forces
[00:25:50] David Ulevitch: out of the battlefield so that they can win decisive victories.
[00:25:54] David Ulevitch: And so having AI to augment the warfighter
[00:25:57] David Ulevitch: will help them tremendously.
[00:25:58] David Ulevitch: You see this in drones.
[00:26:00] David Ulevitch: Like it's easy for one pilot to control like a little
[00:26:02] David Ulevitch: like hobbyist DJI drone if they want.
[00:26:04] David Ulevitch: They shouldn't use a DJI drone,
[00:26:06] David Ulevitch: but like we know they do.
[00:26:07] David Ulevitch: But as we start moving to swarms of drones,
[00:26:10] David Ulevitch: thousands of drones, you're gonna need AI
[00:26:11] David Ulevitch: to coordinate all those things.
[00:26:12] David Ulevitch: So it's transforming the way we think of drone warfare,
[00:26:17] David Ulevitch: whether it's from a kinetic standpoint
[00:26:19] David Ulevitch: or even just like an ISR, like search and reconnaissance
[00:26:21] David Ulevitch: standpoint, autonomy is gonna transform all of that.
[00:26:24] David Ulevitch: Then you see AI transforming even just logistics.
[00:26:28] David Ulevitch: One thing that like we have a company called Airspace
[00:26:31] David Ulevitch: Intelligence and you read about how like the FAA needs
[00:26:34] David Ulevitch: rapid modernization, well, Airspace Intelligence does
[00:26:36] David Ulevitch: flight operations and planning using AI.
[00:26:39] David Ulevitch: So you can have the most efficient flight planning
[00:26:42] David Ulevitch: save the most amount of fuel,
[00:26:43] David Ulevitch: make sure that the least amount of flights get canceled.
[00:26:46] David Ulevitch: And right now a lot of that kind of work for airlines
[00:26:48] David Ulevitch: happens in spreadsheets, but Airspace Intelligence uses
[00:26:50] David Ulevitch: the AI to do it all programmatically and automatically.
[00:26:53] David Ulevitch: And so there's just all these categories
[00:26:55] David Ulevitch: where AI is just transformative.
[00:26:58] David Ulevitch: I'll give you one more example in public safety.
[00:27:01] David Ulevitch: We've had license plate reading cameras for a long time
[00:27:03] David Ulevitch: in public safety, but they've never been very good.
[00:27:05] David Ulevitch: Flux safety uses AI to be able to do like free form search.
[00:27:09] David Ulevitch: You can say instead of saying, you know,
[00:27:11] David Ulevitch: you might know that a car pulled up in a Rob DeGaustation,
[00:27:15] David Ulevitch: but the camera of the gas station is so crappy,
[00:27:17] David Ulevitch: you can't read the license plate
[00:27:19] David Ulevitch: because they have just like bad cameras.
[00:27:20] David Ulevitch: But instead you can say, oh, that's like a silver
[00:27:22] David Ulevitch: camera with aftermarket rims and a spoiler.
[00:27:25] David Ulevitch: Well, that AI can take that text
[00:27:27] David Ulevitch: and then go through it to a full image search
[00:27:28] David Ulevitch: and find the right silver camera.
[00:27:31] David Ulevitch: That helps police, they don't pull over the wrong silver
[00:27:33] David Ulevitch: camera, but obviously helps communities
[00:27:35] David Ulevitch: because it gets criminals off the street.
[00:27:37] David Ulevitch: And so AI is just transforming all of these industry
[00:27:39] David Ulevitch: dramatically, and you know,
[00:27:41] David Ulevitch: and we're all the beneficiaries.
