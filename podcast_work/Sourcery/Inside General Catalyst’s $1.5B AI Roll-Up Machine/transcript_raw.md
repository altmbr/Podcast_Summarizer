[00:00:00] GC is one of the three largest venture players.
[00:00:02] SPEAKER_00: We put up to work about a billion and a half
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_00: on the creation strategy.
[00:00:06] SPEAKER_00: And first and foremost, it's really around incubating companies.
[00:00:08] SPEAKER_00: There's a ton of potential right now,
[00:00:10] SPEAKER_00: especially to incubate applied AI companies.
[00:00:13] SPEAKER_00: So as the models get better, whether it's open AI
[00:00:15] SPEAKER_00: or Anthropic or Google or XAI or others,
[00:00:18] SPEAKER_00: we really do think there'll be a lot of new companies
[00:00:20] SPEAKER_00: that can be built on top of this technology.
[00:00:22] SPEAKER_00: There's a huge opportunity on creation
[00:00:24] SPEAKER_00: to incubate applied AI companies.
[00:00:25] SPEAKER_00: When we do that, we go one of two ways.
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_00: Either we incubate the applied AI company
[00:00:29] SPEAKER_00: and we have it scale organically
[00:00:31] SPEAKER_00: and then we give them capital for marketing and growth.
[00:00:33] SPEAKER_00: Or that second part has begun to be called AI-enabled rollup.
[00:00:37] SPEAKER_00: And obviously we are extremely involved in companies
[00:00:39] SPEAKER_00: like Long Lake, UDIA, Titan MSP, Beacon,
[00:00:43] SPEAKER_00: Crescendo and others who are kind of the leaders now
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_00: in this field.
[00:00:46] SPEAKER_00: At GC, we've been investing between 100 and 150 million,
[00:00:49] SPEAKER_00: but over three or four rounds of funding.
[00:00:52] SPEAKER_00: We like to lead at least the first two
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_00: and then we start bringing in other investors
[00:00:55] SPEAKER_00: and the third or the fourth.
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_00: We think in this much larger tan than software
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_00: you can have software like margins.
[00:01:01] SPEAKER_00: Because once you take out 30, 40, 50% of what people do
[00:01:04] SPEAKER_00: and free them up to do the hard stuff,
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_00: you can double the revenue.
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_00: Unlike private equity, we screen really hard for,
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_00: does this company want to change?
[00:01:11] SPEAKER_00: Do they want to implement AI?
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_00: And then of course we want to hold them for seven to 10 years
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_00: and go public and not necessarily at debt and cut costs.
[00:01:17] SPEAKER_00: Some of the companies in the rollup
[00:01:19] SPEAKER_00: will hit 100 million of EBITDA
[00:01:20] SPEAKER_00: and they're like less than two years old.
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_00: Oh my God.
[00:01:23] !
[00:01:24] Mark Bargava, welcome to Sorcery.
[00:01:35] SPEAKER_02: Thanks for having me.
[00:01:37] Well, this is fun.
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_02: This is great.
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_02: I've been waiting to do this for a while now.
[00:01:41] SPEAKER_02: You are the Managing Director, General Catalyst.
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_02: You are a Managing Director.
[00:01:46] SPEAKER_02: Yes, I'm sorry.
[00:01:47] SPEAKER_02: General Catalyst.
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_00: Actress.
[00:01:50] I don't think many people know the breadth
[00:01:53] SPEAKER_02: of General Catalyst's asset management function.
[00:01:57] SPEAKER_02: So could you just break down how it's structured?
[00:02:00] Yeah, sure.
[00:02:00] I can talk a little bit about GC and how
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_00: we're set up, what we're all working on.
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_00: So we were a venture capital firm,
[00:02:07] SPEAKER_00: but we're evolving to be really a company.
[00:02:09] SPEAKER_00: And people ask me, well, what does that mean?
[00:02:11] SPEAKER_00: There are two big parts to it.
[00:02:12] SPEAKER_00: As a company, one, we're actually
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_00: building companies for the long term.
[00:02:16] So folks have seen the announcement
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_00: about us buying a hospital system in Ohio, for example.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_00: We did that through an organization called HACCO,
[00:02:23] SPEAKER_00: which we incubated and then bought a hospital.
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_00: And we planned to hold that for a really long period of time.
[00:02:28] SPEAKER_00: We have a wealth management business that we've set up
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_00: to help founders manage their money.
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_00: That's another company we've built in house
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_00: that we planned to hold for a very long time.
[00:02:35] SPEAKER_00: And then finally, we have now an AI consulting business
[00:02:38] SPEAKER_00: called Persepta.
[00:02:39] SPEAKER_00: That really comes in and changes Fortune 100 companies,
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_00: helps implement AI, really leverages everything we've learned
[00:02:45] SPEAKER_00: from AI investing.
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_00: And that's another company we've built in house
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_00: that we will hold for a really long time,
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_00: maybe forever in these cases.
[00:02:52] SPEAKER_00: So GC as a company is building in house,
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_00: what we call transformation companies,
[00:02:57] SPEAKER_00: with these three being examples of businesses
[00:02:59] SPEAKER_00: we think should exist, are good for society.
[00:03:02] SPEAKER_00: We're not planning on taking them public.
[00:03:04] SPEAKER_00: We want to hold them for a really long time.
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_00: In addition to these three transformation companies,
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_00: we have another bucket where we're probably better known for,
[00:03:10] SPEAKER_00: which is our funds.
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_00: And so there we have the traditional venture funds,
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_00: ignition on the early stage, endurance for later stage.
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_00: We also have a customer value fund
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_00: for helping companies scale really quickly,
[00:03:22] SPEAKER_00: which we can talk about.
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_00: And then lastly, where I'm focused is on the creation,
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_00: which is part of our funds business.
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_00: And creation has been a very fast growing fund for us
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_00: because it's all about manufacturing outliers.
[00:03:33] SPEAKER_00: So while our venture funds are always looking
[00:03:35] SPEAKER_00: for the next great company or person,
[00:03:37] SPEAKER_00: we on the creation side are incubating companies,
[00:03:40] SPEAKER_00: but ones that we would want to take public in seven to 10 years.
[00:03:43] SPEAKER_00: So they're not necessarily companies we majority own
[00:03:46] SPEAKER_00: or we would hold forever,
[00:03:47] SPEAKER_00: but their businesses we think really should exist
[00:03:50] SPEAKER_00: that we're creating through creation
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_00: that we want to go and take public in seven to 10 years.
[00:03:54] SPEAKER_00: And most of the time they don't exist
[00:03:56] SPEAKER_00: because there's not enough capital for it
[00:03:58] SPEAKER_00: or it's multidisciplinary,
[00:04:00] SPEAKER_00: so it really requires a lot of different expertise
[00:04:02] SPEAKER_00: or it's a bit more traditional or outside the box,
[00:04:05] SPEAKER_00: things like the AI rollups
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_00: that we're working on these new pieces of spaces
[00:04:08] SPEAKER_00: that just haven't really happened yet.
[00:04:10] SPEAKER_00: So creation is where I spend most of my time.
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_00: But GC as an organization,
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_00: we truly are a company now,
[00:04:15] SPEAKER_00: building companies for long term,
[00:04:17] SPEAKER_00: creating and incubating companies
[00:04:18] SPEAKER_00: that we want to take public in the future.
[00:04:20] SPEAKER_00: So how large is this?
[00:04:22] SPEAKER_02: And with the company as a new structure,
[00:04:25] SPEAKER_02: will you be weighing it with AUM?
[00:04:27] SPEAKER_02: Like how does this differentiate?
[00:04:29] So we're kind of one of the three largest venture players.
[00:04:32] SPEAKER_00: The way we really view it is on the returns for our investors.
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_00: So our venture funds have to outperform and do really well
[00:04:39] SPEAKER_00: to attract more LPs,
[00:04:41] SPEAKER_00: obviously to attract more founders.
[00:04:43] SPEAKER_00: The nice thing is that all of these pieces do tie together
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_00: with really one question,
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_00: which is what are the best ways to work with the most founders
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_00: and help them the most?
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_00: And the answer to that question,
[00:04:52] SPEAKER_00: we try to plug and match both the companies
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_00: and the venture funds.
[00:04:55] SPEAKER_00: So for example, if you're a founder
[00:04:57] SPEAKER_00: and you have a tech business and you're growing quickly,
[00:05:00] SPEAKER_00: maybe you use our wealth management transformation company
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_00: to manage your money.
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_00: Maybe you use Percepta to help you create your own mini model
[00:05:07] SPEAKER_00: or inference or kind of improve your technology stack.
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_00: Percepta can come in and really help with that.
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_00: Maybe if you're in help care,
[00:05:13] SPEAKER_00: you decide to sell into our hospital system in Ohio
[00:05:16] SPEAKER_00: and be able to test out your technology.
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_00: So the transformation companies that we build in house in GC
[00:05:22] SPEAKER_00: are ultimately also helping our founders
[00:05:24] SPEAKER_00: while delivering value for the investors in GC.
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_00: And same on the venture side,
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_00: not every founder has the perfect idea and their scaling.
[00:05:33] SPEAKER_00: Some founders are second time founders
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_00: thinking about their next thing.
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_00: So with creation, we help give them the idea,
[00:05:37] SPEAKER_00: we introduce them to their co-founder,
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_00: we help them even before the capital formation.
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_00: And on the other hand, if you're already growing really quickly
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_00: and you want a way to scale without as much dilution,
[00:05:47] SPEAKER_00: our customer value fund helps with that.
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_00: So GC is doing a lot of things at once.
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_00: We've hired an incredible people
[00:05:53] SPEAKER_00: for each transformation company, for each fund product.
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_00: But ultimately, we now feel like if you're successfully
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_00: growing and running a company,
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_00: there are more ways to partner with GC
[00:06:03] SPEAKER_00: than any other firm out there.
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_00: And because of that, we're really seeing our brand rise,
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_00: we're seeing the founders we back
[00:06:09] SPEAKER_00: be extremely high quality and their companies do well,
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_00: because there are just so many more ways to plug in
[00:06:13] SPEAKER_00: and work with GC than with an individual solo venture fund.
[00:06:18] With your focus on the creation side of things,
[00:06:20] SPEAKER_02: how much have you allocated to creation?
[00:06:23] SPEAKER_02: In our last ones, I go, we put up to work
[00:06:25] SPEAKER_00: about a billion and a half on the creation strategy.
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_00: And first and foremost, it's really around incubating companies.
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_00: So we think there's a ton of potential right now,
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_00: especially to incubate applied AI companies.
[00:06:36] SPEAKER_00: So as the models get better, whether it's open AI
[00:06:38] SPEAKER_00: here in Thropic or Google or XAI or others,
[00:06:42] we really do think there'll be a lot of new companies
[00:06:44] SPEAKER_00: that can be built on top of this technology.
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_00: And every three to six months, the models
[00:06:48] SPEAKER_00: are getting better and better, especially recently
[00:06:50] SPEAKER_00: at things like reasoning, logic, coding, math.
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_00: And so we think there's a huge opportunity on creation
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_00: to incubate applied AI companies.
[00:06:59] SPEAKER_00: And when we do that, we go one of two ways.
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_00: Either we incubate the applied AI company
[00:07:03] SPEAKER_00: and we have it scale organically,
[00:07:05] SPEAKER_00: and then we give them capital for marketing and growth,
[00:07:07] SPEAKER_00: or in about half the cases after incubating
[00:07:10] SPEAKER_00: an applied AI company, we actually give them capital
[00:07:12] SPEAKER_00: to go by their distribution, by their client list
[00:07:15] SPEAKER_00: and the data that comes there.
[00:07:16] SPEAKER_00: And so that second part has begun to be called
[00:07:19] SPEAKER_00: the AI enabled roll up.
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_00: And obviously we are extremely involved in companies
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_00: like Long Lake, UDIA, Titan MSP, Beacon,
[00:07:26] SPEAKER_00: Crescendo, and others who are kind of the leaders now
[00:07:29] SPEAKER_00: in this field.
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_00: Wow.
[00:07:30] SPEAKER_00: I think what would be really interesting would be
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_02: to take us up back because general catalyst
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_02: really leaned into this moment.
[00:07:39] SPEAKER_02: People have forgotten about this,
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_02: but there was an existential moment for SaaS
[00:07:44] SPEAKER_02: in early 2023 or something like that.
[00:07:47] SPEAKER_02: And everyone thought venture was dead, SaaS was dead.
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_02: It was the end of everything.
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_02: No more venture capital, it's over.
[00:07:56] SPEAKER_02: That was the whole idea.
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_02: But then some people thought, oh, no, this is an opportunity.
[00:08:01] SPEAKER_02: This is an opportunity to roll up companies,
[00:08:04] SPEAKER_02: to apply AI, to use these efficiencies.
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_02: And one of those people or one of those funds
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_02: was general catalyst.
[00:08:11] SPEAKER_02: And so you guys actually really leaned in hard for this.
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_02: What was the decision making process for it?
[00:08:16] Yeah, for us it was a boat strategy.
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_00: So we actually think three approaches can win.
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_00: One, some folks view it as the model companies
[00:08:23] SPEAKER_00: will end up being the winners.
[00:08:24] SPEAKER_00: They're going to keep iterating, make better and better
[00:08:27] SPEAKER_00: models, they'll go direct to the consumer.
[00:08:29] SPEAKER_00: And we're obviously investors in Anthropic,
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_00: large investors in the last round, from this current round.
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_00: We absolutely think companies like Anthropic and OpenAI
[00:08:36] SPEAKER_00: and Google can benefit and the model layer can benefit.
[00:08:39] SPEAKER_00: So we agree with that.
[00:08:40] SPEAKER_00: We also agree with folks who say, well,
[00:08:42] SPEAKER_00: it's been overestimated.
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_00: SaaS is not dead.
[00:08:45] SPEAKER_00: If you look at public market comps, they've
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_00: continued to grow, do well.
[00:08:48] SPEAKER_00: There are all kinds of new, interesting SaaS companies
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_00: that are being started and growing.
[00:08:52] But we also think there is this third bucket.
[00:08:54] SPEAKER_00: So we're kind of in all of the above.
[00:08:56] SPEAKER_00: We think there'll be winners in each category.
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_00: We obviously want to be part of them.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_00: But that third bucket is for really fragmented industries,
[00:09:03] SPEAKER_00: where it's very hard to sell into AI native services
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_00: and products.
[00:09:07] SPEAKER_00: Can we actually build the AI native service platform
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_00: and software and then go buy our distribution?
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_00: So a few examples.
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_00: One that was very early on was Crescendo,
[00:09:16] SPEAKER_00: where we led several rounds of funding
[00:09:18] SPEAKER_00: to build AI native software for call centers.
[00:09:20] SPEAKER_00: And we teamed up Andy Lee, who ran a Laura Cut for over 30 years,
[00:09:24] SPEAKER_00: a call center chain with two amazing CTOs, someone
[00:09:27] SPEAKER_00: from GC went and joined full time.
[00:09:29] SPEAKER_00: And we built out this software that automates 50 to 70% now
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_00: of what a call center does.
[00:09:33] SPEAKER_00: So after proving that out in a year
[00:09:36] SPEAKER_00: and having 10 or so pilot clients,
[00:09:37] SPEAKER_00: we gave them the money to actually go buy a call center.
[00:09:40] SPEAKER_00: And they're well on their way now
[00:09:41] SPEAKER_00: of taking 10% EBITDA margins and turning them into 40% EBITDA margins.
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_00: And that's because when half the tasks can be automated,
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_00: people can start to focus on cross-selling,
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_00: revenue opportunities, and the harder tasks.
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_00: So Crescendo is just one example.
[00:09:55] SPEAKER_00: With Long Lake, a second example, they've
[00:09:57] SPEAKER_00: gone after the H.O.A. management space,
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_00: PEO services, and others.
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_00: And they're also scaling quickly, doubling EBITDA margins
[00:10:03] SPEAKER_00: of the companies they've been buying.
[00:10:05] SPEAKER_00: And they've the benefit of having all of the data
[00:10:07] SPEAKER_00: and the ability to do change management and change practices.
[00:10:11] SPEAKER_00: And then, of course, third and fourth,
[00:10:12] SPEAKER_00: we have companies like Titan MSP and the MSP space.
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_00: Then when OutGOT six pilot clients showed us
[00:10:18] SPEAKER_00: they could automate 38% of what MSP does,
[00:10:21] SPEAKER_00: which is a outsource IT services firm.
[00:10:23] SPEAKER_00: And now they've bought RFA, which is a well-known MSP in New York
[00:10:26] SPEAKER_00: and they also are well on their way to doubling EBITDA margins.
[00:10:30] SPEAKER_00: And so we definitely think that there's
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_00: an opportunity for a software.
[00:10:34] SPEAKER_00: But there are a lot of industries that are highly fragmented.
[00:10:36] SPEAKER_00: They're split across the country.
[00:10:38] SPEAKER_00: They don't really buy technology products.
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_00: When they do buy tech products, they call it IT,
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_00: and they cap it at two or three percent of revenue.
[00:10:44] SPEAKER_00: And at the same time, there's this ability with AI
[00:10:47] SPEAKER_00: to go in and automate 20, 30, even 50% of the tasks
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_00: at those businesses.
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_00: So to really make the most out of AI technology,
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_00: you want to buy of these companies and be able to free up
[00:10:58] SPEAKER_00: people to perform the higher earning tasks
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_00: and really grow the company and grow the margin story.
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_00: And that's where we're starting to see proven out across
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_00: all of these case studies and examples.
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_00: And we've been getting a lot of interest from crossover funds
[00:11:10] SPEAKER_00: and others as we've been doing this
[00:11:12] SPEAKER_00: and we've really been proving the model.
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_00: Sorcery is brought to you by Brex,
[00:11:15] SPEAKER_02: the financial stack trusted by more than 30,000 companies,
[00:11:19] SPEAKER_02: including one in three venture back startups in the US.
[00:11:22] SPEAKER_02: Nearly 40% of startups fail because they run out of cash.
[00:11:26] SPEAKER_02: Brex is literally built to help founders avoid that.
[00:11:29] SPEAKER_02: Unlike traditional banks that lay your money set idle,
[00:11:32] SPEAKER_02: shipping away out it with fees,

[00:13:36] SPEAKER_02: Some of you may not have heard this yet,
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_02: but our sponsor public just launched something
[00:13:40] SPEAKER_02: called Generated Assets.
[00:13:42] SPEAKER_02: And it brings AI into investing in a way
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_02: I've honestly never seen before.
[00:13:46] SPEAKER_02: Here's how it works.
[00:13:47] SPEAKER_02: You type in an idea like AI-powered supply chain companies
[00:13:50] SPEAKER_02: with positive free cash flow, or defense tech companies,
[00:13:53] SPEAKER_02: growing revenue over 25% year over year.
[00:13:56] SPEAKER_02: Publix AI then dispatches a swarm of agents
[00:13:59] SPEAKER_02: that scan every single US stock, evaluates them,
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_02: and instantly builds a custom index around your thesis.
[00:14:04] SPEAKER_02: What really stands out is how clearly it explains
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_02: why each stock is included.
[00:14:08] SPEAKER_02: And before you invest, you can even back test your idea
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_02: against the S&P 500.
[00:14:12] SPEAKER_02: So you're making decisions with real context, not just guessing.
[00:14:16] SPEAKER_02: And beyond Generated Assets, public lets you invest
[00:14:18] SPEAKER_02: in stocks, bonds, options, crypto, all in one place.
[00:14:22] SPEAKER_02: They'll even give you an uncapped 1% match
[00:14:24] SPEAKER_02: when you transfer your investments over
[00:14:26] SPEAKER_02: from another platform.
[00:14:27] SPEAKER_02: If you want to build a portfolio that actually reflects
[00:14:29] SPEAKER_02: your thesis, visit public.com slash Sorcery.
[00:14:32] SPEAKER_02: Paid for by public investing, full disclosures
[00:14:35] SPEAKER_02: in the description.
[00:14:36] SPEAKER_02: So these are traditionally not sexy industries at all.
[00:14:41] SPEAKER_02: They're very boring.
[00:14:43] SPEAKER_02: They're boring.
[00:14:44] SPEAKER_02: But you came from a really fun industry.
[00:14:45] SPEAKER_02: You came from crypto and everything.
[00:14:47] SPEAKER_02: And from my understanding and research,
[00:14:49] SPEAKER_02: you looked at 70 different industries
[00:14:51] SPEAKER_02: and you landed on 10 of them for this fund.
[00:14:54] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:14:55] SPEAKER_02: What was your process for that?
[00:14:57] SPEAKER_02: And how did you evaluate the opportunity set
[00:14:59] SPEAKER_02: for those 10 industries?
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_00: Well, I'm still very bullish on crypto
[00:15:02] SPEAKER_00: and got into space in 2016.
[00:15:05] SPEAKER_00: It was an early investor in amazing companies.
[00:15:08] SPEAKER_00: Started to go me with Jen and Greg.
[00:15:09] SPEAKER_00: We built it, sold it to Coinbase.
[00:15:11] SPEAKER_00: Today, it's the hard to Coinbase Prime.
[00:15:13] SPEAKER_00: Wish Greg to start my co-founder still runs.
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_00: And after the Coinbase exit, I found myself doing a lot
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_00: of angel investing.
[00:15:20] SPEAKER_00: A lot of it in great FinTech companies, like RAMP and Zip
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_00: and others.
[00:15:24] SPEAKER_00: But I was also looking at NFTs and other things, honestly,
[00:15:27] SPEAKER_00: and crypto that didn't really play out.
[00:15:29] SPEAKER_00: And at the same time, I started meeting
[00:15:31] SPEAKER_00: these really smart AI founders.
[00:15:32] SPEAKER_00: And I felt like if I was giving money
[00:15:34] SPEAKER_00: to people putting monkeys on the internet,
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_00: probably I should support these like PhDs and AI
[00:15:39] SPEAKER_00: from Stanford who are working really hard
[00:15:41] SPEAKER_00: on their companies and play it forward.
[00:15:43] SPEAKER_00: So I got to be in the angel round of Harvey and together
[00:15:45] SPEAKER_00: and Windsor from a lot of these names.
[00:15:47] SPEAKER_00: And so seeing their progress was really what inspired me
[00:15:50] SPEAKER_00: then a general catalyst to say, I still
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_00: want to invest in crypto, which is obviously growing really
[00:15:55] SPEAKER_00: well in terms of Bitcoin and stable coin adoption
[00:15:59] SPEAKER_00: and things being built on Ethereum.
[00:16:01] But I also want to be part of this AI movement.
[00:16:03] SPEAKER_00: And then as I started to think about how
[00:16:05] SPEAKER_00: do I want to be part of this AI transformation,
[00:16:07] SPEAKER_00: I started talking to a lot of second-time founders
[00:16:09] SPEAKER_00: like myself.
[00:16:10] SPEAKER_00: And most of them were identifying that the hard part
[00:16:12] SPEAKER_00: was go to market.
[00:16:13] SPEAKER_00: I can build AI software to automate a lot of what a call
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_00: center does, or a lot of what a law firm does,
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_00: or an accounting firm, or an IT firm.
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_00: But it's going to be really, or H.O.A. management
[00:16:23] SPEAKER_00: or property management, like with Dwelly out in the UK.
[00:16:25] SPEAKER_00: But it's going to be really hard for me to go to market
[00:16:27] SPEAKER_00: in these unsexy industries where I don't have a network,
[00:16:30] SPEAKER_00: where it's really fragmented, where they don't really
[00:16:32] SPEAKER_00: trust tech.
[00:16:33] SPEAKER_00: It's not the same as a ramp or brick
[00:16:35] SPEAKER_00: selling into all the hot startups.
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_00: And so it was really brainstorming
[00:16:39] SPEAKER_00: with those second-time founders, thinking about,
[00:16:40] SPEAKER_00: how do we take this AI technology and really scale and grow?
[00:16:44] SPEAKER_00: That we together really conceived of this AI role of concept
[00:16:47] SPEAKER_00: very early on, with especially folks like Long Lake
[00:16:50] SPEAKER_00: being a great example, or a crescendo.
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_00: Those were really two of the first in this space,
[00:16:54] SPEAKER_00: and got very lucky to work with them.
[00:16:56] SPEAKER_00: As we started seeing their success,
[00:16:57] SPEAKER_00: we stepped back and said, we should help down here.
[00:16:59] SPEAKER_00: We also were obviously getting a ton of interest
[00:17:01] SPEAKER_00: from other investors, and LPs, and others.
[00:17:04] SPEAKER_00: And so that's when we became more systematic.
[00:17:06] SPEAKER_00: About a year and a half, two years ago, where we said,
[00:17:08] SPEAKER_00: OK, we have these success stories.
[00:17:10] SPEAKER_00: Maybe there a bit more one off.
[00:17:11] SPEAKER_00: It was about these amazing founders we want to back
[00:17:13] SPEAKER_00: in about applied AI.
[00:17:15] SPEAKER_00: But let's actually look at 70 services based industries.
[00:17:18] SPEAKER_00: And let's try to figure out which of those 70s
[00:17:20] SPEAKER_00: we could automate 30% of the tasks happening there.
[00:17:23] SPEAKER_00: And we were able to kind of figure that out by first saying,
[00:17:26] SPEAKER_00: well, what can AI automate?
[00:17:27] SPEAKER_00: Like, what's it good at?
[00:17:28] SPEAKER_00: And they were four pretty clear buckets.
[00:17:30] SPEAKER_00: One was customer success and support and service.
[00:17:33] SPEAKER_00: Basically, AI agents can do that task pretty well.
[00:17:36] SPEAKER_00: A second was a data entry and evaluation.
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_00: If you're filling out the same forms,
[00:17:40] SPEAKER_00: you're adding the same tables, that was a second bucket.
[00:17:42] SPEAKER_00: It really could do well.
[00:17:43] SPEAKER_00: A third was creating content and copy and marketing
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_00: so like an FAQ or an investor presentation
[00:17:49] SPEAKER_00: or a list of dues and do nots.
[00:17:51] SPEAKER_00: Like, that sort of content was really good at.
[00:17:53] SPEAKER_00: Or responding to email or doing translation
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_00: or creating an NDA contract.
[00:17:57] SPEAKER_00: And then a fourth bucket, which has only happened last nine months,
[00:18:00] SPEAKER_00: is basic logic and reasoning,
[00:18:02] SPEAKER_00: including like an insurance, should I underwrite this person?
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_00: There are super risky driver.
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_00: Here's their background.
[00:18:07] SPEAKER_00: It's not so clear.
[00:18:09] SPEAKER_00: But you can do almost as good job as a human saying,
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_00: yeah, you hear the risks, hear the rewards.
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_00: Here's my recommendation.
[00:18:14] SPEAKER_00: So this fourth bucket of kind of basic logic and reasoning,
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_00: which has really been pushed forward
[00:18:19] SPEAKER_00: by all the automation and things like code and other areas
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_00: where the four buckets we identified.
[00:18:24] SPEAKER_00: So then we mapped those forms of automation
[00:18:26] SPEAKER_00: against these 70 industries.
[00:18:28] SPEAKER_00: And we came up with 10 where we thought we have really high conviction
[00:18:31] SPEAKER_00: that at least 20% or 30% of tasks, again, not people,
[00:18:34] SPEAKER_00: but tasks can be automated.
[00:18:36] SPEAKER_00: And then if you work at H.O.A. Management Company
[00:18:38] SPEAKER_00: or if you work at a call center, if you work in legal,
[00:18:41] SPEAKER_00: with 30% free time you have, we now ask you to do more work.
[00:18:44] SPEAKER_00: Like take on more clients, cross-sell them, do harder tasks.
[00:18:47] SPEAKER_00: And so with the same cost basis,
[00:18:50] SPEAKER_00: but adding all these AI tools for automation
[00:18:52] SPEAKER_00: and these four buckets, folks can now take on 2050
[00:18:55] SPEAKER_00: and over three or four years, even 100% more tasks
[00:18:59] SPEAKER_00: with the same cost basis.
[00:19:00] SPEAKER_00: So we're already seeing in many of the case studies
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_00: that if you look at the first couple companies they acquired,
[00:19:06] SPEAKER_00: even if they've only grown revenue 20%,
[00:19:08] SPEAKER_00: if they've kept the cost basis flat using AI,
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_00: but then bringing up people to kind of do 20% more tasks,
[00:19:14] SPEAKER_00: around 10 or 15% EBITDA margin businesses
[00:19:17] SPEAKER_00: can become 30% EBITDA margin businesses.
[00:19:19] SPEAKER_00: You can roughly double the free cash flow.
[00:19:21] SPEAKER_00: And we're seeing that happen in many of our businesses
[00:19:23] SPEAKER_00: in a one year period.
[00:19:24] SPEAKER_00: So for us, so at the heart of that is the AI automation enough.
[00:19:28] SPEAKER_00: And obviously we decided not to go forward
[00:19:30] SPEAKER_00: to the 60 of the 70s.
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_00: So we held a really high bar to,
[00:19:33] SPEAKER_00: is this an industry where AI automation
[00:19:35] SPEAKER_00: actually can make a meaningful difference?
[00:19:37] SPEAKER_00: Then can we actually go and buy and roll up these companies,
[00:19:40] SPEAKER_00: get their data, improve the models, improve our software,
[00:19:44] SPEAKER_00: automate 20 plus percent of tasks,
[00:19:46] SPEAKER_00: free people up at a cross-sell, get more revenue,
[00:19:49] SPEAKER_00: and the result is a higher revenue base
[00:19:51] SPEAKER_00: with a very similar cost basis,
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_00: which generally translates to a really large improvement
[00:19:56] SPEAKER_00: in EBITDA margin.
[00:19:57] SPEAKER_00: This market, some could estimate is between 20 to 30 trillion dollars.
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_02: How do you view this type of private company
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_02: in the grand scheme of knowledge work?
[00:20:11] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we have a slightly more conservative sort of 16 trillion.
[00:20:15] SPEAKER_00: We think services industry is globally,
[00:20:17] SPEAKER_00: which is really massive to your point.
[00:20:19] SPEAKER_00: And on the software side, software globally
[00:20:21] SPEAKER_00: is like a one trillion opportunity.
[00:20:23] SPEAKER_00: So it is 16 times larger.
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_00: Well, why hasn't everyone in VC rushed to invest in services businesses,
[00:20:28] SPEAKER_00: like accounting, legal, IT, insurance?
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_00: Well, they historically have not been that profitable.
[00:20:34] SPEAKER_00: So they sort of break even generally in many cases.
[00:20:37] SPEAKER_00: Well, obviously, as you get to scale in that one trillion of revenue and software,
[00:20:41] SPEAKER_00: the marginal cost is really low and they can become very profitable
[00:20:44] SPEAKER_00: and have amazing cash flow and companies like CrowdStrike or ServiceNow
[00:20:47] SPEAKER_00: or others kind of show this model.
[00:20:50] SPEAKER_00: And of course, the hyperscalers like Amazon and Google and Microsoft.
[00:20:53] SPEAKER_00: So there are all these amazing proven examples in the software field
[00:20:56] SPEAKER_00: of having very strong free cash flow and on high margins.
[00:21:00] SPEAKER_00: Arthesis somewhat is, well, these unsexy services industries
[00:21:03] SPEAKER_00: that were break even or 15 to 20% EBITDA margins, net income,
[00:21:07] SPEAKER_00: obviously much lower, they can look like software from a margin profile.
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_00: Because once you take out the repetitive tasks
[00:21:14] SPEAKER_00: and you take out 30, 40, 50% of what people do
[00:21:16] SPEAKER_00: and free them up to do the hard stuff with the same cost basis,
[00:21:20] SPEAKER_00: you can 50% grow the revenue or double the revenue,
[00:21:23] SPEAKER_00: your margin profile now looks much, much more similar to software.
[00:21:26] SPEAKER_00: So we think in this much larger time than software,
[00:21:29] SPEAKER_00: you can have software like margins.
[00:21:31] SPEAKER_00: And that's only happening now because of AI,
[00:21:34] SPEAKER_00: both in the form of LLMs and basically creating software to automate tasks,
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_00: but also in the form of AI agents that can actually handle from soup to nuts task.
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_00: So we think there'll be a mix of kind of AI native software,
[00:21:47] SPEAKER_00: agentech workforces, people working for agents,
[00:21:50] SPEAKER_00: agents working for people kind of mixing all of that up,
[00:21:53] SPEAKER_00: a totally different margin profile for some of these companies.
[00:21:56] SPEAKER_00: I'm so curious how you assemble the team to do this,
[00:22:00] SPEAKER_02: because it's fairly novel.
[00:22:02] SPEAKER_02: I mean, you're doing it within a traditionally venture capital fund,
[00:22:06] SPEAKER_02: but you're bringing in traditional private equity into it as well.
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_02: So and also tech, like you need operations.
[00:22:12] SPEAKER_02: So how did you assemble the team and what's the composition?
[00:22:15] Yeah, so the creation strategy at GC has really existed since the beginning.
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_00: So we've really focused on backing sectum founders and operators and stories like kayak
[00:22:25] SPEAKER_00: and Lavango were built out of our offices.
[00:22:27] SPEAKER_00: And so we've had this sort of incubation muscle for a long time at GC.
[00:22:31] SPEAKER_00: In 2021, we formalized it a little more and had a dedicated sleeve around it
[00:22:36] SPEAKER_00: and said, we're going to commit this much capital.
[00:22:37] SPEAKER_00: And then we obviously double that and grew it last year as well.
[00:22:41] SPEAKER_00: But the mantra GC of how do we get amazing ideas
[00:22:44] SPEAKER_00: and co-founders, put them together, build companies, leverage our network?
[00:22:48] SPEAKER_00: Many times it's multi-disciplinary, like ones in healthcare, one in technology.
[00:22:52] SPEAKER_00: That's been for a long time.
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_00: So we are building off of a great foundation at GC.
[00:22:57] SPEAKER_00: But we've really changed it now where we're also adding in a lot of the apply day
[00:23:00] SPEAKER_00: I peace.
[00:23:01] SPEAKER_00: And so at our heart, we kind of have three things.
[00:23:03] SPEAKER_00: One, we definitely won second time founders like myself for Haman,
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_00: who built out Lavango or others,
[00:23:08] SPEAKER_00: folks on the team like Chris Kaufman had operational roles.
[00:23:11] SPEAKER_00: It kind of was an interim CFO at a Rugg company marketplace.
[00:23:14] SPEAKER_00: So we definitely won people who have founder or operating roles.
[00:23:18] SPEAKER_00: Then we also won people who have some VC or angel investing experience.
[00:23:22] SPEAKER_00: And lastly, we've been mixing it in with people who have private equity experience.
[00:23:25] SPEAKER_00: And I started my career in McKinsey and then worked in private equity.
[00:23:29] SPEAKER_00: So I have a lot of folks on our team like Kate, Chris, Sarah, Mark Crain.
[00:23:32] SPEAKER_00: And so we are looking for kind of this.
[00:23:35] SPEAKER_00: Maybe it's a bit more difficult to hire for,
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_00: for people who have the PE experience, operational experience, and VC experience.
[00:23:41] SPEAKER_00: And we've kind of connected this Motley crew.
[00:23:44] SPEAKER_00: And now it's been really helpful to us as really our founders selling us.
[00:23:48] SPEAKER_00: And so we've made about nine offers in this AI enabled software rollup idea,
[00:23:52] SPEAKER_00: or AI enabled software that turns into rollups.
[00:23:54] SPEAKER_00: We've kind of made nine offers and we've won eight out of the nine.
[00:23:58] SPEAKER_00: And so GC has certainly created a brand around.
[00:24:01] SPEAKER_00: If this is a strategy that reds resonates with you and you're a founder,
[00:24:04] SPEAKER_00: there are a lot of ways we can help you in terms of setting up the team, looking at targets,
[00:24:08] SPEAKER_00: looking at industries together, thinking about how you should be using debt funding,
[00:24:13] SPEAKER_00: thinking about the CVF makes sense for your business.
[00:24:15] SPEAKER_00: So we have really created a flywheel and playbook around this
[00:24:18] SPEAKER_00: that what I'm most proud of is how it's resonated with founders.
[00:24:21] SPEAKER_00: We're clearly the top choice in this space.
[00:24:23] SPEAKER_00: That's so fascinating.
[00:24:24] SPEAKER_02: Can you talk through the funding mechanism part of it?
[00:24:26] SPEAKER_02: Like how do you structure it?
[00:24:28] Yeah, so we normally do one or two rounds to build the software piece.
[00:24:32] SPEAKER_00: Like with the Titan MSP, for example,
[00:24:34] SPEAKER_00: we gave them kind of a traditional seed series A to build out AI automation
[00:24:39] SPEAKER_00: for IT services for MSPs.
[00:24:41] SPEAKER_00: And they went out and they got six pilot clients in over three or four months.
[00:24:44] SPEAKER_00: They sort of showed us, hey, look at all the tickets that happen in MSP.
[00:24:48] SPEAKER_00: We can now automate 38% of them.
[00:24:50] SPEAKER_00: So when that happens, then we start talking to them about a second round of funding.
[00:24:53] SPEAKER_00: We say, well, let's actually go look for targets.
[00:24:56] SPEAKER_00: Because if we can buy one of these companies and automate 38%,
[00:24:59] SPEAKER_00: we're certainly going to increase the margin and be able to reinvest a lot of that free cashflow
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_00: into growth and create a really successful company.
[00:25:06] SPEAKER_00: And so we look at, especially the pilot clients that they're working with
[00:25:10] SPEAKER_00: and who really wants to say, I technology, and unlike private equity,
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_00: we screen really hard for does this company want to change?
[00:25:17] SPEAKER_00: Do they want to implement AI?
[00:25:19] SPEAKER_00: And then of course, we want to hold them for seven to 10 years and go public
[00:25:22] SPEAKER_00: and not necessarily at debt and cost.
[00:25:23] SPEAKER_00: It's a really different model than private equity.
[00:25:26] SPEAKER_00: But in their case, then we gave them a second round of funding
[00:25:28] SPEAKER_00: when they found their target, RFA.
[00:25:30] SPEAKER_00: And now that they've found that target and are doing really well
[00:25:33] SPEAKER_00: in the AI transformation, then they say, OK, now we want a third round of funding
[00:25:36] SPEAKER_00: to go and do a lot of small tuck-ins or buy another platform.
[00:25:40] SPEAKER_00: So at GC, we've been investing between 100 and 150 million in each of these projects.
[00:25:45] SPEAKER_00: But over three or four rounds of funding, we like to lead at least the first two.
[00:25:49] SPEAKER_00: And then we start bringing in other investors and the third or the fourth.
[00:25:52] SPEAKER_00: And we get to work with some really great cross-over funds,
[00:25:55] SPEAKER_00: other VCs as well on these projects, some like ELADI,
[00:25:58] SPEAKER_00: you've had on the podcast, this great collaborator of ours and others.
[00:26:01] SPEAKER_00: So we've definitely been seeing kind of a lot of success with that.
[00:26:05] SPEAKER_00: You said you plan on holding these for seven to 10 years
[00:26:09] SPEAKER_02: and hopefully go public, that sort of thing, some sort of exit scenario.
[00:26:15] SPEAKER_02: That's a little bit different than the fast shirt
[00:26:17] SPEAKER_02: around of a traditional private equity fund
[00:26:20] SPEAKER_02: and everything that goes on with that.
[00:26:22] SPEAKER_02: Call it bad.
[00:26:24] SPEAKER_02: But I'm curious around that philosophy,
[00:26:28] SPEAKER_02: like why hold it for that long?
[00:26:31] Yeah, a lot of it is because we want these to be compounders.
[00:26:33] SPEAKER_00: So the end of vision for most of the founders is,
[00:26:36] SPEAKER_00: I want to be the next generation trans-dime
[00:26:39] SPEAKER_00: or Dan or her constellation software.
[00:26:41] SPEAKER_00: There are these companies in the public markets,
[00:26:43] SPEAKER_00: with over 100 billion market cap that have outperformed NASDAQ, outperformed S&P.
[00:26:48] SPEAKER_00: And what they do is they go buy companies, improve their operations,
[00:26:52] SPEAKER_00: generate more free cash flow from the company they bought.
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_00: And with that extra free cash flow, they go and they buy even more companies
[00:26:57] SPEAKER_00: and they wash and repeat.
[00:26:59] SPEAKER_00: And so they've been termed by public investors as compounders.
[00:27:02] SPEAKER_00: And they've done really well.
[00:27:03] SPEAKER_00: It's a great model.
[00:27:04] SPEAKER_00: Our view is that they're going to be these AI native compounders.
[00:27:08] SPEAKER_00: That they go buy companies, they improve them,
[00:27:10] SPEAKER_00: they generate more free cash flow, then they reinvest that to continue to grow quickly.
[00:27:15] SPEAKER_00: But the driving improvement is more AI.
[00:27:18] SPEAKER_00: So historically, it's been things like pricing or sourcing materials better
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_00: or maybe improvement on some of the go-to-market.
[00:27:24] SPEAKER_00: Here, a lot of the improvement is on this AI automation piece.
[00:27:28] SPEAKER_00: And so we think there'll be plenty of these $100 billion AI native compounders
[00:27:32] SPEAKER_00: in the public markets 10 years from now.
[00:27:34] SPEAKER_00: And the founders who are starting these companies generally have very strong tech backgrounds.
[00:27:38] SPEAKER_00: And they want to build a business that's VC-back.
[00:27:40] SPEAKER_00: They want to take a public.
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_00: And many of them want to run it in the public market for 10 years.
[00:27:44] SPEAKER_00: So they really want ownership on this for the next 20 years.
[00:27:47] SPEAKER_00: Very different than private equity, where there's a management team that works
[00:27:50] SPEAKER_00: for a private equity firm that's highly incentiveized to get this company
[00:27:54] SPEAKER_00: to be sold in three to five years, maybe to another PE,
[00:27:57] SPEAKER_00: maybe to a strategic.
[00:27:59] SPEAKER_00: And so the focus is adding debt, cutting costs, improving margin that way.
[00:28:03] SPEAKER_00: And it's not really an investing in technology for the long run.
[00:28:06] SPEAKER_00: Some of this AI technology you add costs, right?
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_00: So you can't go in add debt, cut costs.
[00:28:11] SPEAKER_00: We're actually going in and we're adding costs.
[00:28:13] SPEAKER_00: We're saying higher engineers, we're subscribing to LLM-based software.
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_00: We're going in and investing in adding costs.
[00:28:19] SPEAKER_00: But we think it's worth it because we're adding a lot less cost
[00:28:22] SPEAKER_00: than the amount of revenue we're adding, as we're freeing up people
[00:28:24] SPEAKER_00: to do more and more revenue-producing tasks.
[00:28:26] SPEAKER_00: So our mindset is longer term and the founders who actually own these companies,
[00:28:30] SPEAKER_00: majority owners, their mindset is longer term.
[00:28:33] SPEAKER_00: So it's just a different strategy.
[00:28:35] SPEAKER_00: PE has obviously done really well.
[00:28:36] SPEAKER_00: There are a lot of efficiencies in many markets.
[00:28:39] SPEAKER_00: There's also not enough automation in many markets to do what the strategy we are.
[00:28:43] SPEAKER_00: So we have a lot of respect for private equity and the work folks like Tom O'Bravo
[00:28:47] SPEAKER_00: and Blackstone and others have done.
[00:28:49] SPEAKER_00: They've been incredibly successful.
[00:28:50] SPEAKER_00: We're kind of playing our own game around, hey, how do we help these founders
[00:28:54] SPEAKER_00: get AI-native compounders?
[00:28:55] SPEAKER_00: They'll be in the public market with a much longer term view and a view
[00:28:59] SPEAKER_00: that we should take these companies and go public.
[00:29:01] SPEAKER_00: And maybe even GC holds the stock after they go public and keeps compounding.
[00:29:05] SPEAKER_00: So efficiencies, synergies, change management, all the good buzzwords.
[00:29:10] SPEAKER_02: Exactly. We pull some of those and then leave others out.
[00:29:13] SPEAKER_00: Like on the change management side, we tend to really screen for the right founders.
[00:29:17] SPEAKER_00: So our view is when our founders create these whole co's and then want to buy companies,
[00:29:21] SPEAKER_00: they generally don't do the change management part.
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_00: We just screen really hard for people who want AI change in the businesses from the get co.
[00:29:28] SPEAKER_00: This is something I've noticed and I mean, there's data around it too,
[00:29:31] SPEAKER_02: but the private markets are swelling.
[00:29:33] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:29:34] SPEAKER_02: And it extends from private equity to private credit.
[00:29:37] SPEAKER_02: I mean, this I think would be part of it.
[00:29:39] SPEAKER_02: It's a new pool.
[00:29:40] SPEAKER_02: Carta has seen this as well and they've extended their products into private credit,
[00:29:44] SPEAKER_02: private equity.
[00:29:46] SPEAKER_02: They're now doing LP management.
[00:29:49] SPEAKER_02: How do you think those markets have actually changed operationally with AI,
[00:29:56] SPEAKER_02: with what's going on, with competition?
[00:29:59] SPEAKER_02: Even when you're looking at buying companies for some of these,
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_02: is there competition between, like, how does that work?
[00:30:05] SPEAKER_02: We haven't seen a lot of people implement AI effectively to date.
[00:30:09] SPEAKER_00: And we're generally in the view, along with that MIT study,
[00:30:12] SPEAKER_00: that maybe 95% of these Fortune 100s have tried and they said it's kind of a waste
[00:30:17] SPEAKER_00: and it didn't really work.
[00:30:17] SPEAKER_00: And it was janky and that kind of stuff.
[00:30:20] SPEAKER_00: So we are of a view that it is really hard to actually turn AI native.
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_00: And so our worldview is let's create an AI native team.
[00:30:29] SPEAKER_00: Maybe they were ahead of applied AI at Rippling or Scale or Stripe.
[00:30:34] SPEAKER_00: Or they worked at these places or Figma.
[00:30:35] SPEAKER_00: And they've really seen AI applied within the enterprise setting.
[00:30:39] SPEAKER_00: Let's put together these teams.
[00:30:41] SPEAKER_00: Let's incubate AI native teams, AI native software.
[00:30:43] SPEAKER_00: And then let's go out and buy these companies.
[00:30:45] SPEAKER_00: Because we've found when traditional companies are trying to implement AI,
[00:30:49] SPEAKER_00: they get some benefits for sure.
[00:30:51] SPEAKER_00: But there's a lot left to be desired, basically,
[00:30:54] SPEAKER_00: in terms of the amount of automation they can achieve.
[00:30:57] SPEAKER_00: So at least for us, we think that it's pretty difficult to just take models
[00:31:00] SPEAKER_00: out of the box and implement them.
[00:31:02] SPEAKER_00: You need a lot of context, you know, you need a native team.
[00:31:05] SPEAKER_00: You need a team that knows how to build software around the models.
[00:31:08] SPEAKER_00: All of that is kind of difficult, which model to use.
[00:31:11] SPEAKER_00: And so we kind of agree with the MIT study that says, yeah, AI is kind of a buzzword
[00:31:15] SPEAKER_00: that's hard to implement right now.
[00:31:17] SPEAKER_00: And we don't necessarily think that the world is going straight to AGI
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_00: where AI agents will immediately be able to do everything.
[00:31:23] SPEAKER_00: So I think we said, at least in the creation strategy, somewhere in the middle,
[00:31:27] SPEAKER_00: where if you have an AI native team,
[00:31:29] SPEAKER_00: but you also have the traditional clients, customer base, services folks,
[00:31:34] SPEAKER_00: and you mix it together, that's where you can have kind of the best outcome.
[00:31:37] SPEAKER_00: The best revenue growth, the best margin profile.
[00:31:40] SPEAKER_00: So we really believe in this hybrid approach,
[00:31:42] SPEAKER_00: where AI in the right hands will be able to automate
[00:31:45] SPEAKER_00: a good deal of work in many industries,
[00:31:47] SPEAKER_00: but you'll also need people for tasks.
[00:31:49] SPEAKER_00: And kind of this mix of people, software, agents,
[00:31:53] SPEAKER_00: it's going to be unique to each industry.
[00:31:55] SPEAKER_00: And we can create the category defining company in each industry
[00:31:58] SPEAKER_00: to go after that opportunity with the full tool set in the toolkit.
[00:32:02] I recently had Michael Barton, who's a sector head at Cotu on the podcast.
[00:32:06] SPEAKER_02: And he framed this out as there's two camps.
[00:32:10] SPEAKER_02: There's AI will drive, and this has to do with layoffs.
[00:32:14] SPEAKER_02: AI will drive efficiencies for teams, and teams will be smaller.
[00:32:19] SPEAKER_02: Then there's another camp that says,
[00:32:21] SPEAKER_02: no, this will make your teams much more powerful,
[00:32:24] SPEAKER_02: and you'll be able to build bigger teams that are just much more effective.
[00:32:28] SPEAKER_02: Where do you sit between these two camps?
[00:32:30] SPEAKER_02: We're pretty squarely in the second camp.
[00:32:33] SPEAKER_00: I'll give you an example, but we incubated a company, Hippocratic AI,
[00:32:36] SPEAKER_00: which is an AI nurse, say AI nurse software.
[00:32:39] SPEAKER_00: And you know, there's just such a massive shortage of nurses in this country.
[00:32:43] SPEAKER_00: And in the hospital systems.
[00:32:44] SPEAKER_00: And so our view is AI is not coming into replace nurses,
[00:32:48] SPEAKER_00: but now one nurse could manage a team of five AI's
[00:32:51] SPEAKER_00: that can do a lot of the basic tasks, like checking in on a patient
[00:32:54] SPEAKER_00: or getting information.
[00:32:55] SPEAKER_00: So for us, we kind of think the AI will create a lot of volume in the economy.
[00:33:00] SPEAKER_00: There'll be a lot more new jobs.
[00:33:02] SPEAKER_00: And so every time this happens in technology,
[00:33:04] SPEAKER_00: it's the internet coming in and replacing jobs,
[00:33:06] SPEAKER_00: or as local motives coming in and replacing jobs.
[00:33:08] SPEAKER_00: The truth is, it's very granular.
[00:33:10] SPEAKER_00: Sadly, yes, some jobs might not be there anymore.
[00:33:13] SPEAKER_00: But at the same time, it's creating a lot of economic opportunity
[00:33:16] SPEAKER_00: and new types of jobs, or even letting one person now do a lot more work.
[00:33:20] SPEAKER_00: So that's what we see the most in the services industry.
[00:33:23] SPEAKER_00: Is if someone can now do three times the amount of work
[00:33:25] SPEAKER_00: because they have orchestrated AI agents and they use LLM software,
[00:33:29] SPEAKER_00: are you getting rid of someone who's now three times as efficient
[00:33:31] SPEAKER_00: who only needs a slight salary increase?
[00:33:34] SPEAKER_00: You're probably not.
[00:33:35] SPEAKER_00: You probably are hiring three or four more of them.
[00:33:37] SPEAKER_00: And so that's kind of what we see on the ground,
[00:33:39] SPEAKER_00: which is in many of these spaces,
[00:33:41] SPEAKER_00: there's a huge shortage of nurses, accountants,
[00:33:43] SPEAKER_00: and yes, even lawyers, it'd be nice if everyone could have a lawyer
[00:33:46] SPEAKER_00: in their phone, right?
[00:33:47] SPEAKER_00: So many of these industries, more and more people would love to have it.
[00:33:50] SPEAKER_00: We believe in this idea of abundance.
[00:33:52] SPEAKER_00: And abundance is going to come from that mix of people and AI services.
[00:33:57] SPEAKER_00: It won't be purely AI.
[00:33:59] SPEAKER_00: It won't necessarily be purely replacing people.
[00:34:01] SPEAKER_00: We do think that there'll be a transition part,
[00:34:04] SPEAKER_00: but there's some happy medium.
[00:34:05] SPEAKER_00: And then the second nuance is kind of the first things to go
[00:34:08] SPEAKER_00: is a lot of the outsourcing businesses.
[00:34:10] SPEAKER_00: So there's a lot of outsourcing in legal.
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_00: There was a lot of outsourcing in call centers.
[00:34:14] SPEAKER_00: There's a lot of outsourcing and insurance,
[00:34:16] SPEAKER_00: like looking over claims.
[00:34:18] SPEAKER_00: But what we're seeing a lot of is you add AI technology
[00:34:20] SPEAKER_00: to American companies.
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_00: They're now much more efficient.
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_00: They don't need to outsource a lot of these more repetitive tasks.
[00:34:26] SPEAKER_00: So I think the area that will be hit the hardest
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_00: is probably abroad in places like India, Philippines,
[00:34:31] SPEAKER_00: places like that, even Mexico.
[00:34:34] SPEAKER_00: So here at GC, we are committed to trying to figure out ways
[00:34:36] SPEAKER_00: to how do you retrain and reskill?
[00:34:38] SPEAKER_00: And can we invest in companies?
[00:34:40] SPEAKER_00: There are training people in new fields.
[00:34:42] SPEAKER_00: And we think it'll be most felt actually outside of the United States.
[00:34:47] After surveying all these different shifts
[00:34:50] SPEAKER_02: and this transition period that you talk about,
[00:34:54] I think there's definitely going to be one, too.
[00:34:56] SPEAKER_02: You don't know the future of jobs will be.
[00:34:59] SPEAKER_02: Calche had a market that it hit up to 86%.
[00:35:03] SPEAKER_02: I haven't checked it recently on layoffs and tech.
[00:35:06] SPEAKER_02: And there's going to be an 86% chance
[00:35:10] SPEAKER_02: that there's going to be more layoffs this year than in 2024.
[00:35:14] SPEAKER_02: But I do think, I don't know if that one's true or not.
[00:35:16] SPEAKER_02: So you'd have to check the data.
[00:35:18] SPEAKER_02: But you would think that because of all this mix,
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_02: new industries might pop up.
[00:35:25] SPEAKER_02: What are you thinking might, like, what could come next?
[00:35:29] Yeah, I think it'll be a lot more of things
[00:35:31] SPEAKER_00: that right now are really limited to people with resources.
[00:35:34] SPEAKER_00: So I think there'll be a lot more legal use cases
[00:35:37] SPEAKER_00: and way more representation and legal,
[00:35:39] SPEAKER_00: I think like a real time understanding
[00:35:41] SPEAKER_00: of your company, your balance sheets, accounting,
[00:35:44] SPEAKER_00: it'll be a lot more there.
[00:35:45] SPEAKER_00: So I think there'll be industries that already exist,
[00:35:47] SPEAKER_00: but much more abundance on the nursing side right now
[00:35:50] SPEAKER_00: if you're dispatched from a hospital,
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_00: maybe they follow up with you for three months or six months,
[00:35:54] SPEAKER_00: but it just doesn't make economic sense
[00:35:56] SPEAKER_00: to follow up with patients nine months a year out.
[00:35:58] SPEAKER_00: But if you were truly doing the best thing for your patient,
[00:36:00] SPEAKER_00: you would follow up with them in nine months
[00:36:03] SPEAKER_00: and in 12 months.
[00:36:04] SPEAKER_00: So I think a lot of these industries,
[00:36:06] SPEAKER_00: like healthcare, insurance, legal,
[00:36:08] SPEAKER_00: where people have resources but then are tapped out,
[00:36:11] SPEAKER_00: there'll be just a lot more around that.
[00:36:13] SPEAKER_00: And so I think you'll have way more sophisticated markets
[00:36:15] SPEAKER_00: in all of these places.
[00:36:17] So to be as imbiocates as possible and objective,
[00:36:20] SPEAKER_02: do you think AI roll-ups are underrated or overrated?
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_02: I think they're underrated right now.
[00:36:26] SPEAKER_00: I mean, most people you talk to
[00:36:28] SPEAKER_00: don't haven't really heard of them.
[00:36:30] SPEAKER_00: So we're just getting started on this part.
[00:36:32] SPEAKER_00: I think right now people think,
[00:36:34] SPEAKER_00: oh, it's a way to maybe put more money to work or something,
[00:36:37] SPEAKER_00: because obviously as you buy companies,
[00:36:38] SPEAKER_00: you can move quickly, you can put more money to work.
[00:36:41] SPEAKER_00: But I think folks don't fundamentally understand
[00:36:43] SPEAKER_00: that in a $16 trillion services industry,
[00:36:47] SPEAKER_00: we could have companies growing faster
[00:36:49] SPEAKER_00: than software companies and at higher margin
[00:36:51] SPEAKER_00: than software companies.
[00:36:52] SPEAKER_00: And so this pool of $1 trillion that VC has been fishing in
[00:36:56] SPEAKER_00: has actually expanded now,
[00:36:58] SPEAKER_00: maybe not to the full $16 trillion,
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_00: but to multiple trillion.
[00:37:01] SPEAKER_00: I think very few folks really grasp that.
[00:37:05] SPEAKER_00: And so I definitely think that for now they're underrated.
[00:37:08] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I brought that up because I'm just like thinking
[00:37:10] SPEAKER_02: about all the numbers that you've been mentioning
[00:37:11] SPEAKER_02: throughout this and like increasing EBITDA
[00:37:14] SPEAKER_02: and the growth and the CAD count, all of it.
[00:37:16] It seems a much more lucrative
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_02: and so I'm happy that we're diving deep into it.
[00:37:21] SPEAKER_02: So when we look at this industry and like the different players
[00:37:24] SPEAKER_02: that go into it, how much of a role do consulting services
[00:37:30] SPEAKER_02: play in this and what do you think happens to the McKinsey
[00:37:34] SPEAKER_02: where you used to work or like Accenture
[00:37:37] SPEAKER_02: and how effective are they in this process?
[00:37:39] SPEAKER_02: Cause it's really difficult.
[00:37:41] SPEAKER_02: Totally, our view is, you know,
[00:37:43] SPEAKER_00: at least on the AI rollup side,
[00:37:44] SPEAKER_00: we're more getting these smaller fragmented style businesses
[00:37:48] SPEAKER_00: and putting them together and doing this AI transformation.
[00:37:51] SPEAKER_00: McKinsey and Accenture's and others
[00:37:53] SPEAKER_00: really focus more on the Fortune 100.
[00:37:55] SPEAKER_00: And I think they'll have some success in embedding AI there.
[00:37:58] SPEAKER_00: But at GC, we created a company called Percept of
[00:38:01] SPEAKER_00: one of our transformation companies
[00:38:03] SPEAKER_00: that we want to hold for the long term.
[00:38:05] SPEAKER_00: And they, you know, the thesis there is that
[00:38:07] SPEAKER_00: maybe traditional consulting isn't really designed
[00:38:10] SPEAKER_00: for a lot of the AI implementation piece.
[00:38:12] SPEAKER_00: So they can give more strategy advice,
[00:38:14] SPEAKER_00: but not necessarily the same kind of,
[00:38:16] SPEAKER_00: hey, here's what we're seeing.
[00:38:17] SPEAKER_00: It's a fast moving industry.
[00:38:19] SPEAKER_00: Here are the companies we've invested in.
[00:38:21] SPEAKER_00: Let's actually go and implement
[00:38:22] SPEAKER_00: kind of fast moving AI changing technology
[00:38:24] SPEAKER_00: in the Fortune 100.
[00:38:26] SPEAKER_00: So I do think there's a huge opportunity
[00:38:27] SPEAKER_00: for companies like Percept,
[00:38:29] SPEAKER_00: you probably will also see McKinsey and Accenture
[00:38:31] SPEAKER_00: and others benefit.
[00:38:32] SPEAKER_00: And the Fortune 100 also will have to evolve.
[00:38:35] SPEAKER_00: Our focus more though on creation
[00:38:37] SPEAKER_00: is incubating these companies
[00:38:39] SPEAKER_00: and more fragmented industries where you don't necessarily
[00:38:42] SPEAKER_00: even have the resources to go to a McKinsey or Accenture
[00:38:45] SPEAKER_00: if you want to add AI implementation.
[00:38:48] Because of General Catalyst's very large platform
[00:38:52] SPEAKER_02: that you have, how do the private market investments
[00:38:56] SPEAKER_02: help determine or inform these companies?
[00:38:59] SPEAKER_02: Are you partnering with any of them for them?
[00:39:02] SPEAKER_02: How does Anthropic fit in here?
[00:39:05] SPEAKER_02: And what are you learning from them?
[00:39:06] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, so with Anthropic,
[00:39:08] SPEAKER_00: we're kind of learning where are the models going?
[00:39:09] SPEAKER_00: So there's always a new release every three months,
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_00: six months, we're better understanding
[00:39:14] SPEAKER_00: what are the tasks that these models can do,
[00:39:16] SPEAKER_00: especially as logic and reasoning is better.
[00:39:18] SPEAKER_00: And then we have portfolio companies like Rocks,
[00:39:21] SPEAKER_00: which is taking on Salesforce, for example,
[00:39:23] SPEAKER_00: and it's more AI native,
[00:39:25] SPEAKER_00: or UDIA, which is focused on the legal space,
[00:39:27] SPEAKER_00: also more AI native,
[00:39:29] SPEAKER_00: Serval, which came out of Stelt last week,
[00:39:32] SPEAKER_00: which is taking on ServiceNow in a more AI-enabled way.
[00:39:35] SPEAKER_00: So we're working closely with Percepta
[00:39:36] SPEAKER_00: to let them know about the companies and the portfolio,
[00:39:39] SPEAKER_00: what they're seeing both in terms of model improvements
[00:39:41] SPEAKER_00: and also product improvements.
[00:39:43] SPEAKER_00: And then Percepta is getting this real life view
[00:39:45] SPEAKER_00: of everything going on as well as a CAN in AI
[00:39:48] SPEAKER_00: and then is able to help
[00:39:49] SPEAKER_00: that's Fortune 100 clients implement all this new technology,
[00:39:52] SPEAKER_00: a lot of which our team is helping identify and pass up to them.
[00:39:56] SPEAKER_00: This was a good question from Kyle Harrison,
[00:39:58] SPEAKER_02: but he wanted to ask,
[00:40:01] SPEAKER_02: how do you decide when to choose
[00:40:03] SPEAKER_02: from building an AI roll up
[00:40:05] SPEAKER_02: or investing in other SaaS company?
[00:40:07] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's a really good question.
[00:40:09] SPEAKER_00: One answer to that is percent automation.
[00:40:11] SPEAKER_00: So if we think a space is gonna be 90 or 100% automated,
[00:40:16] SPEAKER_00: then probably software is the best solution.
[00:40:18] SPEAKER_00: And honestly, an incumbent like Microsoft
[00:40:20] SPEAKER_00: or Amazon or Google that has the distribution
[00:40:22] SPEAKER_00: can just push the software,
[00:40:24] SPEAKER_00: it can be part of your Google workplace
[00:40:26] SPEAKER_00: or your prime subscription.
[00:40:28] SPEAKER_00: So if something is 100% automatable,
[00:40:30] SPEAKER_00: it probably should be a software or a genetic solution.
[00:40:33] SPEAKER_00: And then most likely the winner there could be a fast growing company,
[00:40:36] SPEAKER_00: but also is very likely someone who just already has the distribution.
[00:40:40] SPEAKER_00: So if coding gets fully automated,
[00:40:42] SPEAKER_00: maybe it can just be pushed through by Google
[00:40:44] SPEAKER_00: or Microsoft or someone else.
[00:40:46] SPEAKER_00: So one thing we're careful about in the AI-enabled roll ups
[00:40:49] SPEAKER_00: is we target 30% automation at least,
[00:40:52] SPEAKER_00: but we actually don't want more than 70% automation.
[00:40:54] SPEAKER_00: Because if something is approaching 80, 90, or 100% automation,
[00:40:57] SPEAKER_00: then there's really not the people services part of it.
[00:41:00] SPEAKER_00: So that's one important part.
[00:41:02] SPEAKER_00: The second thing is fragmentation.
[00:41:04] SPEAKER_00: Like when the industry is really hard to sell into,
[00:41:06] SPEAKER_00: imagine creating AI native software
[00:41:08] SPEAKER_00: for homeowner association, H.O.A. management.
[00:41:11] SPEAKER_00: Like that's just extremely hard to sell into.
[00:41:13] SPEAKER_00: So you could create an amazing product, I'm sure,
[00:41:15] SPEAKER_00: but your sales process would be very, very slow.
[00:41:18] SPEAKER_00: So the second thing we look for is, hey, it's very fragmented
[00:41:21] SPEAKER_00: and it's hard to sell in a SaaS product to these businesses.
[00:41:25] SPEAKER_00: And then the third thing we look for is,
[00:41:27] SPEAKER_00: it has to be a really sticky.
[00:41:28] SPEAKER_00: Like with H.O.A. management, it's a two-year contract.
[00:41:31] SPEAKER_00: So it's important that it's a low-churn business
[00:41:33] SPEAKER_00: where we can go in, we can do all this AI implementation,
[00:41:36] SPEAKER_00: and there will be some hiccups along the way,
[00:41:38] SPEAKER_00: but we can kind of smooth those over
[00:41:39] SPEAKER_00: and we have these kind of loyal clients.
[00:41:41] SPEAKER_00: Accounting is another really good space
[00:41:43] SPEAKER_00: where there's very low-churn that we're in,
[00:41:45] SPEAKER_00: or insurance, or MSPs.
[00:41:47] SPEAKER_00: And so those are the things we look for.
[00:41:49] SPEAKER_00: We do think that software services will win out
[00:41:51] SPEAKER_00: in areas that are more than 80% automatable,
[00:41:54] SPEAKER_00: or it's easy to sell into your client base,
[00:41:56] SPEAKER_00: who have a few large tech customers.
[00:41:58] SPEAKER_00: There are plenty of areas where it really makes sense
[00:42:00] SPEAKER_00: to be more of a software solution.
[00:42:02] SPEAKER_00: That said, we think there's also this really big market
[00:42:04] SPEAKER_00: for AI-nable roll-ups, especially in things like services.
[00:42:08] SPEAKER_02: Well, to shift a little bit,
[00:42:10] source-free sponsored by Brex.
[00:42:12] SPEAKER_02: Amazing.
[00:42:12] SPEAKER_02: We love Brex.
[00:42:14] SPEAKER_02: They're all about spending smart and moving faster
[00:42:16] SPEAKER_02: and performance.
[00:42:17] SPEAKER_02: When you're working and you're building on these companies,
[00:42:20] SPEAKER_02: what are the metrics that you use to determine
[00:42:23] SPEAKER_02: their performance?
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_02: I would assume some of it's a little abstract
[00:42:26] SPEAKER_02: because it's like team and that's where things.
[00:42:28] SPEAKER_02: But how do you measure performance?
[00:42:31] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and the first branch of funding,
[00:42:33] SPEAKER_00: what we're targeting is this 30% automation.
[00:42:35] SPEAKER_00: So go out and get 10 clients,
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_00: or get five-pipe clients,
[00:42:39] SPEAKER_00: but really show us the software you can build,
[00:42:41] SPEAKER_00: or the agent workforce you can build,
[00:42:43] SPEAKER_00: and then come back to us and map out
[00:42:45] SPEAKER_00: if you look at all the man hours in a company,
[00:42:47] SPEAKER_00: our 30% could you automate with the products
[00:42:50] SPEAKER_00: that you have built or stitched together?
[00:42:52] SPEAKER_00: And so that's the first really key metric.
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_00: Then the second key metric is when we go
[00:42:56] SPEAKER_00: and actually buy companies,
[00:42:57] SPEAKER_00: we're looking for how are you improving the margin.
[00:43:00] SPEAKER_00: So you've automated 30% or more,
[00:43:02] SPEAKER_00: how's that flowing through to margin?
[00:43:03] SPEAKER_00: And we want a really detailed plan
[00:43:05] SPEAKER_00: of how to double your EBITDA margin,
[00:43:07] SPEAKER_00: generally from the 15 to 20 range to 30 to 40%.
[00:43:10] SPEAKER_00: So that's kind of the second really key metric.
[00:43:12] SPEAKER_00: Once you start showing us, you're there,
[00:43:14] SPEAKER_00: or you're on track to get there,
[00:43:15] SPEAKER_00: that's the second really important metric.
[00:43:18] SPEAKER_00: And then the third is now you're growing
[00:43:19] SPEAKER_00: and you're scaling and you're moving quickly,
[00:43:21] SPEAKER_00: well, what multiples are you buying these businesses at?
[00:43:24] SPEAKER_00: And how quickly do you get those multiples down
[00:43:26] SPEAKER_00: as you improve the margin profile
[00:43:28] SPEAKER_00: and the EBITDA profile as well?
[00:43:30] SPEAKER_00: And so then we get a bit more sensitive to entry multiples
[00:43:33] SPEAKER_00: and doing things like smaller tucking acquisitions
[00:43:35] SPEAKER_00: and using debt.
[00:43:36] SPEAKER_00: And then the final one is just dilution.
[00:43:39] SPEAKER_00: Like we want the founders of these companies
[00:43:40] SPEAKER_00: to salon at least 10% of their business
[00:43:42] SPEAKER_00: and they go public, ideally 20 or even 30.
[00:43:44] SPEAKER_00: And so that's also a really important metric.
[00:43:47] SPEAKER_00: Are you compounding now with your own free cash flow
[00:43:50] SPEAKER_00: and with debt financing towards the later rounds
[00:43:52] SPEAKER_00: so that you can still own a big chunk of your company
[00:43:54] SPEAKER_00: when you go public?
[00:43:55] SPEAKER_00: And of course, we at GC can own a big chunk,
[00:43:57] SPEAKER_00: ideally also 20 to 25% when these companies go public.
[00:44:00] SPEAKER_00: So a really large concentrated position in things
[00:44:02] SPEAKER_00: that we think can be a really massive outcome.
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_00: So along the way, we have these different metrics
[00:44:07] SPEAKER_00: sort of for each stage of the AI and it will roll up.
[00:44:10] SPEAKER_00: That's highly concentrated.
[00:44:12] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, for sure.
[00:44:14] This is a really difficult question.
[00:44:16] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:44:17] Where are these businesses located?
[00:44:19] SPEAKER_02: Where have you traveled to?
[00:44:20] SPEAKER_02: Right, well, the holding companies that we help incubate
[00:44:23] SPEAKER_00: and fund are pretty much exclusively in San Francisco
[00:44:26] SPEAKER_00: in New York.
[00:44:27] SPEAKER_00: So out of the eight or nine deals that we've done,
[00:44:30] SPEAKER_00: thick six are here and two or three are in New York.
[00:44:32] SPEAKER_00: So we have seen that talent has come back,
[00:44:36] SPEAKER_00: for sure, to the Bay Area.
[00:44:37] SPEAKER_00: It's like the center of applied AI, research AI,
[00:44:41] SPEAKER_00: and then New York too for financial services, especially
[00:44:44] SPEAKER_00: and some of the really great M&A specialists
[00:44:46] SPEAKER_00: for people who have built and sold companies are out there.
[00:44:49] SPEAKER_00: So we're primarily working with really experienced entrepreneurs,
[00:44:51] SPEAKER_00: second time founders, amazing operators,
[00:44:54] SPEAKER_00: and they tend to be between SF New York.
[00:44:57] SPEAKER_00: Then the companies, once we created the whole coast
[00:44:59] SPEAKER_00: and they create the software, we show the automation now,
[00:45:01] SPEAKER_00: we're actually buying businesses.
[00:45:03] SPEAKER_00: Those are almost never in San Francisco or New York,
[00:45:05] SPEAKER_00: they're all across the country.
[00:45:07] SPEAKER_00: Increasingly, it's getting more global.
[00:45:09] SPEAKER_00: We invested two rounds in a company called Dwelly,
[00:45:11] SPEAKER_00: which is out in London, which is rolling up property management
[00:45:14] SPEAKER_00: and scaling really well and also doubling the EBITDA margin
[00:45:17] SPEAKER_00: of the property managers they're buying.
[00:45:18] SPEAKER_00: And we've also done a deal in Germany in the accounting space.
[00:45:22] SPEAKER_00: And so increasingly now, well, my answer was at first US,
[00:45:26] SPEAKER_00: we also have bets in like UK and Germany,
[00:45:28] SPEAKER_00: and we're looking at this strategy really closely in India too.
[00:45:31] SPEAKER_00: And Europe has much lower entry multiples.
[00:45:34] SPEAKER_00: People sometimes rad on Europe that's hard to build
[00:45:36] SPEAKER_00: a big company because there's so many markets.
[00:45:38] SPEAKER_00: In some ways, the AI and Apple Rollup is really perfect for that
[00:45:41] SPEAKER_00: because we can buy our way into new markets and iterate
[00:45:43] SPEAKER_00: and it's the same backend technology
[00:45:45] SPEAKER_00: to automate accounting, for example.
[00:45:47] SPEAKER_00: And so increasingly, this will be a more global strategy.
[00:45:49] SPEAKER_00: But today, it's been New York SF, London and Berlin.
[00:45:54] When you go global, do you keep the teams here in the US
[00:45:58] SPEAKER_02: and then the operations over it?
[00:46:00] SPEAKER_02: Like how does that work?
[00:46:01] SPEAKER_02: We normally invest in a separate company to do
[00:46:05] SPEAKER_00: each way a property management rollup, for example,
[00:46:07] SPEAKER_00: in the UK, which is Dwelle and they'll expand
[00:46:10] SPEAKER_00: to broader Europe, for example.
[00:46:12] SPEAKER_00: So right now, none of our rollups are really working internationally
[00:46:17] SPEAKER_00: with the exception of one that's rolling up software companies
[00:46:20] SPEAKER_00: and they're based in Canada, but are between Canada and the US.
[00:46:23] I mean, more on the talent side, is the talent
[00:46:26] SPEAKER_02: in those geographies as I'd say, like AI native,
[00:46:31] SPEAKER_02: as they could be in the US?
[00:46:32] SPEAKER_02: Like how does that quality wise compare?
[00:46:35] SPEAKER_02: I think it's less US versus international
[00:46:37] SPEAKER_00: and sort of SF Bay Area versus everyone else.
[00:46:40] SPEAKER_00: I think SF just is a much higher density of talent
[00:46:44] SPEAKER_00: and quality of talent than really anywhere else in the world.
[00:46:47] SPEAKER_00: But I think it is exciting that there's a lot more homegrown,
[00:46:50] SPEAKER_00: great companies in New York and in London and Berlin
[00:46:53] SPEAKER_00: and the quality of talent is rising in all of these other places.
[00:46:56] SPEAKER_00: So much so that we definitely are investing more in Europe
[00:46:59] SPEAKER_00: and investing more in India.
[00:47:00] SPEAKER_00: But in terms of where's the absolute top tier talent
[00:47:03] SPEAKER_00: in the world, I think it's still here in the Bay Area.
[00:47:05] SPEAKER_00: There's nothing special about the Bay Area,
[00:47:07] SPEAKER_00: except for a track soul.
[00:47:08] SPEAKER_00: They're really great people to leave wherever they are
[00:47:11] SPEAKER_00: and come work here.
[00:47:12] SPEAKER_00: So that's been the draw.
[00:47:13] SPEAKER_00: You've been a general catalyst for a couple of years now.
[00:47:17] SPEAKER_02: What is the biggest lesson that you've learned from her mom?
[00:47:20] Definitely advocating on team and paying up when you have to.
[00:47:25] SPEAKER_00: Like I got to learn from HT some epic stories
[00:47:28] SPEAKER_00: about how GC got involved in Stripe.
[00:47:30] SPEAKER_00: And I won't repeat all of the details there.
[00:47:33] SPEAKER_00: But there are some companies you just really want to be in.
[00:47:36] SPEAKER_00: And it's less about the terms.
[00:47:38] SPEAKER_00: It's more about catch them early.
[00:47:40] SPEAKER_00: Like you can buy 10 or 20% of an iconic company at C or at A or at B.
[00:47:46] SPEAKER_00: So a lot of people have the mentality of, oh, this is a $100 million check.
[00:47:49] SPEAKER_00: Let's spend all our time.
[00:47:50] SPEAKER_00: This is more important than like a 1 million seed check.
[00:47:52] SPEAKER_00: But the reality is normally your 100 million check
[00:47:54] SPEAKER_00: is buying you 10% of a company.
[00:47:56] SPEAKER_00: Your C check for 1 million is also buying you 10% of the company.
[00:48:00] SPEAKER_00: So it's really important to kind of what
[00:48:02] SPEAKER_00: are going to be the next 50 iconic companies and ideally
[00:48:05] SPEAKER_00: try to catch them early and pay just as much attention
[00:48:08] SPEAKER_00: to buying 10% of some seed businesses, 10% of an established
[00:48:12] SPEAKER_00: business.
[00:48:13] SPEAKER_00: So we have really a GC shifted a lot our focus on seed
[00:48:17] SPEAKER_00: with that position of Lafamilia bringing in Jeanette
[00:48:20] SPEAKER_00: and who's running our Europe practice.
[00:48:21] SPEAKER_00: And is a very prolific seed investor from Lafamilia, Ventura
[00:48:25] SPEAKER_00: Highway, the India seed firm that we also acquired.
[00:48:29] SPEAKER_00: We brought in recently.
[00:48:30] SPEAKER_00: And then Yuri to come lead our USC practice.
[00:48:32] SPEAKER_00: He had a successful seed firm.
[00:48:34] SPEAKER_00: So I think that mentality we're really pushing through,
[00:48:36] SPEAKER_00: which is can we buy 10 to 20% of companies early rather than
[00:48:40] SPEAKER_00: certain types of investments or more important than others?
[00:48:43] SPEAKER_00: It's really how do we get those iconic companies 10 or 20% of them?
[00:48:46] SPEAKER_00: So intense.
[00:48:47] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:48:48] SPEAKER_00: There's a lot going on there.
[00:48:50] There's a lot going on.
[00:48:52] So what are you most looking forward to in the next 12 months?
[00:48:56] SPEAKER_02: In the next 12 months, I think coming much more public
[00:48:59] SPEAKER_00: about our thesis, some of our best rollups
[00:49:02] SPEAKER_00: have decided not to do any press whatsoever,
[00:49:05] SPEAKER_00: which I think is, I can understand where they're coming from,
[00:49:07] SPEAKER_00: their cash flow positive.
[00:49:09] SPEAKER_00: Now, some of the companies in the rollup
[00:49:11] SPEAKER_00: will hit 100 million of EBITDA and they're less than two years old.
[00:49:13] SPEAKER_00: Oh my god.
[00:49:14] SPEAKER_00: We have companies like that who say, for generating
[00:49:17] SPEAKER_00: hundreds of millions of free cash flow,
[00:49:18] SPEAKER_00: we don't need to be out fundraising every three to six months
[00:49:21] SPEAKER_00: and doing the press tour and promising people
[00:49:23] SPEAKER_00: AGI's around the corner.
[00:49:25] SPEAKER_00: Like, if you have a good business and you're making a lot of money
[00:49:28] SPEAKER_00: and you're seeing AI implementation really working,
[00:49:31] SPEAKER_00: a lot of our companies have remained really quiet
[00:49:33] SPEAKER_00: or more stealthy despite doing amazing.
[00:49:36] SPEAKER_00: But I am excited to hear these stories come out much more
[00:49:39] SPEAKER_00: publicly and obviously we'll send them your way as well.
[00:49:42] SPEAKER_00: But in the next six months or a year,
[00:49:44] SPEAKER_00: as we have these amazing proof points that I get to see
[00:49:46] SPEAKER_00: being on the board and many of these companies,
[00:49:48] SPEAKER_00: we're going to start telling our story much more to the world
[00:49:51] SPEAKER_00: with an angle of working now with more crossover firms
[00:49:54] SPEAKER_00: starting to prepare them to go public.
[00:49:56] SPEAKER_00: It's really an amazing journey.
[00:49:57] SPEAKER_00: For me, it feels a lot like in 2016 in crypto,
[00:50:00] SPEAKER_00: there were a few people who thought it was legit,
[00:50:01] SPEAKER_00: like USB and A16z.
[00:50:03] SPEAKER_00: But most of the market was just trying to be polite
[00:50:06] SPEAKER_00: because they didn't want to offend USB and A16z
[00:50:08] SPEAKER_00: and Founders Fund, which was obviously really involved
[00:50:11] SPEAKER_00: directly in Bitcoin.
[00:50:13] SPEAKER_00: They were just trying to be polite,
[00:50:14] SPEAKER_00: but they didn't really believe in it or a few.
[00:50:16] SPEAKER_00: I think we're kind of there in the AI rollup right now,
[00:50:18] SPEAKER_00: where ourselves and Elon and Thrive and a few others,
[00:50:22] SPEAKER_00: ABC have embraced it.
[00:50:24] SPEAKER_00: But I think most of the market is still pretty skeptical,
[00:50:27] SPEAKER_00: similar to the crypto evolution and where Bitcoin
[00:50:29] SPEAKER_00: and stablecoins are today.
[00:50:30] SPEAKER_00: You see very few people who say,
[00:50:32] SPEAKER_00: hey, there's not value there.
[00:50:33] SPEAKER_00: It's not interesting.
[00:50:35] SPEAKER_00: I think that'll be us in a few years too.
[00:50:36] SPEAKER_00: So it's been really fun, again,
[00:50:38] SPEAKER_00: being on what I think is like a journey
[00:50:39] SPEAKER_00: that will most definitely be proven true.
[00:50:41] SPEAKER_00: Oh, so fascinating and really cool to capture it
[00:50:44] SPEAKER_02: at this point in time.
[00:50:46] Absolutely.
[00:50:46] I'm really excited to do a rapid fire interview
[00:50:49] SPEAKER_02: with every single one of the companies.
[00:50:52] No, I think they should definitely do more press.
[00:50:54] SPEAKER_00: And we have a few that are starting to do more,
[00:50:56] SPEAKER_00: including Titan MSP and UDIA and Crescendo,
[00:50:59] SPEAKER_00: but we're excited for the rest too as well.
[00:51:01] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:51:01] SPEAKER_00: Well, Mark, it was a pleasure to have you on.
