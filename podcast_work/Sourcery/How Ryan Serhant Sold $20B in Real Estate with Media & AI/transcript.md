[00:00:00] A city needs to be run by a CEO.
[00:00:02] Ryan Serhant: Like you need somebody who is moving for the betterment of the company.
[00:00:06] Ryan Serhant: Like where can we delete inefficiencies?
[00:00:08] Ryan Serhant: Take like a phrase from Musk.
[00:00:10] Ryan Serhant: Like where can we find opportunities to improve?
[00:00:13] Ryan Serhant: You're CEO.
[00:00:13] Ryan Serhant: We've built a $14 billion empire.
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_02: Okay, first of all, I don't know how to tell you that.
[00:00:18] Ryan Serhant: It's not $14 billion.
[00:00:20] Ryan Serhant: I've done 20 billion in sales over 20 at this point.
[00:00:23] Ryan Serhant: Since January 1 of this year, simple has completed over 12,000 automated tasks,
[00:00:28] Ryan Serhant: which has saved 15,000 working human hours for our people.
[00:00:32] Ryan Serhant: I brand, I expand it myself.
[00:00:34] Ryan Serhant: You've raised $45 million for this.
[00:00:37] I did it by myself.
[00:00:38] Ryan Serhant: Like an idiot.
[00:00:39] Ryan Serhant: Probably could have raised so much.
[00:00:40] Ryan Serhant: No, just the other biggest check was left lane capital.
[00:00:43] Ryan Serhant: So hardly a miller in those guys.
[00:00:44] Ryan Serhant: I have left lane.
[00:00:47] Ryan Serhant: And they're in the show.
[00:00:50] Ryan Serhant: So season two, I've never seen this in a reality show.
[00:00:53] Ryan Serhant: Season two is supposed to be...
[00:00:54] Ryan Serhant: We have these.
[00:00:54] Ryan Serhant: ...sees in a reality TV show?
[00:00:56] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it follows.
[00:00:57] Ryan Serhant: Oh my god.
[00:00:58] Ryan Serhant: It follows the rays.
[00:00:59] Ryan Serhant: What?
[00:00:59] Ryan Serhant: It follows the rays.
[00:01:00] Ryan Serhant: And I thought Netflix was going to cut it.
[00:01:12] Ryan, Sir Hand, welcome to Sorcery.
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_02: Thank you for having me.
[00:01:15] Ryan Serhant: What a beautiful library.
[00:01:16] Ryan Serhant: This is, you know, not much, but a tone.
[00:01:19] For today, yeah.
[00:01:20] Ryan Serhant: For today.
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, welcome to the Stock Exchange.
[00:01:23] Ryan Serhant: Excited.
[00:01:23] Ryan Serhant: Let's dig into it.
[00:01:25] So you are one of the most popular people in New York City.
[00:01:27] SPEAKER_02: That's not true.
[00:01:28] Ryan Serhant: It is.
[00:01:29] SPEAKER_02: Everyone knows you.
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_02: And you've built a $14 billion empire.
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_02: Okay, first of all, I don't know who told you that.
[00:01:36] It's not $14 billion.
[00:01:38] Ryan Serhant: I've done 20 billion in sales over 20 at this point.
[00:01:41] Ryan Serhant: You need to update the websites then.
[00:01:43] Okay, okay.
[00:01:44] Ryan Serhant: When you say on this podcast,
[00:01:46] Ryan Serhant: billions of dollars, I think people are probably going to
[00:01:48] Ryan Serhant: associate that with valuation.
[00:01:50] Ryan Serhant: I don't think our company is worth $14 billion yet.
[00:01:53] Ryan Serhant: But I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't want it to be there.
[00:01:56] Ryan Serhant: We operate a holding company called Sir Hand Technologies.
[00:01:59] Ryan Serhant: And underneath that, we own a cloud real estate brokerage.
[00:02:02] Ryan Serhant: So the brokerage now operates in 13 states.
[00:02:04] Ryan Serhant: I'll be in 15 by the end of 2025.
[00:02:07] Ryan Serhant: And then we'll be fully national by next year.
[00:02:09] Ryan Serhant: We operate a production company called Studios.
[00:02:12] Ryan Serhant: So Sir Hand Studios, we have a Netflix show called
[00:02:14] Ryan Serhant: Oningman Hatton.
[00:02:15] Ryan Serhant: We do top of funnel lead gen for sales people
[00:02:18] Ryan Serhant: so that we can provide leads to sales people at zero cack.
[00:02:22] Ryan Serhant: We then have a sales training company called
[00:02:25] Ryan Serhant: sellit.com, which is massive.
[00:02:26] Ryan Serhant: That has over 40,000 enrollees, I guess at this point,
[00:02:30] Ryan Serhant: 130 countries.
[00:02:31] Ryan Serhant: We sell through them.
[00:02:32] Ryan Serhant: And they're also, we recruit through them, right,
[00:02:35] Ryan Serhant: all over the world.
[00:02:37] Ryan Serhant: And then we have Simple, which is our AI workflow service
[00:02:40] Ryan Serhant: that gets a lot of attention.
[00:02:41] Ryan Serhant: But I focus on a lot of the other stuff too.
[00:02:45] Ryan Serhant: And you became so popular because of the media.
[00:02:47] SPEAKER_02: So I'm curious, like, when did you decide to take the media side
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_02: so seriously?
[00:02:50] SPEAKER_02: The media took me seriously.
[00:02:52] Ryan Serhant: It wasn't a, it was a happy accident.
[00:02:55] Ryan Serhant: I came to New York City after college in 2006 to do theater.
[00:03:00] Ryan Serhant: And I ran out of money.
[00:03:02] And so I had to get a job.
[00:03:03] Ryan Serhant: And it was go back to school, which sounded terrible,
[00:03:06] Ryan Serhant: or move home, which was way worse.
[00:03:08] Ryan Serhant: Or bartends, you know, do a survival job.
[00:03:11] Ryan Serhant: And so I got my real estate license because a friend said
[00:03:14] Ryan Serhant: it was just like theater.
[00:03:15] Ryan Serhant: It's all game of improv.
[00:03:16] Ryan Serhant: You meet someone on the streets.
[00:03:17] Ryan Serhant: They say I want to find an apartment.
[00:03:18] Ryan Serhant: You say yes and yes and it's just
[00:03:21] acting is selling.
[00:03:22] Ryan Serhant: Right?
[00:03:22] Ryan Serhant: Except you're doing it authentically.
[00:03:24] Ryan Serhant: And it's not about taking from people.
[00:03:25] Ryan Serhant: It's about helping them make a decision.
[00:03:26] Ryan Serhant: They're going to make anyway.
[00:03:28] Ryan Serhant: Except now they get to make it with you
[00:03:29] Ryan Serhant: and not make it in a year or with somebody else.
[00:03:33] Ryan Serhant: So I got my real estate license.
[00:03:34] Ryan Serhant: Leighman Brothers filed for bankruptcy that morning.
[00:03:37] Ryan Serhant: And I was off to the races from there.
[00:03:39] Ryan Serhant: And so I put the theater thing to the side
[00:03:41] Ryan Serhant: because I had to make money.
[00:03:43] Ryan Serhant: Pay my rent to stay in the city.
[00:03:46] Ryan Serhant: And I was at the bottom of the barrel there.
[00:03:48] Ryan Serhant: And then I went to an open casting call
[00:03:51] Ryan Serhant: for Millennial Listing New York,
[00:03:52] Ryan Serhant: which was a TV show on Bravo.
[00:03:54] Ryan Serhant: And I was cast on that.
[00:03:55] Ryan Serhant: And that started in 2010.
[00:03:58] Show premiered in 2012.
[00:03:59] Ryan Serhant: And I did it for 10 years.
[00:04:02] So yeah, so that show and that show was a shotgun for me
[00:04:06] Ryan Serhant: into the real estate world.
[00:04:08] Ryan Serhant: You know, not into the, not into like general craziness.
[00:04:11] Ryan Serhant: But you know, it was a great way for me to create a community, right?
[00:04:17] Ryan Serhant: To build an audience that I could turn into a community.
[00:04:19] Ryan Serhant: That then when Instagram was invented right around the same exact time,
[00:04:23] Ryan Serhant: I just wasn't early adopter.
[00:04:26] Ryan Serhant: The same way with YouTube.
[00:04:27] Ryan Serhant: It had been around for a long time.
[00:04:28] Ryan Serhant: But it was mostly just for kids, etc.
[00:04:30] Ryan Serhant: And we were, you know, we were doing property tours in 2014 and 2015.
[00:04:34] Ryan Serhant: 10 and 11 years ago.
[00:04:36] Ryan Serhant: Just trying to say, hey, I can get this audience on Bravo.
[00:04:40] That I can sell property through because it syndicates to an international audience.
[00:04:44] Ryan Serhant: But by the time people see it, it's been a year since I shot it.
[00:04:48] And my listing agreements are six months long.
[00:04:50] Ryan Serhant: I've got to have sold it.
[00:04:51] Ryan Serhant: So what if I could do that by tomorrow, right?
[00:04:53] Ryan Serhant: How can I move forward really, really quickly?
[00:04:55] Ryan Serhant: And so that's what we started doing on YouTube and on Instagram and Facebook.
[00:05:00] Ryan Serhant: And we started building an early, early audience just really attacking our niche.
[00:05:05] Ryan Serhant: And it's just grown since then.
[00:05:06] Ryan Serhant: And you have studios in house.
[00:05:09] Yeah, one of them sitting here not paying attention.
[00:05:10] Ryan Serhant: His name is Danny.
[00:05:11] Ryan Serhant: That's him right there.
[00:05:12] Ryan Serhant: And it's just here is my, my friend.
[00:05:15] Ryan Serhant: So Danny, yeah, studios is in house.
[00:05:19] Ryan Serhant: We have a head of studios who's based in New York City.
[00:05:20] Ryan Serhant: And then we have studios in every market that we're in for real estate.
[00:05:24] Ryan Serhant: But it's a, you know, 35, 40 person team.
[00:05:29] And in interview, you did with David Weisberg on 10X.
[00:05:32] SPEAKER_02: You were talking about how you're a media company that you sell real estate.
[00:05:35] SPEAKER_02: And I thought that was a really refreshing perspective because I come from the investing world.
[00:05:40] SPEAKER_02: I kind of feel silly sometimes doing media.
[00:05:42] SPEAKER_02: And it seems a little like forced, but you're actually really owning it.
[00:05:48] And I know that's like more in your DNA.
[00:05:49] SPEAKER_02: But do you think that that is like a principle that most people need to take on in this new media
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_02: environment, like the new internet?
[00:05:56] SPEAKER_02: Everybody's like, there's I buyers, there's people online.
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_02: It's discovery is different.
[00:06:02] I think it's just a reframe.
[00:06:05] Ryan Serhant: Instead of a rebirth of an idea or a redirection of brand,
[00:06:10] Ryan Serhant: it's just a reframe.
[00:06:12] Ryan Serhant: And when I started the company in 2020, so, you know,
[00:06:14] Ryan Serhant: I did my own listing.
[00:06:15] Ryan Serhant: We did three spin-off shows, started writing books, all that stuff.
[00:06:18] Ryan Serhant: I did like, I don't know, I can't remember.
[00:06:21] Ryan Serhant: 1.2 or 1.3 billion in sales in 2019.
[00:06:23] Ryan Serhant: And said, I gotta go do this on my own now.
[00:06:25] Ryan Serhant: Like we were the most successful residential real estate brokerage team in the United States
[00:06:30] Ryan Serhant: for four years in a row.
[00:06:32] Ryan Serhant: The only choice was to go do my own thing and go back to the bottom.
[00:06:36] Ryan Serhant: So I rose to number one that way.
[00:06:37] Ryan Serhant: And now how am I going to go right back to the bottom?
[00:06:40] Ryan Serhant: And what am I going to do?
[00:06:41] Ryan Serhant: I'm going to go out there and say, hey, Ryan started a real estate company.
[00:06:44] Ryan Serhant: No one cares.
[00:06:46] Ryan Serhant: And then how would I differentiate myself from the legacy firms?
[00:06:49] Ryan Serhant: And what problem am I really solving?
[00:06:52] Ryan Serhant: Just Ryan wants to start his own company that doesn't solve a great problem.
[00:06:56] Ryan Serhant: Or just to make money.
[00:06:58] Doesn't really solve a great problem.
[00:07:00] Ryan Serhant: Not a scalable problem anyway.
[00:07:03] Ryan Serhant: And so I said, what is our real value problem?
[00:07:06] Ryan Serhant: We can put properties in front of more qualified buyers globally,
[00:07:10] Ryan Serhant: organically than any other firm combined.
[00:07:13] Ryan Serhant: Okay, that's interesting.
[00:07:15] Ryan Serhant: I could do that.
[00:07:17] Ryan Serhant: How do I turn that into a solve, though?
[00:07:20] Ryan Serhant: What it really came down to is where either a real estate company that uses media and technology,
[00:07:25] Ryan Serhant: or we are a media technology company that just so happens to sell real estate.
[00:07:32] And when we said that, we then aligned on a singular purpose.
[00:07:36] Ryan Serhant: Right.
[00:07:37] Ryan Serhant: And so then our purpose can inform the people that we get to hire.
[00:07:40] Ryan Serhant: And then the people get to inform the product that we get to sell.
[00:07:44] Ryan Serhant: Because now I can sell real estate in any market, residential, commercial.
[00:07:48] Ryan Serhant: We can do multi-family leasing.
[00:07:49] Ryan Serhant: I can sell sales training.
[00:07:51] Ryan Serhant: I can sell media.
[00:07:52] Ryan Serhant: We can sell pillows.
[00:07:55] Ryan Serhant: And then if you have all three lined up, right,
[00:07:58] Ryan Serhant: the purpose, the people in the product, then you can get to profit.
[00:08:01] Ryan Serhant: So focused on the money last and it's worked so far.
[00:08:04] Ryan Serhant: Yeah, it's really impressive.
[00:08:06] SPEAKER_02: And it's a shift that is happening really strongly in the venture world,
[00:08:10] SPEAKER_02: like in the last two years.
[00:08:12] SPEAKER_02: A company that we had on recently was Open Door.
[00:08:15] SPEAKER_02: And so what they have done is they built a cult following sort of like the community that you're
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_02: talking about.
[00:08:21] SPEAKER_02: What do you think it takes to build one of these communities?
[00:08:24] Authenticity.
[00:08:25] Ryan Serhant: First and foremost, vulnerability.
[00:08:28] Ryan Serhant: People don't care about your wins.
[00:08:29] Ryan Serhant: They want to connect with you on your losses.
[00:08:32] Ryan Serhant: So I think we've been really, really clear by letting people know across all of our businesses
[00:08:36] Ryan Serhant: and everything I do personally, my job is not to win my job is to lose.
[00:08:40] And I do that all day every day.
[00:08:41] Ryan Serhant: I lose deals, I lose pitches, I lose, but this, that, the other,
[00:08:45] Ryan Serhant: and the wins are then my bonus.
[00:08:46] Ryan Serhant: And I think for sales people, they align with us.
[00:08:49] Ryan Serhant: And there's a real culture that we've created and following.
[00:08:54] Ryan Serhant: And I think that's why cult is in culture.
[00:08:57] Ryan Serhant: I think that's why also my retention on customers is 99%.
[00:09:02] Ryan Serhant: Once you work with us, there would be nowhere else to go.
[00:09:05] Ryan Serhant: And we lean on that heavily, heavily, heavily.
[00:09:09] Ryan Serhant: But I think people, you know this, right?
[00:09:10] Ryan Serhant: People read through bullshit.
[00:09:12] Ryan Serhant: They don't like, they know when they're being sold to.
[00:09:14] Ryan Serhant: And you see it in your feeds too.
[00:09:16] Ryan Serhant: Like, you know when something's being pushed to,
[00:09:17] Ryan Serhant: and you know when something's like an authentic moment,
[00:09:19] Ryan Serhant: whether it's produced or not, you're like,
[00:09:21] Ryan Serhant: well, good job.
[00:09:22] Ryan Serhant: I'll watch this.
[00:09:23] Ryan Serhant: I'll give you a look.
[00:09:24] Ryan Serhant: I would just say, though, I've been doing this.
[00:09:27] Ryan Serhant: A long time.
[00:09:29] And I just caution a lot of people on chasing
[00:09:32] Ryan Serhant: virality, because if it's not an engaged
[00:09:37] customer, you don't know these people are.
[00:09:40] Ryan Serhant: It doesn't matter.
[00:09:40] Ryan Serhant: You're going to have a million views from where?
[00:09:44] Ryan Serhant: Where?
[00:09:44] Ryan Serhant: Who are these people?
[00:09:45] Ryan Serhant: Where are they?
[00:09:46] Ryan Serhant: And what call to action?
[00:09:47] Ryan Serhant: Are you really driving?
[00:09:49] Ryan Serhant: Right?
[00:09:49] Ryan Serhant: With this look, if you can do it consistently over time,
[00:09:52] Ryan Serhant: then sure, you can build something really, really amazing
[00:09:55] Ryan Serhant: with a great following, like the Savannah bananas.
[00:09:57] Ryan Serhant: Right?
[00:09:58] Ryan Serhant: We're slowly, but surely that engagement does turn into real
[00:10:01] Ryan Serhant: community that community turns into customers.
[00:10:03] Ryan Serhant: And you can kind of go from audience to community to content.
[00:10:07] Ryan Serhant: Right?
[00:10:07] Ryan Serhant: To commerce.
[00:10:10] Ryan Serhant: But a lot of people chase it, because I think it makes them feel good.
[00:10:14] Ryan Serhant: And I don't know what it actually does.
[00:10:17] Ryan Serhant: And so I try to steer people on the path of like,
[00:10:19] Ryan Serhant: if you do it for you, people will come.
[00:10:21] Ryan Serhant: If you do it for them, no one cares.

[00:11:26] SPEAKER_02: What's the most expensive listening you've sold through social media?
[00:11:30] SPEAKER_02: Through social.
[00:11:32] Ryan Serhant: I mean, we sell through social every day.
[00:11:34] Ryan Serhant: It's a huge part of what we do.
[00:11:37] We don't do deals in DMs.
[00:11:39] Ryan Serhant: That's physically impossible.
[00:11:42] Ryan Serhant: But like,
[00:11:44] in January, I got a call from a banker who knows me through social.
[00:11:53] Ryan Serhant: Emailed first that turned into a call,
[00:11:55] Ryan Serhant: who then said, I've clients who want to buy something in Florida.
[00:11:58] Ryan Serhant: Do you do Florida?
[00:11:58] Ryan Serhant: And I said, yes, we do Florida.
[00:12:00] Ryan Serhant: And I said, can I get them on the phone right now?
[00:12:01] Ryan Serhant: And I said, sure.
[00:12:03] Ryan Serhant: Told me who they are.
[00:12:04] Ryan Serhant: And I was like, no way.
[00:12:05] Ryan Serhant: You're bringing these people on the phone.
[00:12:06] Ryan Serhant: You brought them on.
[00:12:07] Ryan Serhant: I recognized the voice.
[00:12:08] Ryan Serhant: I said, hello.
[00:12:10] Ryan Serhant: They said we're going to buy something.
[00:12:11] Ryan Serhant: We don't think we need a real estate agent.
[00:12:12] Ryan Serhant: And I said, I think you're wrong.
[00:12:14] Ryan Serhant: And I explained why they would need one.
[00:12:16] Ryan Serhant: And they said we're going to call you back in five minutes.
[00:12:18] Ryan Serhant: And they did.
[00:12:19] And then we bought at the end of the day,
[00:12:23] Ryan Serhant: that deal is $308 million over the phone.
[00:12:28] Ryan Serhant: Not from social,
[00:12:30] Ryan Serhant: but the awareness was generated
[00:12:32] Ryan Serhant: through the media engine that we have created
[00:12:36] Ryan Serhant: that is in part on social media.
[00:12:39] Netflix is a huge help for me, though.
[00:12:41] Ryan Serhant: Yeah.
[00:12:41] Ryan Serhant: Bravo was a massive help.
[00:12:42] Ryan Serhant: I don't want to ignore that at all.
[00:12:44] Ryan Serhant: And we were,
[00:12:45] Ryan Serhant: a million dollar listing was on prime time cable for 10 years
[00:12:48] before streaming,
[00:12:50] before the way the world is today.
[00:12:52] Ryan Serhant: There was no TikTok to compete with
[00:12:53] Ryan Serhant: where people sitting there,
[00:12:54] Ryan Serhant: like you would watch TV
[00:12:55] Ryan Serhant: and you'd maybe look at the news,
[00:12:57] Ryan Serhant: but you weren't on your phone
[00:12:59] laughing here while watching here,
[00:13:01] Ryan Serhant: while on your laptop over here.
[00:13:03] Ryan Serhant: Right.
[00:13:03] Ryan Serhant: So it's a very, very different world now.
[00:13:04] Ryan Serhant: And Netflix has been a massive,
[00:13:08] Ryan Serhant: massive, international funnel.
[00:13:09] Ryan Serhant: Like it's just the craziest thing ever,
[00:13:12] Ryan Serhant: which we then grab audience for
[00:13:13] Ryan Serhant: and then put across our channels.
[00:13:15] Ryan Serhant: And we are fully prepared to squeeze that lemon while it's there.
[00:13:19] Ryan Serhant: What was the impact after the launch of owning Manhattan?
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_02: I mean, it changed my life.
[00:13:24] Ryan Serhant: When million dollar listing premiered in 2012,
[00:13:26] Ryan Serhant: my life changed, but not overnight.
[00:13:28] Ryan Serhant: Okay.
[00:13:29] Ryan Serhant: It took a while
[00:13:30] because you don't call people you see on TV.
[00:13:32] Ryan Serhant: It's weird.
[00:13:33] Ryan Serhant: Right.
[00:13:33] Ryan Serhant: So it took a while.
[00:13:34] Ryan Serhant: But what I learned from it initially was
[00:13:36] Ryan Serhant: I need a pitch tool.
[00:13:37] Ryan Serhant: So if I'm going to email you,
[00:13:38] Ryan Serhant: right, you live in Los Angeles.
[00:13:40] Ryan Serhant: I don't know what you want to buy.
[00:13:41] Ryan Serhant: Sell.
[00:13:42] Ryan Serhant: Do you need a place in New York?
[00:13:42] Ryan Serhant: You're coming here all the time.
[00:13:44] Ryan Serhant: You're the greatest podcaster.
[00:13:46] Female finance executive in the history of the world.
[00:13:48] Ryan Serhant: You definitely deserve a new apartment.
[00:13:50] Ryan Serhant: This that the other.
[00:13:51] Ryan Serhant: Also, I have this TV show.
[00:13:53] Ryan Serhant: And then you might respond or maybe not.
[00:13:56] Ryan Serhant: But it definitely did help open doors.
[00:13:58] Ryan Serhant: So it changed the true directory of my entire life.
[00:14:02] Ryan Serhant: And then only been happened hadn't last year.
[00:14:04] Ryan Serhant: And it changed life within like three weeks.
[00:14:07] Ryan Serhant: It was insanity.
[00:14:08] Ryan Serhant: Like we had lines
[00:14:10] Ryan Serhant: outside open houses.
[00:14:11] Ryan Serhant: And not just to the bed at betterment of surhand,
[00:14:13] Ryan Serhant: like my company.
[00:14:14] Ryan Serhant: Like we have people outside my office in Soho all day every day.
[00:14:17] Ryan Serhant: We have to put decals on the sidewalks to tell people where to stand
[00:14:20] Ryan Serhant: to take the best photo.
[00:14:21] Ryan Serhant: Otherwise, they come up and they bang on the door.
[00:14:23] Ryan Serhant: And they're like, can we,
[00:14:24] Ryan Serhant: and we're like, not just go across street.
[00:14:25] Ryan Serhant: It's better over there.
[00:14:27] Ryan Serhant: And so it's a lot because it's all over the world, right?
[00:14:29] Ryan Serhant: So when people think American real estate residential,
[00:14:33] Ryan Serhant: they, you know, they think they think us.
[00:14:35] Ryan Serhant: And so it's helpful.
[00:14:36] Ryan Serhant: But yeah, to the betterment of all of our other agents
[00:14:39] Ryan Serhant: and all of our other markets.
[00:14:40] Ryan Serhant: Because overnight, everyone's sitting at home.
[00:14:43] Ryan Serhant: It's top 10 in their feed.
[00:14:45] Ryan Serhant: They click on it.
[00:14:46] Ryan Serhant: They see the name.
[00:14:47] Ryan Serhant: There's 11 surhands on planet earth.
[00:14:49] Ryan Serhant: So they're like, well, that must be you.
[00:14:51] Ryan Serhant: Oh my gosh, there's that sign.
[00:14:52] Ryan Serhant: And it broke our website.
[00:14:55] Ryan Serhant: Traffic increased like 24, 100%.
[00:14:58] Ryan Serhant: Or something completely insane.
[00:15:00] Ryan Serhant: We had, we had agent recruits from all over the world coming through.
[00:15:05] Ryan Serhant: It was like 100 a minute.
[00:15:08] And social following, we were growing at, what was it?
[00:15:13] I mean, it was hundreds of thousands a day.
[00:15:14] Ryan Serhant: Like it was just, it was, it is the largest global distribution
[00:15:19] Ryan Serhant: funnel on planet earth, right?
[00:15:20] Ryan Serhant: Like you just can't, like YouTube is huge.
[00:15:23] But you have to know what you're looking for on YouTube.
[00:15:25] Ryan Serhant: Because it is so huge.
[00:15:27] Ryan Serhant: Netflix is very focused.
[00:15:29] Ryan Serhant: And it provides you.
[00:15:31] Ryan Serhant: And that first, you can, I mean, there's 10,000 shows.
[00:15:34] Ryan Serhant: But when you first log in, when a show first comes out,
[00:15:36] Ryan Serhant: you have 300 million people who get the choice of whether they want to click a button or not.
[00:15:40] Ryan Serhant: And you dare, I'm not to click.
[00:15:42] Ryan Serhant: And it changed everything.
[00:15:43] Ryan Serhant: And then we just milked that out of it.
[00:15:45] Ryan Serhant: I think we've been very, very good at taking advantage of, of opportunity.
[00:15:50] Ryan Serhant: And never, ever, ever letting go.
[00:15:53] Ryan Serhant: Jessica is one of the most popular people on the show.
[00:15:56] SPEAKER_02: How did you find her?
[00:15:57] SPEAKER_02: Like, what did you see in her for talent?
[00:16:00] SPEAKER_02: We took us a year to cast.
[00:16:03] Ryan Serhant: So we went through every real estate, I mean, I looked at my own agents.
[00:16:07] Ryan Serhant: I don't have our own agents.
[00:16:09] Ryan Serhant: Some are great for TV.
[00:16:10] Ryan Serhant: Some are just great brokers, but not good for TV, which is, which is different, right?
[00:16:14] Ryan Serhant: It's hard to find people who can do both.
[00:16:17] And so then we just started scrolling through every other real estate brokerage in New York,
[00:16:22] Ryan Serhant: as well as in other markets, because I like the idea of bringing somebody.
[00:16:25] Ryan Serhant: So there was a character named Savannah.
[00:16:27] Ryan Serhant: So she was in a pink North Carolina.
[00:16:31] Ryan Serhant: But in that first season, there was the tattoo guy.
[00:16:34] Ryan Serhant: He was a compass.
[00:16:35] Ryan Serhant: Jess Markowski, I think, was also a compass.
[00:16:38] Ryan Serhant: A couple of those other agents came over from element and some other firms where I was looking
[00:16:42] Ryan Serhant: for somebody who could have camera presence because it is a TV show.
[00:16:45] Ryan Serhant: And then when I spoke to them, do they have a personality?
[00:16:48] Ryan Serhant: Because you have to have a personality, otherwise no one's going to watch it.
[00:16:50] Ryan Serhant: And I was like, I don't want no dips in momentum.
[00:16:53] Ryan Serhant: Everyone's got to have their own Netflix TV show worth of story if you're going to be in the cast.
[00:17:00] Ryan Serhant: Otherwise, you can be background.
[00:17:03] Ryan Serhant: It's fine.
[00:17:04] Ryan Serhant: And she came in and she met and talked and she totally got it.
[00:17:07] Ryan Serhant: She understood and she actually does this.
[00:17:10] Ryan Serhant: She actually sells and sold in season one.
[00:17:12] Ryan Serhant: I think she does one of the first deals in season two.
[00:17:14] Ryan Serhant: And that comes out in December.
[00:17:16] Ryan Serhant: I know.
[00:17:16] Ryan Serhant: And she lets everybody know.
[00:17:18] Ryan Serhant: And then she got caught up in season one dramas.
[00:17:19] Ryan Serhant: That was fun.
[00:17:21] Ryan Serhant: That was hard on her.
[00:17:22] Ryan Serhant: Because I think it was public.
[00:17:24] Ryan Serhant: And she did some other crazy deals this year that have been very public.
[00:17:27] Ryan Serhant: In the New York Post, it's been wild.
[00:17:29] Ryan Serhant: She does business.
[00:17:32] Ryan Serhant: Was it the first time you casted something out?
[00:17:36] I'm like a fold.
[00:17:37] Ryan Serhant: Yeah.
[00:17:38] Ryan Serhant: I mean, in terms of a full cast, yes.
[00:17:39] Ryan Serhant: I did a show called Sell It Like Surhant.
[00:17:41] Ryan Serhant: When I wrote Sell Like Sur Ant,
[00:17:43] Ryan Serhant: and then did that show for Bravo.
[00:17:45] Ryan Serhant: And so we kind of had to cast all the businesses we went into
[00:17:48] Ryan Serhant: or I would teach these terrible sales people how to sell.
[00:17:52] Ryan Serhant: And then we cast for our shorts.
[00:17:53] Ryan Serhant: Like we have a YouTube thing called Listed,
[00:17:56] Ryan Serhant: which is like short form staging, short form design,
[00:18:00] Ryan Serhant: short form, brokerage, stuff like that across accounts.
[00:18:03] Ryan Serhant: So we kind of cast from within our group.
[00:18:04] Ryan Serhant: But yeah, it was the first time I'd ever really said,
[00:18:06] Ryan Serhant: I need to find 10 people.
[00:18:09] Ryan Serhant: Because it's all about the people.
[00:18:10] Ryan Serhant: It's all about the cast.
[00:18:11] Ryan Serhant: Like if the cast isn't there, then the show doesn't work.
[00:18:14] Yeah, and you need a mix of those personalities
[00:18:16] SPEAKER_02: so that they bounce off of each other.
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_02: And you have to have Arc.
[00:18:19] Ryan Serhant: And you have to have people who are willing to go 100%.
[00:18:22] Ryan Serhant: Like you can't put anyone in front of a camera
[00:18:24] Ryan Serhant: who's going to hold back and be nervous about what their mom's going to say.
[00:18:27] Ryan Serhant: Right? Like you have to be 100% open and talk about anything
[00:18:31] Ryan Serhant: and be willing to go the distance and just know that like we will protect you,
[00:18:36] Ryan Serhant: but you have to be willing to go out there.
[00:18:39] Ryan Serhant: And I think I think that's why the show work.
[00:18:40] Ryan Serhant: Because we spend a lot of time really thinking about the architecture
[00:18:44] Ryan Serhant: of that cast and about the structure of the show too.
[00:18:47] Ryan Serhant: Because we had to invent it from scratch.
[00:18:49] Ryan Serhant: Because I didn't want it to be selling sunset or a million dollar listing New York.
[00:18:52] Ryan Serhant: And selling sunset is basically a million dollar listing New York.
[00:18:54] Ryan Serhant: It's a lot of work meets housewives.
[00:18:55] Ryan Serhant: And it was created by the people who created a million dollar listing New York and housewives.
[00:18:59] Ryan Serhant: And so obviously, it's like, and I don't want it to be boring.
[00:19:02] Ryan Serhant: You can't be HGTV because that's dying.
[00:19:04] Ryan Serhant: What is the next generation going to want to watch?
[00:19:07] Ryan Serhant: I don't think they're just going to want to watch an apartment.
[00:19:09] Ryan Serhant: No one cares anymore.
[00:19:10] Ryan Serhant: We've seen it all.
[00:19:11] Ryan Serhant: And it's all now.
[00:19:12] Ryan Serhant: It's AI.
[00:19:12] Ryan Serhant: Like it doesn't matter.
[00:19:14] Ryan Serhant: So how can we, how can we give them something that I've ever seen before?
[00:19:17] Ryan Serhant: So I really wanted to redefine what the genre was for a doc you series.
[00:19:23] Ryan Serhant: And season two is very different.
[00:19:25] Ryan Serhant: It is a wild ride.
[00:19:27] Ryan Serhant: Spoilers, anything?
[00:19:29] Ryan Serhant: If you are looking for like dumb reality TV, unfortunately, that's not this.
[00:19:33] Ryan Serhant: It is, it takes the box for people that want to see real estate for sure.
[00:19:37] Ryan Serhant: But it's a deal show.
[00:19:39] Ryan Serhant: So for people who like deals, like you'd be like Shark Tank.
[00:19:42] Ryan Serhant: If you liked original million dollar listing, which was every episode,
[00:19:45] Ryan Serhant: we were actual deals and actual negotiations.
[00:19:47] Ryan Serhant: It is that.
[00:19:48] Ryan Serhant: It is high stress, high drama.
[00:19:50] Ryan Serhant: And I think continues to really redefine and blur the line between
[00:19:55] structured and unstructured TV.
[00:19:58] Ryan Serhant: Right?
[00:19:58] Ryan Serhant: Like following people who are at work and whatever happens is very unstructured.
[00:20:03] Succession is structured.
[00:20:06] And it's interesting.
[00:20:08] Ryan Serhant: It's hard for me to describe.
[00:20:09] Ryan Serhant: Like it's a, it's a, it's a fun watch because it is so unexpected.
[00:20:13] Ryan Serhant: That'll be interesting to see what you think when I force you to watch it.
[00:20:17] I don't think you have to force me.
[00:20:18] SPEAKER_02: I'll watch it.
[00:20:18] SPEAKER_02: You sure?
[00:20:21] The first season was really good.
[00:20:22] SPEAKER_02: I watched it when it first came out.
[00:20:24] SPEAKER_02: The second season.
[00:20:25] SPEAKER_02: I'll have my popcorn ready December 5th.
[00:20:27] SPEAKER_02: December 5th.
[00:20:28] SPEAKER_02: December 5th.
[00:20:28] SPEAKER_02: You should come from your party.
[00:20:28] SPEAKER_02: I invited Nicole.
[00:20:30] Ryan Serhant: She come December.
[00:20:31] Ryan Serhant: Okay.
[00:20:31] Ryan Serhant: Megan.
[00:20:32] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:20:32] SPEAKER_02: Well, Megan, Megan has come.
[00:20:34] SPEAKER_02: Well, I'll give you a plus one.
[00:20:36] SPEAKER_02: I'm doing it at a terminal five.
[00:20:39] Ryan Serhant: Maybe the biggest event I've ever done.
[00:20:42] Ryan Serhant: And it'll be completely insane.
[00:20:43] Ryan Serhant: You should come.
[00:20:44] Ryan Serhant: Can I podcast there?
[00:20:45] SPEAKER_02: Sure.
[00:20:46] Are we loud?
[00:20:47] Ryan Serhant: But sure, you do it every month.
[00:20:48] Ryan Serhant: Great.
[00:20:49] SPEAKER_02: Perfect.
[00:20:49] SPEAKER_02: Live stream it.
[00:20:50] Ryan Serhant: Go for it.
[00:20:51] Ryan Serhant: I'm going to be a streamer now.
[00:20:52] Ryan Serhant: I did this thing with I show speed.
[00:20:54] Ryan Serhant: You did.
[00:20:55] And I, I've never felt as old
[00:20:59] Ryan Serhant: and as least important in my whole life.
[00:21:02] Ryan Serhant: That guy can't walk.
[00:21:04] What?
[00:21:04] Because he's no, he has legs.
[00:21:06] Ryan Serhant: He can't walk because of the the amount of kids.
[00:21:09] Follow him.
[00:21:10] Ryan Serhant: They were trying to like, it was,
[00:21:12] Ryan Serhant: I've never experienced anything like that.
[00:21:14] Ryan Serhant: Like he just would go outside and Broadway shut down
[00:21:16] Ryan Serhant: because he's live streaming.
[00:21:17] Ryan Serhant: Yeah.
[00:21:18] Ryan Serhant: Everyone knows where he is.
[00:21:19] Ryan Serhant: At the exact moment, because there's no delay,
[00:21:21] Ryan Serhant: which is like for a security thing,
[00:21:22] Ryan Serhant: which is something that I was thinking about.
[00:21:23] Ryan Serhant: Like, I think he actually likes it.
[00:21:26] Ryan Serhant: You know, it's part of the,
[00:21:27] Ryan Serhant: it's part of the spectacle
[00:21:29] Ryan Serhant: that you could go and be on the live stream right now.
[00:21:31] Ryan Serhant: And so every kid around the country
[00:21:34] Ryan Serhant: just would figure out where he is and follow.
[00:21:36] Ryan Serhant: And it was mass and sanity.
[00:21:37] Ryan Serhant: I showed him a $40 million pen house in the Upper West Side.
[00:21:40] Ryan Serhant: And I've never had more people in a building mad at me.
[00:21:44] Ryan Serhant: Because they were like,
[00:21:45] Ryan Serhant: the building, the lobby,
[00:21:46] Ryan Serhant: these kids were trying to break in and try to get to him.
[00:21:49] Ryan Serhant: It was nuts.
[00:21:50] Ryan Serhant: And so anyway, moral of that story is,
[00:21:52] Ryan Serhant: I am going to become a streamer.
[00:21:55] Ryan Serhant: I think for sure,
[00:21:56] Ryan Serhant: I'm done with all the structured stuff
[00:21:58] Ryan Serhant: and like creating content and doing an actual CEO thing.
[00:22:01] Ryan Serhant: I think I should just stream.
[00:22:02] Ryan Serhant: Stream all day, 24 or 7.
[00:22:04] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he's like 22.
[00:22:05] Ryan Serhant: He makes $50 million a year.
[00:22:07] Ryan Serhant: What is the point of life?
[00:22:09] Like what do we all, what are we working so hard for?
[00:22:11] Ryan Serhant: Like you see that?
[00:22:12] Ryan Serhant: You're like, wait a minute.
[00:22:13] Ryan Serhant: Why don't I go to college?
[00:22:15] Ryan Serhant: I don't get it.
[00:22:15] Ryan Serhant: Well, that's why YouTube is like one of the top jobs that kids want.
[00:22:21] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:22:22] SPEAKER_02: Why cure cancer if you can make videos on the internet?
[00:22:26] Right?
[00:22:27] Ryan Serhant: Yeah.
[00:22:28] Like I, I mean, it's scary.
[00:22:30] Ryan Serhant: It is total, we are, we are, we are, it's over.
[00:22:34] Ryan Serhant: It's just all over.
[00:22:35] Ryan Serhant: Oh, no.
[00:22:37] Yeah.
[00:22:37] Yeah.
[00:22:38] Ryan Serhant: Because there's, there's, there's incentives are no longer aligned.
[00:22:42] It used to be, if you want to make a lot of money, you have to be a lawyer, a doctor,
[00:22:48] Ryan Serhant: a banker, a business owner, an entrepreneur, you have to employ others
[00:22:53] because you will delegate work.
[00:22:55] Ryan Serhant: You will buy their time for yours and you can grow.
[00:22:58] Ryan Serhant: So it used to be like that is how you can achieve economic prosperity is do one of those jobs.
[00:23:05] Ryan Serhant: You have to go to school and that was, that was, that was what was sold to us so that people
[00:23:09] Ryan Serhant: can take on debt.
[00:23:10] Ryan Serhant: Right?
[00:23:10] Ryan Serhant: So private markets, people take on debt and then the student loan fiasco was actually,
[00:23:16] Ryan Serhant: wasn't really a fiasco until Obama when they made a public.
[00:23:19] Ryan Serhant: So they made a, so now anybody can go get a student loan because we're going to make money on you.
[00:23:24] Ryan Serhant: We don't care if you go into debt because we'll just fix it later.
[00:23:27] Ryan Serhant: Right?
[00:23:27] Ryan Serhant: Anyway, that's a totally different topic.
[00:23:29] Ryan Serhant: But like I, I think like, okay, so the incentives are no longer aligned.
[00:23:34] Ryan Serhant: Right?
[00:23:34] Ryan Serhant: Same thing with like Obamacare.
[00:23:35] Ryan Serhant: So the incentives are no longer aligned for doctors and, and
[00:23:39] Ryan Serhant: so then why go do that?
[00:23:40] Ryan Serhant: It's also really, really hard.
[00:23:42] Ryan Serhant: Why not just do stuff on my phone?
[00:23:44] Ryan Serhant: Doesn't matter.
[00:23:45] Ryan Serhant: So it'll be interesting to see where we are in like 2100.
[00:23:48] Ryan Serhant: That'll be a crazy time.
[00:23:49] Ryan Serhant: Yeah, there's, there's a lot of different things to that.
[00:23:53] SPEAKER_02: One being AI and media are like entirely disrupting jobs and we'll get into the AI part in one second.
[00:23:59] SPEAKER_02: But to steal man that argument is experts are also becoming a very valuable,
[00:24:06] SPEAKER_02: a very valuable part of the AI journey and like hiring them.
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_02: One of our sponsors is churring and so they are an AI research and they're constantly trying
[00:24:16] SPEAKER_02: to hire more and more actual experts, people with PhDs, people that have gone and learned all
[00:24:21] SPEAKER_02: these things so that they can verify that the code that they're writing or whatever research
[00:24:25] SPEAKER_02: they're inputting into whatever model that's going to come out and chat to BT5 is like actually
[00:24:29] SPEAKER_02: Not just read it.
[00:24:30] SPEAKER_02: And not just, well, read it is actually one of like the largest training data sets.
[00:24:35] SPEAKER_02: I'm sure of it.
[00:24:36] Ryan Serhant: Is that great?
[00:24:37] Ryan Serhant: I don't know.
[00:24:37] Ryan Serhant: I don't know, but they're using it.
[00:24:40] And then on top of that, then they use the PhDs.
[00:24:42] SPEAKER_02: So there is room for PhDs and then if you look at meta strategy, they're giving like
[00:24:47] SPEAKER_02: billion dollar packages to people.
[00:24:49] SPEAKER_02: So you have like so many sides of the spectrum, you have these like
[00:24:53] SPEAKER_02: billion dollar packages for geniuses and then this recruiting talent of AI researchers and then
[00:24:58] SPEAKER_02: you have the rest of everyone who's trying to figure out like do I do YouTube?
[00:25:03] SPEAKER_02: Or do I do only fancy acts?
[00:25:04] SPEAKER_02: I do.
[00:25:05] Ryan Serhant: I do.
[00:25:06] Ryan Serhant: Yeah, that's what Danny does in his spare time.
[00:25:08] He eats bagels with his feet.
[00:25:09] Ryan Serhant: In today's high speed business world, staying ahead means using the smartest tools possible,
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_02: including the powerful capabilities of artificial intelligence,
[00:25:17] SPEAKER_02: meet Turing intelligence.
[00:25:19] SPEAKER_02: Turing builds customizable AI systems designed to solve your mission critical challenges
[00:25:23] SPEAKER_02: no matter your industry.
[00:25:24] SPEAKER_02: From expert guidance to tailored projects, Turing helps top companies realize AI that's more
[00:25:29] SPEAKER_02: capable, more adaptable and more effective.
[00:25:32] SPEAKER_02: With Turing, discover how AI can accelerate your business growth.
[00:25:36] SPEAKER_02: To learn more, visit Turing.com slash sorcery,
[00:25:40] SPEAKER_02: spelled S-O-U-R-C-E-R-Y.
[00:25:43] SPEAKER_02: That's Turing.com slash sorcery.
[00:25:45] SPEAKER_02: To shift over to the AI side, I want to get your opinion on this.
[00:25:49] SPEAKER_02: So you have done two things with AI.
[00:25:51] SPEAKER_02: You've infused it into the firm itself and then you've also created simple.
[00:25:55] SPEAKER_02: So one, how do you view AI disrupting real estate?
[00:26:00] I mean, that's such a huge open-ended question.
[00:26:02] Ryan Serhant: Yeah.
[00:26:03] Ryan Serhant: I'd say the easiest way for me to talk about it is starting with what we've created.
[00:26:07] Ryan Serhant: So we built something called simple,
[00:26:09] Ryan Serhant: which is an agent orchestration platform that uses MCP and Lang chain to coordinate
[00:26:16] Ryan Serhant: multi-model responses across a stack that we built to predict what a salesperson is going to do next.
[00:26:24] Ryan Serhant: That then uses function calling to perform automations.
[00:26:29] Our path is very different from the path.
[00:26:31] Ryan Serhant: It seems like everybody else has taken,
[00:26:34] Ryan Serhant: which is I'm not sprinkling AI or doing an enterprise deal into a system I've already built
[00:26:39] Ryan Serhant: just to make it better, faster, easier to use.
[00:26:41] Ryan Serhant: I don't need to do that.
[00:26:43] We are empowering the person to turn the person,
[00:26:47] Ryan Serhant: so for us, the salesperson into the platform.
[00:26:50] Ryan Serhant: And not just using AI to build a platform that people can use.
[00:26:54] So we've created what ends up being like an AI chief of staff for all sales people.
[00:26:59] Ryan Serhant: That anticipates all the work they're going to do and then does it for them.
[00:27:02] Ryan Serhant: So simple, replaces CRM,
[00:27:07] it replaces calendar, it replaces Canva, it replaces every single system a salesperson would use
[00:27:16] Ryan Serhant: in our industry to do their job because it does the work for them.
[00:27:19] Ryan Serhant: And it's all about the delivery.
[00:27:21] Ryan Serhant: All of our users, every SIR-HAND agent uses it.
[00:27:25] They call it Instacart for sales because they don't care where
[00:27:29] Ryan Serhant: the food's coming from. They just care that it's delivered and it's easy and it's fast.
[00:27:33] Ryan Serhant: I think it's very different than that.
[00:27:35] Ryan Serhant: I think it is an operating system for sales people that has created a world
[00:27:39] Ryan Serhant: where every individual person becomes two things.
[00:27:43] Ryan Serhant: The salesperson and their AI co-pilot, their partner, versus
[00:27:49] AI use AI to do my job.
[00:27:51] Ryan Serhant: Kind of like what you were saying before about me and the media company, etc.
[00:27:54] Ryan Serhant: Instead of just saying, hey, we're a real estate company that uses media and technology.
[00:27:59] Ryan Serhant: No, we are a media company that sells real estate.
[00:28:03] Ryan Serhant: The same thing for AI and it's completely changed the way we work and it's changed the way we
[00:28:09] Ryan Serhant: we play the game.
[00:28:10] Ryan Serhant: It's like, and maybe it's the exact wrong way to go about it, but so far so good.
[00:28:16] Ryan Serhant: And we've also taken the reason I mentioned, multimodalists like, I am not convinced which LLM
[00:28:22] Ryan Serhant: is correct or right.
[00:28:25] Ryan Serhant: I think there's a race towards refrigerant and I want to make sure that our users
[00:28:32] have the benefit of whichever one is right for the appropriate recipe that we're doing for them.
[00:28:37] Ryan Serhant: So like automating CRM work using AI to do that is really, really, really, really annoying
[00:28:44] Ryan Serhant: and it's really hard.
[00:28:46] Ryan Serhant: Claude is pretty great at it and Sonnet.
[00:28:49] Ryan Serhant: All right, a lot of the other administrative tasks, we can run a stack across like
[00:28:57] Ryan Serhant: Grock and GPT for example.
[00:28:59] Ryan Serhant: And then some other stuff has to be totally proprietary and totally custom.
[00:29:04] Ryan Serhant: And so that's what we built as as simple as I can kind of go through that.
[00:29:09] Ryan Serhant: We also use AI in every single department like all the classic stuff.
[00:29:13] Ryan Serhant: Like you can't hire a new person unless you prove to us that this thing cannot be done with AI.
[00:29:18] Ryan Serhant: And a lot of our managers now, instead of just being managers or middle managers,
[00:29:21] Ryan Serhant: they've almost become agent orchestration managers in their own right.
[00:29:26] Ryan Serhant: Like there's a company we work with now that helps us. We give them a JD,
[00:29:30] Ryan Serhant: they turn it into a gentick.
[00:29:32] Ryan Serhant: And it's not always great. A lot of it actually is pretty terrible, you know.
[00:29:37] Ryan Serhant: But some of it actually completely changes how we operate, especially when it comes down to like
[00:29:41] Ryan Serhant: finance, finance is a function underneath the level of strategy.
[00:29:46] Ryan Serhant: So just real computational stuff, design as a function,
[00:29:53] Ryan Serhant: so on and so forth. So we have AI across every single department. I think we are,
[00:29:58] it's for brokerage anyway, real estate brokerage and AI I think like we are now nationally known
[00:30:03] Ryan Serhant: for that or known for media. And it's really really exciting to see how we can empower
[00:30:09] Ryan Serhant: everybody using artificial intelligence. And I think that's the right way to think about it.
[00:30:13] Ryan Serhant: It's no longer tech enabled. It's AI empowered. And I'm excited to continue to build. It's fun.
[00:30:20] Have you played with any of the Gen AI video models?
[00:30:23] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we got access to Sora, the app with OpenAI way before it came out. So it was like me and Sam
[00:30:29] Ryan Serhant: Altman and all these other people at OpenAI only who are making the and Jake Paul randomly.
[00:30:35] Ryan Serhant: And making these random videos. And it's interesting. I think we will just like in TV,
[00:30:42] Ryan Serhant: right? You're going to have actual television movies. You have animated television movies.
[00:30:47] Ryan Serhant: And then you'll have AI. It'll just be a new piece of the pie. It'll eat into both of those.
[00:30:53] Ryan Serhant: But it'll also create a new piece of pie that'll empower the other two pieces. Because now everything
[00:30:59] Ryan Serhant: that's shot authentically is almost more important now. Because like, oh, you chose to use humans.
[00:31:06] Ryan Serhant: Holy. Let me watch this versus just using AI. And then AI is pretty fantastical. I've had the most
[00:31:14] Ryan Serhant: fun in just kind of creating historical moments. Thomas Jefferson signing the Louisiana purchase and
[00:31:21] Ryan Serhant: saying expansion always and always. Or if you have kids to sit there and with them and say,
[00:31:27] Ryan Serhant: instead of going and drawing, just come up with any idea. Let's do it. And then I'd have a six-year-old
[00:31:31] Ryan Serhant: daughter. And we, most of my Sora feed is her idea of just coming up with, no, okay, now we're
[00:31:38] Ryan Serhant: in a tree house. And then the tree house is a time machine. And then we become pirates. You put
[00:31:42] Ryan Serhant: that in a Sora. And it just makes it. And so now we can do that. I don't know to like, who's
[00:31:46] Ryan Serhant: benefit? Or like what the what the what it's really going to do for all of us. And I find myself not
[00:31:53] Ryan Serhant: really scrolling through Sora because it's just I just don't think it's there yet. And it's such
[00:31:57] Ryan Serhant: early early days. They're still in invite. But I'm poor all of it. To make this conversation more
[00:32:03] Ryan Serhant: tactical studios can now take a photo of a listing. Okay. And turn that into a full property
[00:32:11] Ryan Serhant: to or using AI with user disclaimer. But to give people enough of an idea so we don't have to do
[00:32:16] Ryan Serhant: virtual tours anymore. I don't have to show up with a photographer, a videographer, the way that we
[00:32:22] Ryan Serhant: used to do. You send thousands of dollars on. Exactly. Right. So it's like what industry are we
[00:32:26] Ryan Serhant: killing? And what dollars are we saving? And what time are we saving? One of the things simple
[00:32:30] Ryan Serhant: does so well. I know this mostly because we just did a lot of our like testimonials because the
[00:32:35] Ryan Serhant: Wall Street Journal is writing this in-depth article right now. I hope it turns out okay. Never
[00:32:40] Ryan Serhant: know these things. They always come in and they're positive. And then they're like Ryan sucks.
[00:32:46] Ryan Serhant: Is like how much time we're able to buy back. Like since January one of this year,
[00:32:54] Ryan Serhant: simple has completed over 12,000 automated tasks, which has saved 15,000 hours working human hours
[00:33:04] Ryan Serhant: for our people, which is like so over the chart that I ever would have expected us to be at.
[00:33:13] Ryan Serhant: It's insane because what ends up happening is people find new ways to work. So one of our agents,
[00:33:17] Ryan Serhant: she's a mom, her name is Abby. She's Brooklyn. She typically, when she's picking up her kid,
[00:33:24] Ryan Serhant: she goes, she wants to be a good mom. She goes and picks up her kid. She might have an assistant who's
[00:33:28] Ryan Serhant: doing some work for her. But like for her, you know what, it's just easier if I do it. These important
[00:33:32] Ryan Serhant: things. And so then she gets home and then she does it, takes two hours, then she cook dinner.
[00:33:37] Ryan Serhant: That's like just bend her no matter what. VA executive assistants, the greatest systems, whatever,
[00:33:43] Ryan Serhant: you still have to use them. So what happens if you tell somebody, guess what, you no longer have to use
[00:33:49] Ryan Serhant: you are now choice optional, you are now work optional, you're now screen optional. You don't have
[00:33:56] Ryan Serhant: to do anything. You just tell it what to do and it knows you already because of our onboarding process.
[00:34:01] Ryan Serhant: And it just gets delivered to you just like Instacart. So you don't have to run comps anymore,
[00:34:06] Ryan Serhant: set up listing presentations, set up buyer tours, do any of your personal brown, all the administrative
[00:34:10] Ryan Serhant: tasks that usually take up 80% of your day. Why not while you're waiting in the 15 seconds from your
[00:34:16] Ryan Serhant: daughter to exit school and get in your car. You just tell simple what you need done by the end of
[00:34:21] Ryan Serhant: the day. And by the time the door shots, it's all done. And it has like totally changed the way
[00:34:27] Ryan Serhant: that people operate. Chat GPT agent builder can't do that yet because it is incredibly specific and
[00:34:32] Ryan Serhant: you have to be a good prompt engineer. And salespeople just don't want to be prompt engineers.
[00:34:38] Ryan Serhant: I know I don't. So you talk about like Sora, the hardest thing I think for Sora and I show it to
[00:34:42] Ryan Serhant: people, I'm like, look what I created there, but how did you do that? Like, well, I told it, like,
[00:34:46] Ryan Serhant: but how did you know what to tell it? Like, well, I just, I don't know, I guess I just made it up
[00:34:50] Ryan Serhant: and invented it in my brain. I'm like, oh, I wouldn't even know what to do. And so people just want
[00:34:56] Ryan Serhant: to be told what what to do. I think AI is great. If you know what to tell it to do. And so that
[00:35:03] Ryan Serhant: anticipation engine that we've built in simple is and across all of our agentic employees is probably
[00:35:10] Ryan Serhant: the coolest thing to watch that it just knows the next step. And as long as you can manage the
[00:35:16] Ryan Serhant: initiative, it's pretty wild. Because you've made such a full stack real estate firm and you've
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_02: automated a lot of the services and you have agentic agents. Yeah. How has that changed the way
[00:35:27] SPEAKER_02: you recruit the average real estate agent in the United States is a 55 year old white woman.
[00:35:31] Ryan Serhant: Like a compass. I think it's like 57 at, you know, all the other firms that might be even a little
[00:35:36] Ryan Serhant: bit older, our average agent is 28. And they're all high production because they all operate mobile
[00:35:43] Ryan Serhant: first. Like we are a mobile first company, we're a digital first. And then we have some brick and
[00:35:49] Ryan Serhant: mortar and markets where we like legally we have to like a New York. I can't not have a spot.
[00:35:54] Ryan Serhant: And so we recruit agents who are attracted to selling anything to anyone on any device anywhere,
[00:36:00] Ryan Serhant: anytime and who believe in building their businesses empowered by our brand, our reach,
[00:36:10] Ryan Serhant: and our tech stack in a way that they just can't do elsewhere. There's a lot of firms that use tech.
[00:36:17] But then the agent or the employer, the consumer still has to use it. Like it's only as good as
[00:36:24] Ryan Serhant: the person who knows how to use the thing, right? Like my mom has a laptop. She still calls my CTO
[00:36:32] because it's her name on the door too to say words not doing the word thing.
[00:36:41] Ryan Serhant: But she has you simple and it's wild because it just and it can multi model 17 tasks at the same
[00:36:49] Ryan Serhant: exact time knowing exactly what to do as long as it's in the ecosystem. I have to ask because this is
[00:36:54] SPEAKER_02: an investing show. So you've raised $45 million for this about a year ago, it was just summer 2024.
[00:37:01] SPEAKER_02: You said you bootstrap this up until that point. This was a $45 million seed round. The median seed
[00:37:07] SPEAKER_02: round according to Carter is like $15 million for AI companies as of like early this year.
[00:37:11] SPEAKER_02: Yes. What was your process like for raising that capital and who did you raise from?
[00:37:16] I did it by myself like an idiot. I'm probably going to raise so much more. No, just kidding.
[00:37:21] Ryan Serhant: I had no it doesn't. It's a classic example of I had no intention of raising money. Like a bootstrapped
[00:37:30] Ryan Serhant: I have money. We're profitable. We're growing revenue, top line 80% year over year. Like we just are
[00:37:39] Ryan Serhant: my issue is not growth or agent growth or consumer growth. My issue is supporting the growth.
[00:37:46] Ryan Serhant: And so year four, like the supporting the growth thing was heavy and by myself. So hiring employees
[00:37:54] Ryan Serhant: who'd say who are your backers like my meat. You know, it's fine. But it's tough when you really
[00:38:01] Ryan Serhant: want to get the absolute best of the best. And even if I wanted to take on debt, for example,
[00:38:06] Ryan Serhant: which I don't we have no debt. But like I called JP Morgan one day. I was like, hey, so if I wanted
[00:38:12] Ryan Serhant: to just instead of spending $500,000 to do X today, like what's a what's a small business loan look
[00:38:17] Ryan Serhant: like? And they were like who are your backers like me? You have all my bank accounts. You see
[00:38:22] Ryan Serhant: everything and they're like, well, yeah, without without evaluation without backers, you could only do
[00:38:26] Ryan Serhant: X, Y. I'm like, but I don't get it. So we've had interest. We've had investor interest since the day
[00:38:33] Ryan Serhant: I launched in 2020 from P and VC and family office. I think because housing is recession resistant
[00:38:43] Ryan Serhant: when the market's up, people are trading when the market's down, people are trading.
[00:38:47] Right. And I think real estate doesn't go away. I think it just becomes more empowered and cleaner.
[00:38:51] Ryan Serhant: And all the other things we've talked about. And I just continued to take meetings as we got them.
[00:38:57] Ryan Serhant: And I met Jeff Berman at Canberra Creek a while ago. Actually on a reference call. Like he was calling
[00:39:03] Ryan Serhant: me about a system that we used. And I was like, yeah, systems fine. He's like, what are you doing?
[00:39:09] Ryan Serhant: I was like, I'm changing the world, man. And he was like, oh, really? And then we talked.
[00:39:15] Ryan Serhant: So I'll give you a cigarette. He and our co-investor, I guess the other biggest check was
[00:39:22] Ryan Serhant: left lane capital. So Harley Miller and those guys have left lane. Yeah, you would. And they
[00:39:30] Ryan Serhant: they're in the show. So season two, I've never seen this in a reality show. Season two is
[00:39:34] Ryan Serhant: we have VCs in a reality TV show. Yeah, it follows. Oh my god. The rays. What? It follows the
[00:39:41] Ryan Serhant: rays. And I thought Netflix was going to cut it. I thought they were going to cut it because it's
[00:39:45] Ryan Serhant: like it's not flipping tables and throwing drinks in each other's faces. This is amazing. But the
[00:39:50] SPEAKER_02: show is such an entrepreneurial roller coaster at a deal show with all the sexy glitzing
[00:39:56] Ryan Serhant: gland that you'd want. But it follows like Jeff Berman and Harley Miller in the show.
[00:40:02] Ryan Serhant: And it's intense. It is intense. And it beat me up on price. And like, what am I going to do?
[00:40:09] Ryan Serhant: And it's, I don't want to get too much away. But yeah, there are VCs and there's a VCC
[00:40:14] Ryan Serhant: rays that happens like live on camera in season two. We need to make VC mainstream.
[00:40:20] SPEAKER_02: I don't know if you do actually. But they're there. We already hit a bubble. Thanks to Tiger Global.
[00:40:27] SPEAKER_02: I'll call them out. I know they're back in market. So maybe we'll come on the pod. But
[00:40:33] SPEAKER_02: you know, we love VC. VC loves everybody. I love VCs. They buy the greatest houses.
[00:40:40] Ryan Serhant: And they sell the greatest houses. I'm all for it. They do. I go to a lot of events at different
[00:40:45] SPEAKER_02: and they are so competitive. They are very competitive. So everyone wants a better house.
[00:40:50] SPEAKER_02: I'm aware. I'm fully aware. Yes.

[00:41:40] SPEAKER_02: You do venture as well. What's the secret there? We will probably. There's a lot of things that
[00:41:46] Ryan Serhant: we're going to be rolling out in 2026. One of them is most likely venture arm. I've toyed around
[00:41:53] Ryan Serhant: with it now. We are super profitable. One of my issues every year is reinvesting profits.
[00:42:01] Ryan Serhant: We're to do with reinvesting profits. There's only so many locations I can open up in a day.
[00:42:05] Ryan Serhant: There's only so many engineers I want to hire to build. I really like the fact that our people
[00:42:12] Ryan Serhant: are really, really efficient. When you raise money, unless you have hard costs, like I'm raising
[00:42:17] Ryan Serhant: this money to build factories or build chips or whatever, typically you're raising money to do one
[00:42:22] Ryan Serhant: of two things. One is the people to do the stuff. You're paying people. Maybe some office space,
[00:42:28] etc. The other is distribution for the thing. People to do the thing and then distribution for the
[00:42:33] Ryan Serhant: thing. My thing that I'm building, I don't want to say replaces people, but makes the current people
[00:42:41] Ryan Serhant: so efficient they don't meet more people. I'm not really using dollars for people. My distribution
[00:42:46] Ryan Serhant: is bulletproof. It's just massive for us and for our product and what we do. We've played around
[00:42:53] Ryan Serhant: with a few things. I was mentioning before Realty Capital, which is real estate adjacent, but it's
[00:43:01] Ryan Serhant: payday loans for real estate agents around the country. It also does tax services, advisory,
[00:43:07] Ryan Serhant: all the other stuff, healthcare and all that. Then I also like blank street coffee. I like
[00:43:15] Ryan Serhant: update energy because they split the caffeine molecule and they have parisantine and you don't
[00:43:20] Ryan Serhant: have a crash from it. Why doesn't other people do this? What's too expensive to do? It's just
[00:43:24] Ryan Serhant: easier to get people caffeine. It's interesting. We have that. We have major league pickleball. We have
[00:43:31] Ryan Serhant: a lot of other things. There's a new vitamin company that just started shipping last week called
[00:43:36] Ryan Serhant: Per Day, P-E-R-D-A-E. Nilo is the founder and super fun. Then I find ways to interact with our
[00:43:44] Ryan Serhant: world. Whether I put products on Netflix or we put them across our socials and spike sales that
[00:43:49] Ryan Serhant: way or we have our annual conferences where we have thousands of salespeople show up and everyone
[00:43:54] Ryan Serhant: gets per day in a bag. It works. Ryan, how do you do all this? Danny here who's been
[00:44:02] Ryan Serhant: us phone the whole time, he's basically just running everything in the background.
[00:44:06] Really? No. I have a good team. I know what I'm good at and I know what I'm bad at. I'm a great leader,
[00:44:14] Ryan Serhant: I'm a terrible manager. Why try to manage? Why try to fit a square peg in a circular hole?
[00:44:20] Ryan Serhant: I brand, I expand and I sell. I do those three things all day, every day, mission vision purpose,
[00:44:27] Ryan Serhant: everything else is done by other people. They either do it in a way that I like or they don't get
[00:44:34] Ryan Serhant: to do it anymore. I don't know, life is short. I make sure to. Everyone I hire is an entrepreneur
[00:44:45] Ryan Serhant: meaning that they have an idea for how to do their role and they could do it as their own business
[00:44:51] Ryan Serhant: but they'd rather do it with me or with us and I give them that platform. So like sell it for example,
[00:45:00] Bonnie Sue Lovelace runs sell it. She is so insanely amazing. She could build her own edtech platform
[00:45:09] Ryan Serhant: on her own but we have the platform, we have the distribution and we have 40,000 users so
[00:45:14] Ryan Serhant: why not just do it with us right? Makes a lot of sense. Our director of ops, we're an AFAITs
[00:45:19] Ryan Serhant: Gerald. She could go and open any business nationally, scale it, put all the X's and all the O's in
[00:45:26] Ryan Serhant: the right spots and do it by herself but she can do it with us because we have the market, we have
[00:45:31] Ryan Serhant: the demand and I think it's really, really important to hire people that you're not just a little bit
[00:45:35] Ryan Serhant: scared of but that are real entrepreneurs. It's like my absolute best advice and then follow those
[00:45:41] four P's that I gave you a purpose people product. I'm going to ask an additional question for this.
[00:45:48] SPEAKER_02: Sure. So we're very proud, at least, sponsored by Brex and they're all about performance.
[00:45:53] SPEAKER_02: Okay. Sean Walsh from built. Yeah. He said that you schedule your day very particularly and you
[00:46:01] SPEAKER_02: have a specific eating window. Can you walk us through your day? Okay, I don't know why I have to attack
[00:46:07] Ryan Serhant: me right now. This has been such a nice podcast. I, I'm emotionally unavailable. Oh wait,
[00:46:16] Ryan Serhant: what's your question? I'm sorry if I know. I am a listen. I'm super scheduled Monday through
[00:46:23] Ryan Serhant: Friday. Maybe one day I'll get to be in a world where I have white space on my calendar and I can
[00:46:27] Ryan Serhant: just float through the office. I don't, I just like, I just know how to operate the way operate
[00:46:33] Ryan Serhant: and so I don't change it. So I have a thousand minutes every single day to be productive.
[00:46:38] Ryan Serhant: So I have a thousand minute rule. I wrote about that in book two and then Harvard Business School did
[00:46:43] Ryan Serhant: a review on it. So which I thought they were going to write about content or media or tech or AI
[00:46:48] Ryan Serhant: and they were like, no, this thousand minute rule is so weird. We're going to have you come and
[00:46:52] Ryan Serhant: teach a class and we're going to write and that's in like the Harvard Business Review book. It's so
[00:46:56] Ryan Serhant: crazy. But I have a thousand minute rule. I eat six hours a day. Am I feeding window? Why
[00:47:03] Ryan Serhant: he brings that up? Depends on the day. Today it is 1245 to 615. Tomorrow we'll see how the day
[00:47:13] Ryan Serhant: goes. But it's when I can metabol, this is so weird. I mean, this is such a weird conversation.
[00:47:18] Ryan Serhant: It's when I can metabolize the fastest and I think as you get older and you're 26, how do you?
[00:47:24] Ryan Serhant: 21. You're 21? No. Oh, however old you are. You'll see as you get older, your body just moves
[00:47:34] Ryan Serhant: a little bit slower and it's one of the ways that I can naturally sort of hack energy.
[00:47:40] Ryan Serhant: And then I schedule things on the 15 minute mark. So this is like, this is five blocks for me
[00:47:44] Ryan Serhant: because I had to get here 15 minutes before. I don't talk about that much because then people
[00:47:48] Ryan Serhant: think I'm weird. No, I don't think that's weird. Like I talk the tech community loves this stuff.
[00:47:54] SPEAKER_02: They want to hear about your biohacking rituals and how much you inner in fast and when you see
[00:47:59] SPEAKER_02: the sun during the day, that's what they want to hear. No. Do I see the sun? I don't know.
[00:48:06] Ryan Serhant: I do have a picture in the sun. Yeah, and it's got a sad face on it. Oh, do you want to talk about it?
[00:48:11] SPEAKER_02: Nope. On this podcast, that's a different podcast. Okay. All right. So I have a couple quick
[00:48:18] SPEAKER_02: questions as we wrap up. Sure. What happened to the $250 million listing that's
[00:48:24] pinned on your YouTube account? It's still there for 195. So you should sell it. I'll sell it. Yeah.
[00:48:33] Ryan Serhant: So it's a deal. You guys want it? It's a deal. You can't have it. No, you can't have it. What do you mean?
[00:48:38] Ryan Serhant: Just make an offer? Come to me. It's still there. It's great. We've had three offers on it.
[00:48:44] Ryan Serhant: All of them get turned down. Those properties are, you know, they're trophies and you don't auction them
[00:48:49] Ryan Serhant: like art. Right. So the right purchaser is there. And if they align with where the seller believes
[00:48:57] Ryan Serhant: the value is, then a deal gets done. There are too many super sized. I can't even say it. Super
[00:49:03] SPEAKER_02: skyscrapers. What do we call them? Super tall. Super tall skyscrapers. There's
[00:49:09] SPEAKER_02: less than 20 on planet earth. So if that's too many, I don't know. I know New York is a city built on
[00:49:18] Ryan Serhant: bedrock. So you can build them. New York is the most environmentally conscious city that exists
[00:49:26] Ryan Serhant: because we box ourselves like sardine cans and we buy into the air. You know where's not San
[00:49:34] Ryan Serhant: Francisco? Los Angeles? All of Texas? Because they say, why go up in the air? I just want your land.
[00:49:42] Ryan Serhant: And so I value myself worth by how much space I can take up. In New York, like I said, we didn't even
[00:49:51] Ryan Serhant: create space for trash. We put it on our front doorstep. Literally, it's on the sidewalk on the front
[00:49:58] Ryan Serhant: door that we walk over to try to get to work. And we are just fine with it. So New York in terms
[00:50:05] Ryan Serhant: of total greenhouse gas emissions is the most efficient and like led certified city there is.
[00:50:15] Ryan Serhant: And I think we'll remain that way. Like it is a tiny, tiny, tiny little island that we stick
[00:50:20] Ryan Serhant: 11 million people into at 2 p.m. on Tuesday. No, where else does that? There's other cities that have
[00:50:26] Ryan Serhant: millions of people, but no, they need to spread out, take up room. If you ever been in bed with someone
[00:50:31] Ryan Serhant: that likes to spread out, you're like, dude, give me the blanket back. It's uncomfortable and it's
[00:50:36] Ryan Serhant: annoying and they're selfish. New York City for the win. Do you think there should be speed limits
[00:50:43] SPEAKER_02: on super tall skyscrapers? In the elevators? There are speed limits. You can only like no elevator
[00:50:51] Ryan Serhant: is getting to terminal velocity. I don't know. Every time I go in those, I want to throw up.
[00:50:56] SPEAKER_02: Like they're very fast. I think that's a you problem. I think speed in elevators has everything
[00:51:04] Ryan Serhant: to do with what you call the stack effect. Like if you could get into an elevator and be at the
[00:51:08] Ryan Serhant: 100th floor in 10 seconds and not experience any shaker physical discomfort, you do it. Like
[00:51:15] Ryan Serhant: the same thing with the Concord airplane. Like I would love to go to London in two hours.
[00:51:20] Ryan Serhant: Not only is it unaffordable to do that, it is physically uncomfortable compared to the laps
[00:51:26] Ryan Serhant: of luxury we do on first class. Where you get to spread out, to put your legs down. People would
[00:51:32] Ryan Serhant: rather take six hours instead of doing two hours because they don't want to be cramped.
[00:51:37] Ryan Serhant: Same thing for an elevator. The stack effect in a super tall skyscraper is a tube. Within a tube.
[00:51:45] So you have this glass tube that sits on bedrock and inside you have these other glass tubes
[00:51:52] Ryan Serhant: where this physical thing is shoving air up and then shoving air down. And if you've ever tried to
[00:51:56] Ryan Serhant: like shove air, right, it can get stuck and you have a vacuum effect. But you call it the stack
[00:52:01] Ryan Serhant: effect because you have different air temperatures. So like in the winter, right, where it's really cold
[00:52:07] Ryan Serhant: outside, you have cold air attacking. Now this hot tube that is a thousand feet of glass and
[00:52:14] Ryan Serhant: concrete full of hot air because everyone's got the heat on. And then you go in the elevator bank
[00:52:18] Ryan Serhant: and it's not freezing cold like outside. But it's also not hot like you have in your apartment
[00:52:23] Ryan Serhant: because you're cold. So now you have this luke cold air being pushed by this fucking bullet
[00:52:30] Ryan Serhant: that's being attacked by the cold air from the outside and then it shakes. So at what speed can
[00:52:35] Ryan Serhant: you hit non-shake? That is the fastest an elevator is willing to go to where you don't experience
[00:52:41] Ryan Serhant: discomfort. And in some of them, you have break. So you go to one world trade, you get off it like
[00:52:46] Ryan Serhant: I think 66 and then you switch to another elevator because the stack effect would just be too
[00:52:50] Ryan Serhant: physically uncomfortable. Holy crap. I did not know you were an astrophysicist.
[00:52:56] Ryan Serhant: That's not the right engineering science for that one. It's an engineering thing, right? It's
[00:53:02] Ryan Serhant: mechanical engineering and plumbing. So it's MEP. So it's just engineering.
[00:53:06] Okay. I interview a lot of SpaceX alums and it seems like a SpaceX problem.
[00:53:11] SPEAKER_02: Does it? Yeah. Blue Arjun just asked me to come to space the other day. The DM'd.
[00:53:15] Ryan Serhant: Would you do it? No, how much was it?
[00:53:19] That's what they wrote back. That's it. That's like nothing. I sold a house to a guy that went
[00:53:24] Ryan Serhant: to outer space and paid for himself to go there. He really enjoyed it. But I think, I don't know,
[00:53:29] Ryan Serhant: my key man insurance might, I don't know, space is on there.
[00:53:35] Yeah. I have to see. Okay. Lastly, what's your favorite building in New York City?
[00:53:40] SPEAKER_02: My favorite building? Yeah.
[00:53:41] Ryan Serhant: Chrysler building. Why? Because it'll never be recreated. It is at work of art. It is an art
[00:53:47] Ryan Serhant: deco statue, right? Created by artists like back in the art deco period where you had architects
[00:53:55] Ryan Serhant: like Shreve, Lamb and Harmon who were doing buildings to impress people instead of just
[00:54:03] Ryan Serhant: filling space. Today, it's how can I go glass to glass and fill as many desk spaces as possible?
[00:54:10] Ryan Serhant: Or how can I create something that is beautiful? The Chrysler building is a fantastic
[00:54:17] Ryan Serhant: league or just building and no developer or builder in their right mind would ever, ever redo it.
[00:54:23] Ryan Serhant: Because it wouldn't make any sense today. You wouldn't be able to afford it.
[00:54:26] Well, now I need to ask, what are your opinions on the new JP Morgan building?
[00:54:30] SPEAKER_02: I'm obsessed. You're obsessed? Yeah. Because I think it brings
[00:54:34] Ryan Serhant: grade A office, so class A office, into a new world. Okay. They have nine private restaurants
[00:54:39] Ryan Serhant: for their own employees. You never have to leave. You want to work from home? Great. Your home is
[00:54:44] Ryan Serhant: here now. Like, it is just insane. You can fit up to 10,000 people in there during the day.
[00:54:50] Ryan Serhant: It is wild. Also, I love when they did that building, especially Mary Ann Lake, who was
[00:55:00] Ryan Serhant: CFO and has basically run that entire business under Jamie Dimon and she is a beast. You should
[00:55:05] Ryan Serhant: talk to her too. Or she just said, we're going to tear down the block. We're just going to build
[00:55:11] Ryan Serhant: a new one right on top of it. And fostering partners and everybody, it's so cool. I think now you're
[00:55:17] Ryan Serhant: going to have a class A office race. So now Ken Griffin, Verne, right? And those guys are going
[00:55:25] Ryan Serhant: to do park and I think it's 51st. They're just going to tear down all those buildings on 51st
[00:55:30] Ryan Serhant: and just build a brand new tower to compete with the likes of the new JP Morgan tower. I think what
[00:55:36] Ryan Serhant: it does though is it makes it really, really hard to be class B or class C office, which are all
[00:55:41] Ryan Serhant: going to turn residential for me. Good. Yeah. Exactly. Well, Ryan, it was a pleasure to have you
