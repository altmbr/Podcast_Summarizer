# How Ryan Serhant Sold $20B in Real Estate with Media & AI - Summary

## 1. Key Themes

### **Media as the Core Business Model, Not a Marketing Tool**
Ryan Serhant fundamentally reframed his company as a media technology company that sells real estate, rather than a real estate company using media. This wasn't just positioning—it changed everything from hiring to product development.

"Instead of a rebirth of an idea or a redirection of brand, it's just a reframe. When I started the company in 2020... I said, what is our real value problem? We can put properties in front of more qualified buyers globally, organically than any other firm combined... We are a media technology company that just so happens to sell real estate." [[00:06:02]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=5m52s)

This reframe enabled them to align purpose, people, and product before pursuing profit, creating a holding company structure with Studios, Sell It (training platform with 40,000 enrollees in 130 countries), and Simple (AI workflow service).

### **AI as Employee Replacement Through Anticipation, Not Just Augmentation**
Unlike companies adding AI features to existing systems, Serhant built an "agent orchestration platform" that turns salespeople into the platform itself. Simple anticipates what agents will do next and completes tasks automatically.

"Since January 1 of this year, Simple has completed over 12,000 automated tasks, which has saved 15,000 working human hours for our people... People find new ways to work. One of our agents, she's a mom... she no longer has to use [systems], you are now choice optional, you are now work optional, you're now screen optional." [[00:32:54]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=32m44s)

The system uses MCP and LangChain to coordinate multi-model responses, deliberately not committing to a single LLM: "I am not convinced which LLM is correct or right. I think there's a race towards [AGI] and I want to make sure that our users have the benefit of whichever one is right for the appropriate recipe." [[00:28:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=28m6s)

### **Vulnerability and Authenticity Over Winning Builds Community**
Serhant's approach to media focuses on losses, not wins, creating genuine connection with audiences that converts to business.

"Authenticity. First and foremost, vulnerability. People don't care about your wins. They want to connect with you on your losses. So I think we've been really, really clear by letting people know across all of our businesses and everything I do personally, my job is not to win my job is to lose. And I do that all day every day." [[00:08:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=8m14s)

He also warns against chasing virality: "I caution a lot of people on chasing virality, because if it's not an engaged customer, you don't know these people are... You're going to have a million views from where? Where? Who are these people?" [[00:09:27]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=9m17s)

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### **Hiring Rule: Only Entrepreneurs, Never Managers for Yourself**
Serhant explicitly hires people who could run their own businesses but choose his platform instead, and he refuses to manage them himself.

"I know what I'm good at and I know what I'm bad at. I'm a great leader, I'm a terrible manager. Why try to manage? Why try to fit a square peg in a circular hole? I brand, I expand and I sell. I do those three things all day, every day... Everyone I hire is an entrepreneur meaning that they have an idea for how to do their role and they could do it as their own business but they'd rather do it with me or with us and I give them that platform." [[00:44:14]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=44m4s)

### **You Cannot Hire New People Without Proving AI Can't Do It**
Before any new hire is approved, managers must demonstrate the role cannot be automated with AI, fundamentally inverting traditional hiring practices.

"You can't hire a new person unless you prove to us that this thing cannot be done with AI. And a lot of our managers now, instead of just being managers or middle managers, they've almost become agent orchestration managers in their own right." [[00:29:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=29m3s)

### **Bootstrap Until You Don't Need Money, Then Raise**
Serhant bootstrapped to profitability with 80% year-over-year revenue growth before raising $45M, doing it entirely himself without advisors because he had no urgent need for capital.

"I did it by myself like an idiot. I'm probably going to raise so much more. No, just kidding. I had no intention of raising money. Like a bootstrapped I have money. We're profitable. We're growing revenue, top line 80% year over year... My issue is not growth or agent growth or consumer growth. My issue is supporting the growth." [[00:37:21]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=37m11s)

When he tried to get a business loan from JP Morgan, they asked about his backers. His response: "You have all my bank accounts. You see everything." The lack of institutional backing limited even debt access despite profitability. [[00:38:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=38m2s)

### **Traditional Education Incentives Have Completely Broken**
Serhant argues the fundamental economic incentives for higher education and professional careers have collapsed, using I Show Speed as evidence.

After showing a property to I Show Speed: "He's like 22. He makes $50 million a year. What is the point of life? Like what do we all, what are we working so hard for?... Why don't I go to college? I don't get it... Incentives are no longer aligned. It used to be, if you want to make a lot of money, you have to be a lawyer, a doctor, a banker, a business owner... Why not just do stuff on my phone?" [[00:22:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=21m54s)

## 3. Companies Identified

### **Netflix**
Described as "the largest global distribution funnel on planet earth" with unique discovery mechanics compared to YouTube.

"It changed everything... You have 300 million people who get the choice of whether they want to click a button or not... Traffic increased like 24,100%. Or something completely insane... It was hundreds of thousands a day [in social following]... It is the largest global distribution funnel on planet earth, right? Like you just can't, like YouTube is huge. But you have to know what you're looking for on YouTube." [[00:14:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=14m45s)

After Owning Manhattan launched, the company website crashed from traffic, and they received 100 agent recruits per minute at peak. [[00:14:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=14m45s)

### **Left Lane Capital (Investor)**
Co-led Serhant's $45M seed round and appears in Season 2 of Owning Manhattan—apparently the first time VCs have been featured in a reality TV show.

"The other biggest check was left lane capital. So Harley Miller and those guys have left lane... They're in the show. So season two, I've never seen this in a reality show. Season two is we have VCs in a reality TV show... It follows the raise. And I thought Netflix was going to cut it... There are VCs and there's a VC raise that happens like live on camera in season two." [[00:39:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=39m20s)

### **Canberro Creek (Investor)**
Led by Jeff Berman, co-invested in the $45M round. The relationship began through a reference call.

"I met Jeff Berman at Canberro Creek a while ago. Actually on a reference call. Like he was calling me about a system that we used. And I was like, yeah, systems fine. He's like, what are you doing? I was like, I'm changing the world, man." [[00:39:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=38m53s)

### **Realty Capital**
Investment focus for Serhant: "Real estate adjacent, but it's payday loans for real estate agents around the country. It also does tax services, advisory, all the other stuff, healthcare and all that." [[00:43:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=42m51s)

### **Blank Street Coffee**
Portfolio investment mentioned alongside other consumer investments. [[00:43:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=43m3s)

### **Update Energy**
Investment in energy drink technology: "They split the caffeine molecule and they have paraxanthine and you don't have a crash from it. Why doesn't other people do this? What's too expensive to do? It's just easier to get people caffeine." [[00:43:15]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=43m5s)

### **Per Day (P-E-R-D-A-E)**
New vitamin company that just launched: "Nilo is the founder and super fun. Then I find ways to interact with our world. Whether I put products on Netflix or we put them across our socials and spike sales that way or we have our annual conferences where we have thousands of salespeople show up and everyone gets per day in a bag." [[00:43:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=43m26s)

## 4. Operating Insights

### **The Four P's Framework: Purpose → People → Product → Profit**
Serhant's framework for building companies prioritizes alignment before monetization.

"When we said that [we're a media tech company], we then aligned on a singular purpose. Right. And so then our purpose can inform the people that we get to hire. And then the people get to inform the product that we get to sell... If you have all three lined up, right, the purpose, the people in the product, then you can get to profit. So focused on the money last and it's worked so far." [[00:07:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=7m26s)

### **The 1,000 Minute Rule**
Serhant operates on 15-minute scheduling blocks with 1,000 productive minutes daily (Harvard Business School studied and published this approach).

"I have a thousand minutes every single day to be productive. So I have a thousand minute rule. I wrote about that in book two and then Harvard Business School did a review on it. So which I thought they were going to write about content or media or tech or AI and they were like, no, this thousand minute rule is so weird. We're going to have you come and teach a class." [[00:46:38]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=46m28s)

He schedules everything in 15-minute blocks: "This is like, this is five blocks for me because I had to get here 15 minutes before." [[00:47:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=47m34s)

### **Casting Reality TV Like Building a Company: Arc and 100% Commitment Required**
Spent a year casting Owning Manhattan, requiring people willing to be completely vulnerable on camera.

"If the cast isn't there, then the show doesn't work... You have to have people who are willing to go 100%. Like you can't put anyone in front of a camera who's going to hold back and be nervous about what their mom's going to say. Right? Like you have to be 100% open and talk about anything and be willing to go the distance." [[00:18:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=18m8s)

### **Recruit Younger to Match Product Philosophy**
Demographics reflect company strategy: "The average real estate agent in the United States is a 55 year old white woman. Like a compass. I think it's like 57... our average agent is 28. And they're all high production because they all operate mobile first." [[00:35:31]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=35m21s)

## 5. Overlooked Insights

### **The New Class A Office Arms Race Will Convert B and C to Residential**
While discussing JP Morgan's new building with nine private restaurants for employees, Serhant casually revealed a massive coming shift in commercial real estate.

"I'm obsessed... They have nine private restaurants for their own employees. You never have to leave. You want to work from home? Great. Your home is here now... I think now you're going to have a class A office race. So now Ken Griffin, Verne, right? And those guys are going to do park and I think it's 51st. They're just going to tear down all those buildings on 51st and just build a brand new tower to compete with the likes of the new JP Morgan tower. I think what it does though is it makes it really, really hard to be class B or class C office, which are all going to turn residential for me." [[00:54:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=54m20s)

This suggests a major investment thesis: Class A office will become ultra-premium corporate campuses, while the middle market converts to residential, creating a bifurcated market with massive repositioning opportunities.

### **New York City as the Most Environmentally Efficient Model Because of Density**
In defending super-tall buildings, Serhant articulated why vertical density is actually the greenest development pattern.

"New York is the most environmentally conscious city that exists because we box ourselves like sardine cans and we buy into the air. You know where's not San Francisco? Los Angeles? All of Texas? Because they say, why go up in the air? I just want your land... New York in terms of total greenhouse gas emissions is the most efficient and like LEED certified city there is." [[00:49:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Nvc0-IpxM&t=49m8s)

This challenges the conventional wisdom that sprawling development is more sustainable and suggests vertical urban density is the actual climate solution—a critical insight for real estate development strategy in an ESG-focused investment environment.
