[00:00:00] or philosophy at Pride that Josh taught me is that the people who win deals or the people
[00:00:04] Philip: who want to win deals the most.
[00:00:16] Philip, welcome to Sorcery.
[00:00:17] Molly O'Shea: Thanks for having me.
[00:00:18] Philip: This is a very big day.
[00:00:20] Molly O'Shea: We have a very stealth private fund here.
[00:00:23] Molly O'Shea: Okay, so you've been at Thrive for the past three years.
[00:00:26] Molly O'Shea: You joined there in 2022.
[00:00:28] Molly O'Shea: Yeah.
[00:00:28] Molly O'Shea: And since then, you've been involved in some of pretty incredible, some pretty incredible
[00:00:33] Molly O'Shea: investments like OpenAI, Curcer, Wiz, Nudge and Physical Intelligence.
[00:00:38] Molly O'Shea: How did you get to Thrive?
[00:00:40] Yeah.
[00:00:41] Philip: I think at the end of the day, I'm just a technologist and optimist.
[00:00:44] Philip: I have always really wanted to study and be like the people who worked on really big
[00:00:50] Philip: technology products and projects that bent history in the right direction.
[00:00:54] Philip: There was a kid my heroes were often heimer working on the Manhattan Project
[00:00:58] Philip: or Claude Shannon working at Bell Labs or Elon Musk, you know, starting SpaceX when
[00:01:04] Philip: I was four or five years old.
[00:01:06] Philip: And I actually went to school originally to study physics.
[00:01:09] Philip: I really thought that was the right way, sort of in the mold of some of those earlier
[00:01:12] Philip: figures of thinking about the hardest problems in technology.
[00:01:16] Philip: Now, truth is, I was pretty good at physics.
[00:01:19] Philip: I probably wasn't quite good enough.
[00:01:21] Philip: And the road to making impact on physics problems that are open in the field very, very long
[00:01:27] Philip: and switching to a more pragmatic route, which was studying computer science.
[00:01:32] Philip: And even so, really always inspired by this idea of technology being the right engine
[00:01:37] Philip: of history.
[00:01:39] Philip: And I think after spending a lot of time thinking about having an impact there, there are
[00:01:42] Philip: kind of two big options today.
[00:01:44] Philip: If you want to actually be part of that technological engine, one is you can go start a generational
[00:01:50] Philip: technology company to be perfectly honest.
[00:01:52] Philip: I didn't have any really great ideas of how to do that coming out of school.
[00:01:56] Philip: Or the second is you can be a partner to these sorts of companies and help them make
[00:02:01] Philip: the really important decisions.
[00:02:02] Philip: And so over time, it came pretty clear that the second was the path that I wanted to
[00:02:07] Philip: take and thrive seemed like a really exciting place to do it.
[00:02:10] Philip: I think Jeff Bezos had the same problem.
[00:02:12] Molly O'Shea: He wasn't like to do physics.
[00:02:13] Molly O'Shea: Yeah, he actually tried to do math and then physics and then he had quantitative.
[00:02:18] Molly O'Shea: So how did you meet thrive?
[00:02:20] Yes.
[00:02:21] Philip: A little bit of a funny story here.
[00:02:23] Philip: So to the point of being a amateur physicist at one point, I was really into semiconductors.
[00:02:29] Philip: I think they're one of the great examples of applied physics in the world.
[00:02:33] Philip: And we literally have machines that zap plasma with lasers twice in order to imprint patterns
[00:02:39] Philip: on semiconductor dye.
[00:02:41] Philip: And so I used to maintain a little substack about semiconductors.
[00:02:45] Philip: And my now partner, Josh, who started thrive back in the 2010s was really interested
[00:02:51] Philip: in 2021, 2022, about the idea of reshoring semiconductor manufacturing to America.
[00:02:57] Philip: And these days, I think almost all of advanced semiconductor manufacturing happens in
[00:03:02] Philip: Korea and Taiwan.
[00:03:03] Philip: This actually is a big change from history back in the 1990s, about 40% of semiconductor
[00:03:10] Philip: manufacturing happened in the US.
[00:03:12] Philip: Today, it's something like 10%.
[00:03:13] Philip: So drastic decrease.
[00:03:14] Philip: And as you know, and I'm sure as all your viewers know, these are probably the single
[00:03:19] Philip: most important inputs to all information technology, whether they be computers or
[00:03:23] Philip: artificial intelligence or what have you.
[00:03:26] Philip: So big question of, is there a way to America to be a major producer of these things again?
[00:03:31] Philip: Josh was exploring this and came across my substack because a former colleague at Bridgewater
[00:03:36] Philip: where I worked before 8vc was at thrive at the time.
[00:03:40] Philip: And he got in touch and we started talking about semiconductors and all.
[00:03:44] Philip: Spare you all the gory details, but turns out it's very difficult to reshor semiconductor
[00:03:48] Philip: manufacturing or at least would require a little bit more money than thrive had available
[00:03:53] Philip: at the time.
[00:03:54] Philip: But there was something where I had the reaction of someone with the boldness and ambition
[00:04:00] Philip: to think about an idea as important as that.
[00:04:02] Philip: Well, if you go back to great technology, just working on great technology projects, that
[00:04:06] Philip: felt really unique and distinct.
[00:04:08] Philip: And so I just became clear that I wanted to move from being in sort of quantitative trading
[00:04:12] Philip: hedge fund world to actually investing in early stage and fast growing technology companies.
[00:04:19] Philip: I went to Joshua Advice and knew what they say asked for advice, get a job and now I'm
[00:04:24] Philip: at thrive.
[00:04:25] Simple as that.
[00:04:27] Molly O'Shea: Make a substack.
[00:04:28] Make a substack.
[00:04:29] Philip: So no investments in semis?
[00:04:33] Not yet.
[00:04:34] Philip: We are investors in a company called Mesh Optical, which is in the data center.
[00:04:39] Philip: So if you think about the great AI CapEx build out happening right now, hundreds of billions
[00:04:44] Philip: of dollars being spent each year on building out new data center capacity to train the latest
[00:04:49] Philip: generation of AI models within a data center, there are few important components.
[00:04:55] Philip: There is the semiconductors themselves in video as a foreign half trillion dollar company.
[00:05:00] Philip: It's a result of being the greatest semiconductor designer in the world.
[00:05:03] Philip: There are also a lot of other technological components.
[00:05:06] Philip: One of these is called the interconnect, which is what moves data from one point to data
[00:05:10] Philip: center to another.
[00:05:12] Philip: Mesh is para founders from SpaceX, named Travis and Cameron, who actually knew back from
[00:05:18] Philip: college and then went to work on the Starlink photonics team.
[00:05:22] Philip: So the team that uses lasers in space to pass data from one satellite to another to give
[00:05:27] Philip: us internet.
[00:05:29] Philip: And they are bringing that innovation to the interconnect space in data centers.
[00:05:33] Philip: So we let the seed for that company at the beginning of this year.
[00:05:37] Philip: So that's where we've invested in data centers thus far, no chip companies thus far.
[00:05:41] Philip: Okay.
[00:05:42] Molly O'Shea: All right.
[00:05:43] Molly O'Shea: Well, we'll cover the whole stack because I definitely want to get your take on where
[00:05:46] Molly O'Shea: the value accrues in AI.
[00:05:48] Molly O'Shea: But before we get there, let's talk about your portfolio and your thesis around that.
[00:05:53] Molly O'Shea: So what companies are in your portfolio and what board positions you have?
[00:05:57] Molly O'Shea: Totally.
[00:05:58] Molly O'Shea: I'm pretty lucky to work with a few really, really exciting companies.
[00:06:02] Philip: I think one of the great privileges of this job is that you don't just get to work on
[00:06:06] Philip: one really exciting problem.
[00:06:08] Philip: You have to work on a few with several founders of the potential or are generational.
[00:06:13] Philip: And few companies that I work very closely with cursor, automating a lot of the drudgery
[00:06:19] Philip: associated with coding and being the ultimate AI pair programmer for a lot of developers.
[00:06:24] Philip: Think when we invested, there were a couple tens of thousands of users and low single
[00:06:30] Philip: digits million AR fast forward to today.
[00:06:33] Philip: I don't think the company publicly publishes revenue but called on the many, many hundreds
[00:06:36] Philip: of millions of run rate revenue and many millions of developers using the product.
[00:06:41] Philip: And that has just been an incredible growth story in the span of just 18 months.
[00:06:44] Philip: I think one of the really wild and exciting things about the AI are is that the timelines
[00:06:49] Philip: are getting compressed in a really radical way.
[00:06:53] Philip: I had the privilege of speaking to Michael Dell actually a few weeks ago and it's one
[00:06:57] Philip: of the great CEOs out there who is lived through both the internet era and the AI era.
[00:07:01] Philip: I am played a big role in each.
[00:07:02] Philip: I asked him how he thought about the difference between these two and his line to me was
[00:07:06] Philip: in some ways feel very similar in magnitude of impact.
[00:07:10] Philip: But whereas the internet era was like playing chess, the AI is like playing speed chess.
[00:07:15] Philip: And I think that's what we're starting to see with those companies and cursor, founders
[00:07:18] Philip: there of some of the greatest technologists I've ever worked with.
[00:07:21] Philip: And really exciting to see them change.
[00:07:23] Philip: An entire discipline way of work is done in a small, small window of time.
[00:07:28] Philip: Work very closely with a company called Wiz, which does cloud security.
[00:07:33] Philip: If you think about the internet created the first vulnerabilities of web technology,
[00:07:39] Philip: you could actually access documents and files and servers to the open internet.
[00:07:43] Philip: So we got firewalls.
[00:07:45] Philip: The next wave of information technology was the cloud.
[00:07:48] Philip: So we moved all of our software workloads to the likes of AWS and GCP and Azure.
[00:07:54] Philip: But in doing so, we created a lot of net new ways in which software could be accessed
[00:07:58] Philip: and be made vulnerable.
[00:08:00] Philip: And Wiz was started in 2020 with the goal of securing cloud software for the world
[00:08:05] Philip: as started by a really incredible team of Israeli entrepreneurs,
[00:08:10] Philip: a soft, Roy, you know,
[00:08:13] Philip: Ami, all who had actually worked on this problem for a little while earlier,
[00:08:18] Philip: but acquired by Microsoft, built out the cloud security business at Microsoft,
[00:08:22] Philip: and then built Wiz.
[00:08:23] Philip: Another sort of amazing success story in a very short amount of time.
[00:08:27] Philip: And Google announced that acquisition of that company back early this year.
[00:08:31] Philip: For I think it was the largest sum a startup has ever been applied for.
[00:08:36] Philip: So another really exciting one.
[00:08:38] Philip: We talk about open AI or physical intelligence or Nudra others as well.
[00:08:41] Philip: But those are a few that I've had to privilege of being close partners to founders for.
[00:08:46] Philip: So cursor is super hot right now.
[00:08:48] Molly O'Shea: If you didn't know that.
[00:08:49] Molly O'Shea: Yeah, it's news to me.
[00:08:51] I'd love to know how did you meet Michael and their team?
[00:08:54] Molly O'Shea: Yeah.
[00:08:55] Philip: So Michael actually met when he was working on a different idea.
[00:09:00] Philip: This is I think one of the great lessons that we're really stage investing is ideas change a lot.
[00:09:05] Philip: People are really a constant that you want to be focused on.
[00:09:09] Philip: So I met Michael back in late 2022.
[00:09:12] Philip: He was actually working on tool for mechanical engineers at the time,
[00:09:17] Philip: trying to bring AI to what's called CAD or computer aided design.
[00:09:22] Philip: Actually the day I met him was the day he decided to pivot away from that idea.
[00:09:25] Philip: And so most of our conversation was not about any particular company,
[00:09:29] Philip: but about the list of possible pivots.
[00:09:31] Philip: I think my one helpful recommendation at the time was he was thinking about customer support.
[00:09:36] Philip: I recommended that he might find something related to software more enjoyable.
[00:09:41] Philip: My guess is I didn't actually have that much of an impact,
[00:09:43] Philip: but I'd like to think maybe a little bit of a nudge in the right direction.
[00:09:47] Philip: But even in that moment, I think with great founders,
[00:09:49] Philip: there's this almost electric energy you can sense in the first meeting.
[00:09:53] Philip: And shortly afterwards, Michael and Amon moved to San Francisco.
[00:09:57] Philip: They actually merged with another company where they got their other two co founders,
[00:10:01] Philip: while I in Arvid, and they started working on the first AI IDE integrated developer environment,
[00:10:07] Philip: which is sort of the text editor where coding happens.
[00:10:10] Philip: And when they put that out, I tried it and was an early user of the product.
[00:10:15] Philip: And it was definitely one of those magical one way door moments.
[00:10:19] Philip: Like once you walk through a door like that, you can't knock through a door like that.
[00:10:23] Philip: And so myself and my partner Miles spent the next year trying to see
[00:10:28] Philip: how we could ultimately partner with them and fast forward to May of 2024.
[00:10:32] Philip: We finally convinced them that we were the right sorts of people to bring on to the cap table.
[00:10:37] That's wild.
[00:10:37] And to the point of just I think like going hard at it,
[00:10:43] Molly O'Shea: you were cited at the colossus profile of flying into a war zone.
[00:10:48] Molly O'Shea: And this goes after the second company that you mentioned, Wiz.
[00:10:52] Molly O'Shea: So what was that like and tell us everything?
[00:10:56] Yes, it was it's definitely one of the more memorable moments of my career.
[00:11:01] Philip: I think it comes down to we are willing to do anything for our companies.
[00:11:06] Philip: And we want to show our companies that if we're going to be the right partner,
[00:11:09] Philip: they should know that we're willing to do anything.
[00:11:11] Philip: And so story with Wiz is I actually met them shortly after I joined Thrive for the first time.
[00:11:17] Philip: Actually, if you want a fun story, join Thrive.
[00:11:20] Philip: Josh had this really great idea of everyone at Thrive should go to its city outside of the core event.
[00:11:26] Philip: So not New York, not San Francisco and export for a couple of weeks.
[00:11:30] Philip: So I went to Tel Aviv.
[00:11:31] Philip: I've never been there in my life.
[00:11:32] Philip: And if you're in Tel Aviv in 2022, the talk of a town is this really
[00:11:36] Philip: buzzy, exciting new cybersecurity company with.
[00:11:38] Philip: And so I just spent two weeks trying to figure out what was the right way to meet this really cool company.
[00:11:44] Philip: Eventually, I got a meeting with a soft and Josh and I remember to this three way zoom
[00:11:49] Philip: where I was actually back in New York at the time, a soft was in Tel Aviv.
[00:11:52] Philip: Josh was in Tokyo at the time.
[00:11:55] Philip: So you were really spanning time zones.
[00:11:58] Philip: And to the point of electric founders, like I mentioned with Michael,
[00:12:01] Philip: it was immediately clear this was not your mom's security company.
[00:12:04] Philip: Very, very different.
[00:12:06] Philip: I think many great security companies in the world,
[00:12:09] Philip: they're often a little bit more sort of risk mitigating,
[00:12:12] Philip: you know, like say, cover your butt if you want to be a little bit risque about it.
[00:12:16] Philip: Wiz is not like that.
[00:12:17] Philip: It is a software infrastructure developer platform.
[00:12:20] Philip: I think one of the most shocking things I learned on that first call was that 50% of Wiz's users at the time
[00:12:25] Philip: were software developers, not security people.
[00:12:27] Philip: Very different than how security is traditionally done.
[00:12:31] Philip: And so I think we were pretty quickly sure of the fact that a soft was this wildly humble,
[00:12:38] Philip: but charismatic and brilliant founder.
[00:12:40] Philip: And he was working with three other co-founders who complemented him
[00:12:44] Philip: and incredible ways across product and technology and marketing.
[00:12:48] Philip: And this was among the most unique security products we had ever seen.
[00:12:52] Philip: So similar cursor wasn't like we were to check that day.
[00:12:56] Philip: Actually spent a year or so building a relationship with the company,
[00:13:00] Philip: trying to simulate acting like partners well ahead of actually being partners.
[00:13:04] Philip: So that's just sort of how we operate.
[00:13:06] Philip: And then we get to December of 2023, early January of 2024.
[00:13:13] Philip: A soft gives us a call and walks us through the latest numbers.
[00:13:16] Philip: And Josh and I look at each other and we realize we absolutely have to invest in the company.
[00:13:19] Philip: It's one of the most beautiful software businesses we've ever seen.
[00:13:22] Philip: Now the problem is the Israeli Gaza war is going on at the time.
[00:13:28] Philip: And it's not super easy to get into the country.
[00:13:30] Philip: And so by hook or by crook, we make our way to Tel Aviv in 12, 24 hours.
[00:13:35] Philip: We land a soft and generous enough to get dinner with us for four hours.
[00:13:40] Philip: And we talk about the future of the company and their ambitions.
[00:13:42] Philip: And again, immediately clear they're thinking about ways on a different level
[00:13:47] Philip: than trying to just build a tool.
[00:13:48] Philip: Really a different way to sort of build cloud software.
[00:13:51] Philip: And by the end of the dinner, we definitely want to invest.
[00:13:54] Philip: So handshake on a deal and we're lucky to be investors in the company.
[00:13:58] Philip: I definitely have a bunch of questions off of this.
[00:14:01] Molly O'Shea: But what was mentioned in the closet piece was that no other investor would fly there at the time.
[00:14:08] Molly O'Shea: So was this a highly competitive round and you felt you needed to go there to close the deal?
[00:14:14] Yeah, I think it's a great question.
[00:14:16] Philip: And I would frame it a little bit differently, which is certainly I think our philosophy at throught
[00:14:19] Philip: that Josh taught me is that the people who win deals or the people who want to win deals the most.
[00:14:24] Philip: And so we always have a leave it all in the field mentality.
[00:14:28] Philip: At the same time, when we're partnering with companies or we're discussing with companies
[00:14:32] Philip: whether we're the right partner, we don't really do it thinking about other players
[00:14:36] Philip: from the field. You play against yourself, you don't play against others.
[00:14:39] Philip: If our founders were going to be in Israel during what was a trying time, we wanted to be in Israel
[00:14:45] Philip: and show them that that mattered to us too.
[00:14:47] Philip: And so I think it was much more statement around the type supportner we wanted to be.
[00:14:52] Philip: The Wiz team versus the competitive sub the deal.
[00:14:55] Philip: And then walk me through diligence.
[00:14:57] Molly O'Shea: So you said that it had amazing numbers, but like what does that mean?
[00:15:01] Molly O'Shea: Yeah.
[00:15:02] Philip: So Wiz, I think exemplifies like one of the key things in enterprise software that I'm surprised
[00:15:07] Philip: not more people talk about, but oftentimes enterprise software, they're all the class of things
[00:15:12] Philip: you might care about, margins, retention, etc.
[00:15:15] Philip: Wiz looked, you know, 11 out of 10 across all these.
[00:15:18] Philip: I think they almost never turned one customer in the course of all the time between when they
[00:15:22] Philip: start the company and when we were looking at this round.
[00:15:25] Philip: And but a really special aspect of the business is often what is the size of the deals you
[00:15:31] Philip: can sell versus a speed at which you can sell deals.
[00:15:34] Philip: I actually think often looking at this ratio is a really, really powerful metric of basically
[00:15:39] Philip: how many dollars can you turn as a company and how quickly can you change your market?
[00:15:43] Philip: Wiz had, I think, the very best ratio of the all size to speed at implementation with
[00:15:49] Philip: almost any company that I've ever seen.
[00:15:51] Philip: And it makes total sense.
[00:15:52] Philip: Vera sales rep it was, you can get on a call with a customer.
[00:15:56] Philip: You could ask them for their cloud API keys.
[00:15:59] Philip: You can pull it into their side scanning product.
[00:16:02] Philip: They will scan your environment.
[00:16:04] Philip: They will give you a list within a few minutes of all the vulnerabilities you didn't know
[00:16:08] Philip: you had.
[00:16:09] Philip: And what customer is not going to look at those and say, oh my god, I have a bunch of vulnerabilities
[00:16:14] Philip: but I'm not going to buy the product that showed me the fact that I was super exposed.
[00:16:18] Philip: And so Wiz was closing on these like very healthy six figure deals in a matter of weeks
[00:16:24] Philip: or months, which was just unprecedented.
[00:16:26] Philip: And normally you have small deals and fast cycles, you have big deals and slow cycles.
[00:16:31] Philip: Wiz had more or less figured out how to actually cut the gourdian knot and get both.
[00:16:34] Philip: So that felt really special.
[00:16:36] Philip: I think the second was I mentioned this developer population on the platform.
[00:16:40] Philip: It actually felt more like a software infrastructure tool, like a data dog or a cloud flare or
[00:16:46] Philip: the like the nutritional security tool wasn't a check the box compliance workflow.
[00:16:50] Philip: It was actually how do you surface issues to engineering teams provide them with a context
[00:16:56] Philip: to fix those issues and then remediate them.
[00:16:58] Philip: And that felt very unique and special too.
[00:17:01] Philip: And I think finally, most products like to say their platforms, very few products are
[00:17:06] Philip: actually platforms.
[00:17:08] Philip: Wiz was actually a platform.
[00:17:09] Philip: If you looked at the number of products that were being adopted across different areas
[00:17:14] Philip: of the stack, they had code security on the left hand side of the stack.
[00:17:18] Philip: They had cloud infrastructure security in the middle of the stack.
[00:17:21] Philip: They had runtime security.
[00:17:23] Philip: So actually looking at the live software workloads running on the platform and seeing all
[00:17:27] Philip: three of those getting really healthy adoption rates and end to end way for a company that
[00:17:32] Philip: was barely four years old at the time, that was really, really unique.
[00:17:36] Philip: Cheeling gave us a lot of confidence that the company is going to have not just an act
[00:17:40] Philip: to but probably an act three and four as well.
[00:17:43] Philip: And I think the mark of a lot of great companies is that their first product gives you the
[00:17:47] Philip: right to go to you and build some really exciting second and third products.
[00:17:51] Philip: So these are both software companies, but I've heard you might be the hardware guy on
[00:17:55] Molly O'Shea: the team.
[00:17:56] Molly O'Shea: I do have that reputation a little bit.
[00:17:58] Philip: Why?
[00:17:59] Philip: Physicists.
[00:18:00] Philip: Yeah, when you're growing up as a physicist, like you really come to appreciate hardware
[00:18:05] Philip: and like tinker around with it.
[00:18:07] Philip: I also think if you're a technologist and optimist in this moment, you barriers to entry to hardware
[00:18:13] Philip: are coming down a lot.
[00:18:15] Philip: Okay.
[00:18:16] Philip: In PCOS, we're getting a lot cheaper.
[00:18:18] Philip: In these days, lighter costs are a couple hundred dollars a sensor back in 2014.
[00:18:22] Philip: So barely 10 years ago, there was something like $75,000, $80,000 a sensor.
[00:18:26] Philip: So while decrease software is making a lot easier to build hardware tool.
[00:18:31] Philip: I mean, you live in San Francisco.
[00:18:32] Philip: We have self driving cars that I think increasingly outnumber the number of human driving
[00:18:37] Philip: cars in the streets.
[00:18:38] Philip: So we just build a lot more interesting things with the software intelligence layer than
[00:18:42] Philip: we used to be able to do.
[00:18:44] And then in addition, there is a generation of founders that have been trained at the
[00:18:48] Philip: first wave of really great technology companies.
[00:18:51] Philip: You know, if you were Elon starting SpaceX in the early 2000s or Palmer and Brian and
[00:18:58] Philip: Tray and that starting a androle in the late 2010s, there wasn't actually a huge population
[00:19:06] Philip: of pre-existing startup hardware train talent to go drawn.
[00:19:10] Philip: So they did amazing work security was them and built really important businesses.
[00:19:14] Philip: The nice thing today is that those companies have now trained a lot of really amazing engineers
[00:19:19] Philip: that know what it mean to build software and hardware technology that can scale to very,
[00:19:25] Philip: very high volumes.
[00:19:27] Philip: And those founders can now look at these host of new problems that are available to them
[00:19:32] Philip: because of the changes that have happened in technology and go chase them.
[00:19:36] Philip: And so I think as an investor and someone who's really excited about companies that can
[00:19:40] Philip: counter factually impact the world, that can make the world look physically different in
[00:19:44] Philip: some meaningful way, the number of opportunities now in hardware are far greater than they've
[00:19:49] Philip: been at any time of the last 20 years.
[00:19:51] Philip: I think you were cited and we talked about this before, but you were cited that you wanted
[00:19:57] Molly O'Shea: to become the CEO of Lockheed Martin.
[00:20:00] When I was a kid, this was a childhood dream.
[00:20:03] Philip: Now, not still a childhood dream.
[00:20:05] Philip: I think you, I was born in the very late 1990s and then there was no space sex or there
[00:20:10] Philip: was no andro, there was no Tesla.
[00:20:12] Philip: So you were born today, I'd like to believe I'd like to be CEO of one of those companies,
[00:20:16] Philip: but at the time, if you're a hardware nerd and you're a physics nerd, what are the companies
[00:20:22] Philip: really excited about?
[00:20:23] Philip: The companies that take on really big technology projects and say what you will about Lockheed
[00:20:28] Philip: Martin, I think they did take on some of the most ambitious technology projects of 20th
[00:20:33] Philip: century, the SR71 Blackbird, large amounts of the stealth fighter program, large amounts
[00:20:39] Philip: of the missile program.
[00:20:40] Philip: And so I think really incredible technological accomplishments.
[00:20:44] Philip: And so probably what I really meant when I was early teens, young kid, thinking about
[00:20:50] Philip: that stuff is I just want to be in a place where I can push the envelope on how really great
[00:20:54] Philip: technology gets built.
[00:20:55] Philip: Who knows, maybe you'll take over Lockheed Martin and I don't know, I think I'm CEO.
[00:21:00] Molly O'Shea: One day.

[00:23:26] Molly O'Shea: It's interesting because you do build software, you do hardware.
[00:23:30] Molly O'Shea: I want to talk about the revenue between the two, the different types, and then also
[00:23:33] Molly O'Shea: the business model.
[00:23:35] Molly O'Shea: How come you mentioned a little bit now, now the window for hardware investing is a little
[00:23:41] Molly O'Shea: bit more attractive, but on the business model side, can you break that down?
[00:23:45] Molly O'Shea: It's never been an attractive VC investment, so why is it attractive now?
[00:23:49] Molly O'Shea: All those people invest in the early stages of space, and then real, really regretting
[00:23:53] Philip: it, right?
[00:23:54] Molly O'Shea: They did a horrible job.
[00:23:56] Philip: I think you're pointing towards something, which is genuinely true, which is that hardware
[00:24:00] Philip: is definitely harder than software.
[00:24:03] Philip: It is harder because you actually have to build more product, it is harder because that
[00:24:07] Philip: product is more expensive to build.
[00:24:09] Philip: It's not like writing bits, which are more or less free.
[00:24:13] Philip: It is atoms, which cost money to put together.
[00:24:16] Philip: This is hard because there is often an operational aspect to hardware investing, where I don't
[00:24:21] Philip: just have to build a product and press a ship the binary button on a computer.
[00:24:25] Philip: I actually have to have a manufacturing line and a deployment line that gets the saddened
[00:24:28] Philip: to the real world.
[00:24:31] Philip: That said, I think hardware businesses can be enormously durable and attractive once you
[00:24:37] Philip: actually get them off the ground.
[00:24:39] Philip: It's really hard to imagine who is possibly going to disrupt SpaceX at this point, knock
[00:24:45] Philip: on wood, or what is going to be someone who could really go out and disrupt and roll.
[00:24:51] Philip: That's because I think when you get over the hump of these really, really hard industries
[00:24:55] Philip: and problems, you're actually have built something at scale that is very hard to quickly
[00:25:00] Philip: replicate.
[00:25:01] Philip: Whereas in software, not true for all businesses, but the barriers to building software are
[00:25:06] Philip: probably lower than ever before too.
[00:25:09] Philip: I think there is a dynamic here of yes, there are bigger fixed costs to getting hardware
[00:25:13] Philip: off the ground.
[00:25:14] Philip: But these businesses can be really unique and powerful once they do.
[00:25:18] Philip: They often actually have a very geometric growth rate to them.
[00:25:22] Philip: I was looking at the revenue curves actually of and roll and SpaceX and Tesla the other
[00:25:27] Philip: day.
[00:25:28] Philip: They are some of the only companies that actually accelerated growth at scale, which is to
[00:25:33] Philip: say they are growing at a faster rate at a multi-billion dollar scale than they were
[00:25:37] Philip: then were small.
[00:25:38] Philip: Normally in a technology company, you have a deterioration of growth every time.
[00:25:42] Philip: I think the difference is hardware is actually the bigger you get, the bigger markets you
[00:25:46] Philip: can access, and the more people trust you to take on big problems.
[00:25:49] Philip: Take a hand roll, for instance, when they were in a real estate company, they were really
[00:25:54] Philip: great about getting on the field.
[00:25:56] Philip: They won a program of record, which are the very big budget-minded in contracts in the
[00:26:02] Philip: National Defense Authorization Act within two years, fastest timelines since the Korean
[00:26:07] Philip: War.
[00:26:08] Philip: But those deals were good and they were only ordered of 10s or 100s of millions of dollars.
[00:26:12] Philip: Now, Andrews being tapped for many of the great technology programs that the US military
[00:26:19] Philip: is thinking about across all domains, from air to space to Navy, etc.
[00:26:25] Philip: Which means that the number of contracts are eligible for and the number of revenue
[00:26:28] Philip: they can go after is quite a bit larger.
[00:26:30] Philip: Again, I think actually expanding the aperture of what they could do or think SpaceX.
[00:26:36] Philip: For the first 15 years of the business, SpaceX was a launch business, great business.
[00:26:41] Philip: That's a free cash flow, only provider in the US, maybe the world that could bring
[00:26:45] Philip: mass into orbit at a competitive price point.
[00:26:48] Philip: I don't know if you know this, actually, before SpaceX, we had to rely on the Russians
[00:26:52] Philip: to bring people to the International Space Station.
[00:26:55] Philip: So good we can have an American company doing it now.
[00:26:58] Philip: But it created the opportunity for them to build Starlink, which is now one of the most
[00:27:04] Philip: powerful internet constellations in the world.
[00:27:06] Philip: And it's actually driving a very, very large majority of overall free cash flow and revenue
[00:27:10] Philip: for the business.
[00:27:12] Philip: And so again, I think these later age, second stage acts of hardware companies can
[00:27:17] Philip: up looking a lot bigger in the early stages.
[00:27:19] Philip: Which is a very distinct characteristic.
[00:27:21] Philip: That said, great business is a great business.
[00:27:23] Philip: And you do need to make sure that these things are still high margin, great products, great
[00:27:28] Philip: founders, etc.
[00:27:29] Philip: There certainly has been a surge of funding that's gone in this direction.
[00:27:33] Molly O'Shea: And there's also bottlenecks that come with it, whether it's policy, government, etc.
[00:27:39] Molly O'Shea: And different kinds of regulations.
[00:27:41] Molly O'Shea: So how do you see this current stage of hardware in the cycle?
[00:27:47] Molly O'Shea: Do you think that we were in a bubble?
[00:27:49] Molly O'Shea: Are we in a bubble?
[00:27:50] Molly O'Shea: Like what's the, like, I guess, temperature on the ground?
[00:27:53] Molly O'Shea: Yeah, I think the temperature on the ground is the returns always accrued with a small
[00:27:57] Philip: number of companies.
[00:27:58] Philip: Venture is the actual asset class with the worst beta and the best alpha of any financial
[00:28:04] Philip: asset class.
[00:28:05] Philip: Which is to say, you know, the best companies are going to give you the best possible return
[00:28:08] Philip: of any possible equity instrument you could invest in.
[00:28:12] Philip: And the index is probably going to give you pretty mediocre returns.
[00:28:15] Philip: I think hardware is going to look no different than that, which is to say, I am fairly confident
[00:28:20] Philip: that we are going to produce some of the world's most valuable companies in hardware over
[00:28:24] Philip: the next decade.
[00:28:25] Philip: Even right now, five of the 10 most valuable companies in the world are hardware companies.
[00:28:28] Philip: Apple and video, Broadcom Tesla, TSMC.
[00:28:32] Philip: At the same time, these businesses are hard.
[00:28:34] Philip: There aren't that many people who are really great at being combined hardware software
[00:28:38] Philip: thinkers.
[00:28:40] Philip: And so there's probably going to be a lot of companies that don't work.
[00:28:42] Philip: That's just the nature of a company building.
[00:28:45] Philip: But I think the really exciting thing, the types of companies we invest in are end of one
[00:28:49] Philip: founders.
[00:28:50] Philip: They like to camera into the Travis's or the Palmer's or, you know, also investors and
[00:28:55] Philip: duds, like you mentioned, Jeremy, who used to help run engineering at Nureline, Confed
[00:28:59] Philip: Urson, who was one of the co-founders of Coinbase.
[00:29:01] Philip: We're working on these very unique missions.
[00:29:05] Philip: I can't think of anyone else who is using a non-invasive ultrasound to stimulate brain activity
[00:29:10] Philip: like nudge and try to cure neurological illnesses like depression, pain management, addiction,
[00:29:17] Philip: et cetera.
[00:29:18] Philip: And who are doing them in ways that are going to be very, very hard to replicate in the future.
[00:29:22] Philip: And I think those companies that can actually solve the problems we're looking at are going
[00:29:26] Philip: to be valuable no matter what.
[00:29:27] Philip: Okay.
[00:29:28] Molly O'Shea: Let's talk about nudge.
[00:29:29] Molly O'Shea: You brought it up and it's really fascinating.
[00:29:33] Molly O'Shea: Tell me everything.
[00:29:34] Molly O'Shea: Well, I'll tell you all the public things.
[00:29:37] Philip: I think the HRIB or LSDH technology companies, you want to make sure that the correct secrets
[00:29:42] Philip: are kept secret.
[00:29:44] Philip: And the way I would think about nudge is the human brain is basically one of the last
[00:29:48] Philip: frontiers of engineering.
[00:29:49] Philip: For a long time, it's been considered a science problem.
[00:29:52] You're something where we'll study it in the clinical study in the lab, but we don't
[00:29:56] Philip: really build products for the brain.
[00:29:58] Philip: The same way we might build products for other parts of the economy or even for human
[00:30:02] Philip: health.
[00:30:03] Philip: And nudge is taking the approach of what if we could engineer the human brain or bring
[00:30:07] Philip: engineering solutions to the brain's problems.
[00:30:09] Philip: And I think for a problem like that, you want people who I describe as life's work founders,
[00:30:14] Philip: people who no matter how much money they have, no matter what island you put them on, only
[00:30:20] Philip: have one missionary purpose in life in life.
[00:30:23] Philip: And I think Jeremy and Fred are both that.
[00:30:26] Philip: Jeremy, like I mentioned, one of the early employees in key leaders at NERLINK, another
[00:30:30] Philip: really amazing neurotech company.
[00:30:33] Philip: Fred was actually one of the early investors in NERLINK and obviously built an incredibly
[00:30:38] Philip: successful company with Coinbase.
[00:30:39] Philip: And I think they are both convinced that the most important thing they can do with their
[00:30:42] Philip: lives is go and actually build a solution to neurological illnesses.
[00:30:47] Philip: So how does nudge work for those who have it hard of it, which I imagine is most people
[00:30:52] Philip: right now, but hopefully not very many people in the future.
[00:30:55] Philip: So much like we use ultrasound to image pregnant women, you can use ultrasound waves to actually
[00:31:02] Philip: simulate brain activity.
[00:31:04] Philip: They're very safe.
[00:31:05] Philip: For comfortable taking images of babies, we should be pretty comfortable using them on
[00:31:08] Philip: ourselves.
[00:31:10] Philip: And so what nudge does is it will take ultrasound waves, it will direct them very, very specific
[00:31:16] Philip: points in the brain that they've identified as being associated with some type of neurological
[00:31:21] Philip: problem and use those waves to stimulate the brain and actually change the neurological
[00:31:26] Philip: activity that's going on there.
[00:31:28] Philip: And ultimately, the goal is how do you have a treatment for neurological illnesses that
[00:31:32] Philip: is easier than taking a pill?
[00:31:34] Philip: Imagine if we could treat really, really tough illnesses like depression addiction by you
[00:31:40] Philip: wearing a set of headsets on your temples and that actually doing meaningful amounts
[00:31:46] Philip: to cure our versus struggling with an illness over a prolonged period of time.
[00:31:49] Philip: So really inspiring mission, the company is early but moving really, really fast.
[00:31:55] Philip: And so if there are any engineers out there that are excited to work on engineering the
[00:31:59] Philip: brain, I think one of the best places in the world to work.
[00:32:01] Philip: So what's the, for most people, what's the difference between neural link and then also
[00:32:04] Molly O'Shea: just traditional like clinical brain simulation?
[00:32:09] Yeah.
[00:32:10] Philip: So neural link really amazing company as well.
[00:32:12] Philip: I think incredibly highly of DJ and Elon and the entire team there that have done huge
[00:32:17] Philip: feats of engineering.
[00:32:19] Philip: I would think about them as you're starting with the weed side of the brain, understanding
[00:32:24] Philip: the brain.
[00:32:25] Philip: They use a invasive neurological implant.
[00:32:28] Philip: So if you are a paraplegic or some with ALS, they will implant a device into your brain
[00:32:35] Philip: with a very relatively easy surgery.
[00:32:38] Philip: They've automated to a high degree.
[00:32:40] Philip: And as of today, this gives you what is called telepathy in classic cool Elon terms,
[00:32:47] Philip: which is to say, I can now control any digital device with my brain.
[00:32:51] Philip: And for people who have paralysis of that degree, this is a life changing experience.
[00:32:56] Philip: And you can imagine you have ALS, you actually knew long-grabble to speak, you can communicate
[00:33:00] Philip: with your loved ones for the first time.
[00:33:02] Philip: You know, we're paralyzed in a ski accident.
[00:33:07] Philip: You can now actually go back to work and do meaningful economic work for the first time
[00:33:12] Philip: by interacting on a computer.
[00:33:13] Philip: So they're on the weed side.
[00:33:14] Philip: For a time, I think they'll actually do a number of things that are really helpful on
[00:33:18] Philip: the right side, too.
[00:33:19] Philip: You know, things from their robot, like blind sight, which they're going to try to restore,
[00:33:23] Philip: sight to the blind.
[00:33:24] Philip: You can imagine things that are actually going to try to restore limbic motion.
[00:33:29] Philip: It's basically biblical miracles.
[00:33:31] Philip: Pretty amazing.
[00:33:32] Philip: We live in an era where this is possible.
[00:33:33] Philip: Moose in the stimulation side.
[00:33:35] Philip: So they are not so much reading what is going on in the brain and interpreting it, but
[00:33:38] Philip: actually targeting specifically affected areas of the drain and trying to stimulate it.
[00:33:43] Philip: And so the closest comparison that we have to this today in modern medicine is something
[00:33:47] Philip: called TMS, which is transgranular magnetic stimulation, where this is really a version
[00:33:54] Philip: of what you might have seen in the movies called Electro-Shock Therapy, where people will
[00:33:58] Philip: more or less use electrodes to zap the brain.
[00:34:02] Philip: It's actually pretty effective.
[00:34:03] Philip: It is very unpleasant.
[00:34:06] Philip: I have not personally tried it.
[00:34:08] Philip: But what kind of diligence is that?
[00:34:10] Philip: I know.
[00:34:11] Philip: I know.
[00:34:12] Philip: Totally slacking here.
[00:34:13] Philip: Did you try it before the podcast?
[00:34:15] Philip: Yeah.
[00:34:16] Philip: You must be a big believer in nudged that.
[00:34:19] Philip: I love nudged.
[00:34:20] Molly O'Shea: Excellent.
[00:34:21] Molly O'Shea: But in case oftentimes people have to do this treatment over many weeks.
[00:34:25] Philip: You have to go to clinics very far away from where you work.
[00:34:28] Philip: And so what's called the second line adoption of this treatment, the number of people who
[00:34:32] Philip: will try this after first line treatments and depression fail is very, very low because
[00:34:37] Philip: no one wants to do this.
[00:34:39] Philip: And so you're not only do we think that ultrasound can be more effective than TMS, but wearing
[00:34:44] Philip: a pair of headphones in your head way easier than going to a clinic to get zapped.
[00:34:49] Philip: So I think hopefully evidence that this is not only possible, but there's just a much,
[00:34:52] Philip: much better way of doing things.
[00:34:54] Philip: Will you try it?
[00:34:55] Molly O'Shea: Nudge.
[00:34:56] Philip: I love to.
[00:34:57] Philip: I mean, I think it's one of the exciting things about nudges that you'd imagine a world
[00:35:01] Philip: where everyone should use nudge because today, they're treating neurological illnesses.
[00:35:07] Philip: And if we can stimulate the brain to get desired outputs, why should I be able to stimulate
[00:35:12] Philip: my mood or my energy levels or maybe my focus levels?
[00:35:17] Philip: And so I think there's a world where actually when we do this podcast to get in 10 years,
[00:35:22] Philip: we're both wearing headphones on our temples.
[00:35:24] Philip: So we're getting us really dialed in to ask great questions to each other.
[00:35:28] Everything is computer.
[00:35:29] Molly O'Shea: Exactly.
[00:35:30] Philip: That's really funny.
[00:35:34] Molly O'Shea: I want to take a step back a little bit and talk more on the funds thesis and the thesis
[00:35:41] Molly O'Shea: on concentration.
[00:35:42] Molly O'Shea: So Peter Walker just recently, he's a researcher at Carter.
[00:35:47] Molly O'Shea: He recently shared this chart that showed spray and prey versus highly concentrated funds.
[00:35:53] Molly O'Shea: Turns out highly concentrated funds, it's typically like 20 companies per portfolio outperforms
[00:36:00] Molly O'Shea: spray and prey, but spray and prey looks pretty good.
[00:36:03] Molly O'Shea: Because you have lots of potential bets.
[00:36:05] Molly O'Shea: So I'm curious with rumored and reported, maybe it's not reported, maybe it's rumored 25
[00:36:12] Molly O'Shea: billion in AUM.
[00:36:13] Molly O'Shea: How do you guys think about where to concentrate your bets?
[00:36:16] Molly O'Shea: Yeah, I think there are two aspects that really matter to Kiddis, which is one, you have
[00:36:20] Philip: to pick a strategy that is authentic to how you want to operate as an investor.
[00:36:24] Philip: My partner, Kreme, often has the line that mathematically, they'll apply a lot of ways we can make
[00:36:29] Philip: money as a venture firm.
[00:36:30] Philip: And the question is, what feels really aligned to the founders we partner with?
[00:36:33] Philip: And I think above all else, I can talk about why concentration, we think is a really great
[00:36:37] Philip: financial strategy and I will.
[00:36:39] Philip: But the most important thing is it allows us to be really deeply aligned with the founders
[00:36:43] Philip: we work with.
[00:36:44] Philip: If you are working with a life's work founder, this is a portfolio of one for them.
[00:36:49] Philip: And we may have a portfolio of few, but we really shouldn't have a portfolio of that
[00:36:52] Philip: many because all the wins should really feel great and all the losses should really
[00:36:56] Philip: hurt.
[00:36:57] Philip: And we should have real skin in the game.
[00:36:59] Philip: And so I think the way we'd like to set ourselves up with is that if we're going to invest
[00:37:02] Philip: in someone, they should really believe that the success and fair of the company really
[00:37:06] Philip: matters to us as investors.
[00:37:08] Philip: And so I think there's actually an emotional and ideological aspect to this.
[00:37:13] Philip: Now, there's also just a reality of the parallel, which is that I don't need to document this
[00:37:19] Philip: for you.
[00:37:20] Philip: It is very clear that a small number of companies drives a disproportionate amount of the
[00:37:24] Philip: economic and social value in the world.
[00:37:26] Philip: I think right now I'd have to check the latest stats, but the mag 7, the NASDAQ, the top
[00:37:30] Philip: seven stocks represent 50% plus of the NASDAQ's market cap.
[00:37:35] Philip: And so that gives to show you that few companies really, really important.
[00:37:39] Philip: And so our concentration strategy just sort of reflects that reality.
[00:37:42] Philip: We want to invest in a small number of companies.
[00:37:45] Philip: They're on the right tail of the distribution, the power wall.
[00:37:47] Philip: They're going to be the most important to how the world works over times.
[00:37:51] Philip: And that's not to say there aren't other great companies that might make us money.
[00:37:53] Philip: We can invest in with a more index-like approach, but in the way in which we think we can deliver
[00:37:59] Philip: differentiated, correlated returns for our partners is through investing in the very best
[00:38:06] Philip: companies.
[00:38:07] Philip: And once we think a company is all of that stature, concentrating as much capital into
[00:38:10] Philip: that company as possible.
[00:38:12] Molly O'Shea: Perfect.
[00:38:13] Molly O'Shea: Okay.
[00:38:14] Molly O'Shea: We're going to talk about OpenAI.
[00:38:15] Molly O'Shea: Great.
[00:38:16] Molly O'Shea: I pulled from Patrick O'Shaumissi's original interview with Josh way back when, and Josh said
[00:38:22] Molly O'Shea: concentrate on the most exceptional businesses and hold on to them over time, case in point.
[00:38:26] Molly O'Shea: Yeah.
[00:38:27] Molly O'Shea: Centration strategy.
[00:38:29] Molly O'Shea: But I also was able to find some data that OpenAI rounds reportedly led by Thrive Capital
[00:38:35] Molly O'Shea: date back to 2023.
[00:38:36] Molly O'Shea: And this was like, right, around inflection point and like the Chatcheebeteer moment.
[00:38:41] Molly O'Shea: So that started in January 2023 at a $29 billion valuation.
[00:38:47] Molly O'Shea: And then the set-up was February 2024 and $86 billion valuation.
[00:38:52] Molly O'Shea: After that, October 2024, $157 billion valuation.
[00:38:57] Molly O'Shea: And then most recently, October 2025 hitting a $500 billion valuation.
[00:39:04] Molly O'Shea: So how did you get involved in OpenAI?
[00:39:06] Molly O'Shea: Yeah.
[00:39:07] I think people probably overestimate how popular the company was in its early days if we
[00:39:14] Philip: want to be perfectly honest.
[00:39:15] Philip: I think Sam and Ilya and Greg and everyone else at the company worked on this project for
[00:39:22] Philip: seven or eight years before others realized how valuable it was.
[00:39:26] Philip: And so actually, if you want to go back to 2022, just clear OpenAI was a really exciting
[00:39:30] Philip: company.
[00:39:31] Philip: We had been spending time with them for many, many months.
[00:39:33] Philip: Josh and Noon Sam for a long time.
[00:39:36] Philip: We actually got a demo of GBT4 in November of 2022 before it was publicly released in March.
[00:39:43] Philip: And it was one of the most astounding pieces of technology we'd ever seen.
[00:39:46] Philip: I think these days, there's a lot of talk of what is AGI, what is an AGI?
[00:39:51] Philip: We could debate that here if you want.
[00:39:53] Philip: Debate it right now.
[00:39:54] Philip: Right now.
[00:39:55] Philip: What does it mean?
[00:39:56] Philip: What does it mean?
[00:39:57] Philip: You and me both have it stumped.
[00:39:59] Molly O'Shea: Okay.
[00:40:00] Molly O'Shea: Great.
[00:40:01] Philip: That was definitely true.
[00:40:02] Philip: That model passed a turning test.
[00:40:05] Philip: There was all this talk for many years of the turning test was this really important moment.
[00:40:09] Philip: You wouldn't be able to recognize it or a computer that was capable of acting like a human
[00:40:14] Philip: or having intelligence of a human.
[00:40:15] Philip: GBT4 was that and we don't talk about it anymore, but that was a really important moment
[00:40:20] Philip: to technological history.
[00:40:22] Philip: And that felt really exciting.
[00:40:23] Philip: At the same time, I think a $29 billion valuation or thereabouts is undoubtedly a high price
[00:40:28] Philip: for a company that, you know, Chad Chip, he hadn't even launched for.
[00:40:31] Philip: And so when we invested in OpenAI in that round, I think we were one of two firms that
[00:40:38] Philip: gave the company a term sheet.
[00:40:40] Philip: And this was actually more an artifact of investment that required belief than sort of competitive
[00:40:45] Philip: edge, so to speak.
[00:40:47] Philip: Now if we fast forward course of three years from now and from there, so much about the
[00:40:55] Philip: company has changed.
[00:40:56] Philip: We looked at our original investment model.
[00:40:58] Philip: There was no mention of Chad chip T and now it has more than a billion users and is
[00:41:04] Philip: on its way to becoming one of the most dominant and important ways in which people access technology,
[00:41:10] Philip: the internet AI, I think it's the front door to AI in many ways.
[00:41:14] Philip: And the company has totally changed in that sense.
[00:41:16] Philip: And as a result, I think when you see these new levels of value get unlocked, you're
[00:41:21] Philip: able to have real confidence in the dominance of the business and its centrality in the
[00:41:25] Philip: arc of technological history, yeah, your confidence in the combination increase.
[00:41:29] Philip: And yeah, you should invest a lot more in the company.
[00:41:31] Philip: So I think the past few years have basically been a story of us having a front-roar
[00:41:36] Philip: seat to that and getting to see this arc unfold up close.
[00:41:40] Philip: I think one of the probably most impressive things to come out of it is the team.
[00:41:47] Molly O'Shea: Yeah.
[00:41:48] Molly O'Shea: Because everything that they've pushed out would seemingly be a tremendous force.
[00:41:53] Molly O'Shea: Like and they continually do it over and over and over again.
[00:41:56] Molly O'Shea: This is something I talked about with a porve from Altimeter.
[00:42:00] Molly O'Shea: They're also investors in OpenAI.
[00:42:02] Molly O'Shea: And it was almost not so much as momentum as a moment, but speed as a moment and continually
[00:42:08] Molly O'Shea: pushing things out and trying things.
[00:42:10] Molly O'Shea: And it went back from like voice to text, text of voice, all this kind of stuff.
[00:42:16] Molly O'Shea: And it seems like every month, every week, every day, there's something new coming out
[00:42:22] Molly O'Shea: of that company.
[00:42:24] Molly O'Shea: And so how do you think about how they have recruited, they've assembled team and the
[00:42:29] Molly O'Shea: talent around it?
[00:42:30] Molly O'Shea: Yeah.
[00:42:31] Philip: I think one of the great privileges of my career has been able to spend time with the OpenAI
[00:42:35] Philip: team.
[00:42:36] Philip: Not just because they're great people and brilliant thinkers, but the talent density as you're
[00:42:42] Philip: pointing out is really unprecedented.
[00:42:44] Philip: And there are good reasons for this.
[00:42:46] Philip: If you are building what I think is one of the most important technological innovations
[00:42:51] Philip: since the atomic era, forget the internet, yes, a lot of the really brilliant people in
[00:42:56] Philip: the world are going to go work on it.
[00:42:58] Philip: Now I think the really cool thing about OpenAI is they've attracted a lot of the star power
[00:43:02] Philip: researchers, you know, Ilya, literally invented Alex Stent back in the day, which kicked off
[00:43:06] Philip: the deep learning revolution.
[00:43:08] Philip: And a lot of the really great researchers at OpenAI have come up through OpenAI and we're
[00:43:14] Philip: not famous entities or well known people before.
[00:43:16] Philip: But Alec Radford who has had the company for a very long time famously did not even really
[00:43:21] Philip: study AI when he was a student and was one of the most prolific and impactful researchers
[00:43:26] Philip: of the company.
[00:43:27] Philip: And the other things OpenAI is done really well is they have actually looked for young talent
[00:43:31] Philip: in the AI era.
[00:43:32] Philip: I think this is a really important thing and one of the things that Kershwar has actually
[00:43:35] Philip: been really attuned to as well as the people who almost hold the model weights in their
[00:43:40] Philip: brains because they've been brought up thinking about AI natively are really, really good at
[00:43:46] Philip: the creative thinking and experiments and hypothesis testing that is necessary to push the performance
[00:43:53] Philip: of these models.
[00:43:54] Philip: And Sora, you know, recent OpenAI product launch, I think if you look at the average
[00:43:59] Philip: or median age of that team, I think it's in the low 20s.
[00:44:02] Philip: It's pretty amazing.
[00:44:05] Philip: And so long way of saying, OpenAI one has the benefit of, yeah, if you're a great, you
[00:44:10] Philip: know, computer scientist, you probably should be working on, you know, building some type
[00:44:14] Philip: of super intelligence.
[00:44:16] Philip: And two, they've been really risk forward about trying to find people who could be great
[00:44:21] Philip: versus who are already great.
[00:44:22] Philip: And I think that has actually allowed them to bring up and train several generations
[00:44:27] Philip: of great researchers in the company itself versus just getting to hire the people who
[00:44:32] Philip: have already been proven entities.
[00:44:34] Philip: How do you think about the evolution of OpenAI and where it goes to one of the sponsors
[00:44:40] Molly O'Shea: that proudly sponsors sorcery is touring.
[00:44:45] Molly O'Shea: And so I've gotten exposure to the AI research side of things or an AI research accelerator
[00:44:50] Molly O'Shea: so they help out with the models.
[00:44:53] Molly O'Shea: And right now they're noticing the severe shift in the last quarter or two on imitation
[00:44:59] Molly O'Shea: data, synthetic data to reinforce learning.
[00:45:02] Molly O'Shea: And so I'm curious how you're seeing it on the technical side and then also on the application
[00:45:06] Molly O'Shea: side.
[00:45:07] I think AI is a little bit like semiconductors in a sense.
[00:45:09] Philip: If I'm allowed to go back to semiconductors, the great touchstone.
[00:45:13] Philip: And that's, in the sense that there are many, many waves as we're trying to get better
[00:45:18] Philip: and better performance.
[00:45:19] Philip: And with semiconductors, we used to have single core semiconductors.
[00:45:24] Philip: Then we couldn't basically squeeze anything more of the single core.
[00:45:27] Philip: So we went to multi core and then we went to GPUs.
[00:45:30] Philip: And I think we're seeing something very similar with AI, which is that you know, we started
[00:45:33] Philip: with pre training back in GBT1, GBT2, AirdGPT3 that took us to GBT4.
[00:45:40] Philip: Then we started using a lot of post training techniques for chat GBT, supervised fine tuning,
[00:45:45] Philip: reinforcement learning with human feedback.
[00:45:47] Philip: These are what allowed the models to be less alien intelligences and more helpful assistance.
[00:45:52] Philip: And you know, and now as a lot of the low-hanging fruit for those gains have been squeezed out,
[00:45:57] Philip: even though there's probably a lot more to do, reinforcement learning has been sort of the
[00:46:00] Philip: next big paradigm shift in AI and where a lot of the resources are going.
[00:46:05] Philip: My guess is there's going to be a couple more of these.
[00:46:08] Philip: This is not the end of the story.
[00:46:10] Philip: We are basically figuring out in real time how to do the alchemy of turning pieces of
[00:46:15] Philip: metals into thinking machines, so to speak.
[00:46:19] Philip: And that is a really tough and challenging thing.
[00:46:22] Philip: And I think the re-exciting thing about OpenAI is that yes, it's one of the great product
[00:46:27] Philip: companies of today.
[00:46:28] Philip: But it's also a research effort.
[00:46:30] Philip: These are not things that we have fully discovered and figured out yet.
[00:46:33] Philip: So I think a long way of saying the ultimate competitive advantage for the labs and for OpenAI
[00:46:39] Philip: in particular is actually being able to constantly figure out what the next paradigm is, even
[00:46:44] Philip: as you're productizing and implementing the last paradigm.
[00:46:47] Philip: And I think one of the highest testaments I can give to OpenAI is that every single major
[00:46:53] Philip: paradigm in large models at this macro level that has been very successful to my knowledge
[00:46:58] Philip: has come from OpenAI or at least been originated at OpenAI.
[00:47:02] Philip: And I think that speaks really strong into their ability to continue to push the frontier
[00:47:06] Philip: of research going forward.
[00:47:07] Philip: One of the lines that comes out of cursor is what comes after code.
[00:47:11] Molly O'Shea: Yeah.
[00:47:12] Molly O'Shea: What comes after OpenAI?
[00:47:16] That's the question for you.
[00:47:17] Molly O'Shea: I think the beauty is one, hopefully OpenAI is going to be an enduring technology.
[00:47:23] Philip: And so I'm very surprised if in the near term we were talking about an after OpenAI.
[00:47:28] Philip: Is there an after meta or an after Google?
[00:47:31] Philip: I think the better framing of a question, if I could tweak it, would be something like
[00:47:39] Philip: one of the companies that can now be built as a result of OpenAI.
[00:47:41] Philip: I think there is a what comes after SaaS?
[00:47:44] Philip: That is a more interesting way of thinking about this.
[00:47:47] Philip: We had an old way of building software.
[00:47:49] Philip: There are these cloud primitives.
[00:47:50] Philip: We build these great digital apps on top of them.
[00:47:53] Philip: A lot of really amazing companies that we had the privilege to invest in.
[00:47:56] Philip: Now there's a new substrate for technology, which is what if you could productize intelligence
[00:48:00] Philip: and call it via API or fine tune a model with it?
[00:48:03] Philip: And I think that engenders an entirely new breed of software companies.
[00:48:07] Philip: So I don't think it's an after OpenAI.
[00:48:10] Philip: I think it's an after SaaS that we're going to see.
[00:48:12] Philip: And so we're seeing the early signs of this, something like cursor where we're actually
[00:48:16] Philip: thinking about products that can work with you as a sort of collaborator in order of creating
[00:48:22] Philip: work.
[00:48:23] Philip: We're seeing this with products like Harvey on the legal side where they are doing work,
[00:48:28] Philip: as well as just acting as an assistant.
[00:48:30] Philip: We're seeing this with products that are even coming in products.
[00:48:34] Philip: We as for instance now has a security assistant to help you find entreeage vulnerabilities.
[00:48:39] Philip: But I think there basically is a new set of building blocks that we've gotten.
[00:48:43] Philip: And I think the right way to think about it is software is going to look very different
[00:48:46] Philip: going forward.
[00:48:48] Philip: But yeah, the big fundamental companies, I think they're going to be around for a while.
[00:48:51] Philip: The other standard second order question of this is impact on jobs.
[00:48:57] Molly O'Shea: CalCity recently had a chart out that was up to 86% thought we would have more layoffs
[00:49:03] Molly O'Shea: this year in tech than in 2024.
[00:49:06] Molly O'Shea: How's that going?
[00:49:08] Molly O'Shea: I don't think it's, yeah, definitely take the under.
[00:49:12] Molly O'Shea: But public companies have been reporting more layoffs.
[00:49:17] Molly O'Shea: It's part of like a natural cycle and etc.
[00:49:19] Molly O'Shea: Do you think that AI and these tools will create more efficiencies, create new jobs where
[00:49:25] Molly O'Shea: are you in this whole discussion and debate?
[00:49:28] Molly O'Shea: Yeah, I'll give you my bottoms up and top down answer.
[00:49:30] Philip: My bottoms up answer is I'm an investor in a lot of companies that use AI tools.
[00:49:36] Philip: I cannot think, especially on sort of the coding side and engineering side of a single
[00:49:40] Philip: one that is laid off engineers because of these tools.
[00:49:43] Philip: I think it may be to allow them to grow without adding quite as much headcount, but really
[00:49:47] Philip: what is done is allow them to go after a much wider range of problems.
[00:49:51] Philip: You can actually make everyone the 10X or the verbal 100X engineering a really exciting
[00:49:56] Philip: way.
[00:49:57] Philip: And so thus far, I think just empirically, will there be some turnover and economic
[00:50:01] Philip: centers?
[00:50:02] Philip: Of course, there always is.
[00:50:03] Philip: There's actually been much more of an augmenting technology that is substituting technology.
[00:50:08] Philip: And then I think as we look into the future and look beyond just cursors of the world,
[00:50:13] Philip: but to this notion of what does it look like to have very powerful intelligent AI more
[00:50:17] Philip: generally, there's just a lot of problems that is a species we aren't working on right
[00:50:22] Philip: now that we should be working on.
[00:50:24] Philip: Way more people should be working on, you know, sure as to oncology.
[00:50:27] Philip: Way more people should be thinking about what does it look like to actually sustainably
[00:50:32] Philip: mind the world's natural resources?
[00:50:34] Philip: What does it look like to actually make us, you know, a space-faring species?
[00:50:37] Philip: And I think the beauty of AI is that we're going to be able to reallocate a bunch of
[00:50:41] Philip: human brain power, fire power, creativity to these most important problems and away from
[00:50:47] Philip: the things that have been great jobs to date, but are not the highest marginal use of
[00:50:53] Philip: humanity's creative and intelligence potential.
[00:50:56] Philip: And so I think there's just a lot of problems left to go solve and AI is going to help us
[00:50:59] Philip: solve the most important of these versus less important problems.
[00:51:03] Philip: Where do you stand in the AI bubble debate?
[00:51:06] Hmm.
[00:51:07] I think this is one where being concentrated allows us to feel a little bit better about
[00:51:10] Philip: no matter how the world works out, we're going to be in the right circumstances.
[00:51:13] Philip: And it turned out that if you invested in Google in 1999 in 2001 and 2004 and 2005 and
[00:51:23] Philip: you were a long-term investor at Google, you might have had some variability in returns,
[00:51:27] Philip: it was a pretty great investment.
[00:51:29] Philip: Likewise with Amazon, likewise with Netflix, likewise, like, or soft.
[00:51:32] Philip: And so I think we really just think about what are going to be the enduring companies
[00:51:37] Philip: versus trying to time the market cycles.
[00:51:39] Philip: And so that's my honest thought.
[00:51:41] Philip: You know, I think there's a lot of value to be created out of AI.
[00:51:45] Philip: I actually think in a lot of the rounds we participated in, they felt eminently rational
[00:51:49] Philip: to us.
[00:51:50] Philip: But I think the most important thing is being the right companies and trust that if you've
[00:51:55] Philip: picked the right companies and want to be the multi-decade holders of those companies,
[00:51:59] Philip: that's for wash out.
[00:52:00] Philip: And where do you stand on the exit environment for this?
[00:52:03] Molly O'Shea: Open AI is one of, if not the highest valued private companies.
[00:52:07] Molly O'Shea: So do you go public?
[00:52:09] Molly O'Shea: Can you?
[00:52:10] Where, like, what do you think about this and for private companies?
[00:52:13] Molly O'Shea: When we invest in companies, it is almost always with the intention that if they want
[00:52:17] Philip: to, they can at some point be a standalone public company.
[00:52:20] Philip: I don't know.
[00:52:21] Philip: Open AI is particular plans for this.
[00:52:22] Philip: But I think, you know, we should expect that most great technology companies will be public
[00:52:27] Philip: companies over time.
[00:52:29] Philip: Part takes some, in some case, a little bit longer than in the past.
[00:52:32] Philip: In some cases, maybe shorter.
[00:52:34] Philip: But I think you have American capitalism is that everyone gets to participate in the
[00:52:39] Philip: growth story of these really important economic engines.
[00:52:42] Philip: And I think we think that's more the right thing to do.
[00:52:45] Philip: And also we think this is how most companies will choose to represent themselves over time.
[00:52:51] Interesting.
[00:52:52] Well, if you didn't know this, source to response your mind, Brex.
[00:52:56] Molly O'Shea: Awesome.
[00:52:57] Molly O'Shea: Amazing.
[00:52:58] I'll throw out my ramp card in my pocket right now.
[00:53:01] Philip: Do it.
[00:53:02] Molly O'Shea: Thank you.
[00:53:03] Molly O'Shea: That's so generous.
[00:53:04] Molly O'Shea: So, Brex is all about spending smarter, moving faster, performance.
[00:53:07] Molly O'Shea: I'm really, really curious about this question.
[00:53:10] Molly O'Shea: Because Thrive is like such a stealth fund, a huge fund, and you do a lot of different
[00:53:15] Molly O'Shea: things from incubations to funding very large rounds of companies.
[00:53:20] Molly O'Shea: How do you think about performance as a team?
[00:53:22] Molly O'Shea: And like, how do you think about performance as an investor on a very small team?
[00:53:26] Molly O'Shea: If you have decision processes a lot more than near-term outcomes, I think when I worked
[00:53:32] Philip: at Bridgewater earlier in my career, Ray Dalio had this very famous line of focus on the
[00:53:36] Philip: swing, not where the ball goes.
[00:53:38] Philip: And I actually think that's very much how we operate, which is that we want to have the
[00:53:42] Philip: shot on goal with the most exciting companies.
[00:53:44] Philip: We want to have the right conversations around those companies.
[00:53:48] Philip: We want to be, as my partner, Miles likes to say, paranoid, but patient, always thinking
[00:53:53] Philip: about what could be, but not necessarily rushing into things.
[00:53:56] Philip: But I think that structure is really what we anchor to.
[00:54:00] Philip: We have seen plenty of companies that didn't look like they went anywhere for the first
[00:54:04] Philip: or years.
[00:54:05] Philip: If you were an investor in OpenAI, you know, it was a nonprofit in 2017 and 2018, and
[00:54:10] Philip: even sort of a capped nonprofit with profit like shares in 2019 and 2020, you might have
[00:54:17] Philip: thought, oh my gosh, what is this thing going to do?
[00:54:19] Philip: It's going to go anywhere.
[00:54:21] Philip: And of course, now, one of the most valuable companies in the world.
[00:54:23] Philip: My contrast, I'm sure we can think of plenty of companies that look hot coming out of
[00:54:27] Philip: the gates at first.
[00:54:28] Philip: And at some point, it looked less good thereafter, which is all to say, when we make decisions
[00:54:35] Philip: to the team, is that no matter what performance looks like for this company in the next one
[00:54:39] Philip: to two years, we're going to be confident that we made the right decision because we looked
[00:54:44] Philip: at the right inputs for this.
[00:54:45] Philip: And so I think the worst types of investments to make are investments where if the numbers
[00:54:50] Philip: change one quarter or one year, all of a sudden start to feel bad about the company.
[00:54:55] Philip: Because that suggests to me that you're not investing in the fundamentals of the company,
[00:54:59] Philip: you're investing in the momentum of the company.
[00:55:01] Philip: And I think that is rarely the right way to capture really long-term value.
[00:55:05] We were kind of joking about this in the beginning, but I don't know what data is.
[00:55:08] Molly O'Shea: You don't know what data is.
[00:55:10] Molly O'Shea: I thought it was February.
[00:55:11] Molly O'Shea: It's apparently almost November.
[00:55:14] Molly O'Shea: But what are you looking forward to in the next 12 months?
[00:55:17] Molly O'Shea: Hmm.
[00:55:18] Philip: Great question.
[00:55:19] Philip: First off, I think we're in this moment where reinforced learning, as you mentioned,
[00:55:23] Philip: is this new lever.
[00:55:24] Philip: But we've seen it make its way into very few new software products.
[00:55:28] Philip: I think few products in the labs.
[00:55:30] Philip: We were having some coding companies like Cursor have done some really cool things that
[00:55:34] Philip: they've mentioned on their blog.
[00:55:37] Philip: But relatively speaking, not that many RL problems and projects out there in the world right
[00:55:42] Philip: now in production, I'm really excited to see that change.
[00:55:45] Philip: I think it's one of these really powerful things where we now have a lot of the inputs
[00:55:50] Philip: required to go automate large amounts of really high, drudgerous work.
[00:55:57] Philip: And I think we're going to see software companies start to productize that over the coming
[00:56:01] Philip: months and years.
[00:56:02] Philip: So that's one thing I'm really excited about.
[00:56:03] Philip: I think the other is the point of intelligent hardware.
[00:56:07] Philip: I think we're going to see a real renaissance of problems that don't just have to be solved
[00:56:11] Philip: with bits.
[00:56:12] Philip: They can also be solved with atoms as well.
[00:56:14] Philip: Sometimes to make a real impact on the world, you actually need to move something in reality.
[00:56:19] Philip: And so we're investors in physical intelligence doing this on the robotics side.
[00:56:22] Philip: We've talked about Nudge, talked about Mash, talked about Androle.
[00:56:26] Philip: But I think we're going to see a new wave of companies that can actually address the large
[00:56:30] Philip: swath of global GDP in well north of 50%.
[00:56:33] Philip: We're actually affecting the physical world really matters.
[00:56:36] Philip: And then finally, I think there are going to be some really exciting developments in applying
[00:56:40] Philip: AI to science.
[00:56:41] Philip: There's an isomorphic lab which is a very proud investor in which is Alphabet's drug discovery
[00:56:50] Philip: and life sciences AI portfolio.
[00:56:53] Philip: And there's a new company called Periodic which is working on material science which we
[00:56:57] Philip: are not an investor in but is doing really awesome work on new material discovery.
[00:57:01] Philip: And I think there's this cool question of at what point in your similar discussion on Nudge
[00:57:05] Philip: do science problems become engineering problems thanks to the power of AI.
[00:57:09] Philip: And I'm really excited to see how that transitions and evolves with the next few months.
[00:57:13] Philip: It's a lot to look forward to.
[00:57:15] Molly O'Shea: I know we're a really exciting time.
[00:57:16] Philip: It's really exciting.
[00:57:17] Molly O'Shea: Well, thank you so much.
