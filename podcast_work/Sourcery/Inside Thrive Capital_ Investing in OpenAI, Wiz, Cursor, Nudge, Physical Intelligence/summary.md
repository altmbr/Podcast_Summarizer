# Inside Thrive Capital: Investing in OpenAI, Wiz, Cursor, Nudge, Physical Intelligence

## 1. Key Themes

### The Speed Chess Era of AI vs. The Chess Era of Internet

Philip Carter shares a profound insight from Michael Dell, who has lived through both the internet and AI eras: "In some ways [they] feel very similar in magnitude of impact. But whereas the internet era was like playing chess, the AI era is like playing speed chess." [00:07:06]

This acceleration is evident in Cursor's trajectory. When Thrive invested, the company had "a couple tens of thousands of users and low single digits million AR." Today, they're at "many, many hundreds of millions of run rate revenue and many millions of developers using the product" - all within just 18 months. [00:06:30]

### Hardware's Hidden Geometric Growth Pattern

Carter challenges conventional wisdom about hardware businesses, revealing that "some of the only companies that actually accelerated growth at scale" are hardware companies like Anduril, SpaceX, and Tesla. These companies "are growing at a faster rate at a multi-billion dollar scale than they were when [they] were small." [00:25:33]

This contrasts sharply with typical software companies that experience deteriorating growth rates over time. The reason: "The bigger you get, the bigger markets you can access, and the more people trust you to take on big problems." [00:25:46]

### The Deal/Speed Ratio as Ultimate Enterprise SaaS Metric

In analyzing Wiz's exceptional performance, Carter identifies a crucial but overlooked metric: "The size of the deals you can sell versus the speed at which you can sell deals." Wiz achieved something unprecedented - "closing on these very healthy six figure deals in a matter of weeks or months" while most companies face a trade-off between "small deals and fast cycles" or "big deals and slow cycles." [00:15:38]

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### Flying into a War Zone When No One Else Would

When other investors wouldn't travel to Israel during the Gaza war in early 2024, Carter and Josh flew there in 12-24 hours to meet with Wiz. But Carter reframes this: "We don't really do it thinking about other players from the field. You play against yourself, you don't play against others. If our founders were going to be in Israel during what was a trying time, we wanted to be in Israel and show them that that mattered to us too." [00:14:45]

This wasn't about competitive advantage - it was about values alignment.

### OpenAI Wasn't Popular in Early Days

Contrary to current perception, Carter reveals that when Thrive invested in OpenAI at a $29 billion valuation in early 2023, "we were one of two firms that gave the company a term sheet. And this was actually more an artifact of investment that required belief than sort of competitive edge." [00:40:38]

The company worked on the project "for seven or eight years before others realized how valuable it was." [00:39:26]

### Hardware Barriers Are Actually Advantages

While the venture industry traditionally avoids hardware because it's "definitely harder than software," Carter argues this creates durability: "When you get over the hump of these really, really hard industries and problems, you've actually built something at scale that is very hard to quickly replicate." [00:24:55]

He poses the rhetorical question: "It's really hard to imagine who is possibly going to disrupt SpaceX at this point, knock on wood, or what is going to be someone who could really go out and disrupt Anduril." [00:24:45]

### AI as Augmentation, Not Replacement (Empirically)

Counter to widespread layoff fears, Carter provides ground truth: "I'm an investor in a lot of companies that use AI tools. I cannot think, especially on the coding side and engineering side, of a single one that has laid off engineers because of these tools." [00:49:40]

Instead, these tools "allow everyone to be the 10X or the 100X engineer in a really exciting way." [00:49:56]

## 3. Companies Identified

**Why Mentioned:** Demonstrates OpenAI's ability to develop talent internally rather than just hiring proven entities.

**Quote:** "Alec Radford who has [been] at the company for a very long time famously did not even really study AI when he was a student and was one of the most prolific and impactful researchers of the company." [00:43:21] - Philip Carter

## 5. Operating Insights

### The Concentration-Alignment Loop

Carter reveals Thrive's philosophy: "If you are working with a life's work founder, this is a portfolio of one for them. And we may have a portfolio of few, but we really shouldn't have a portfolio of that many because all the wins should really feel great and all the losses should really hurt." [00:44:49]

This creates authentic alignment rather than just financial strategy. The concentration strategy mirrors founders' own risk profile.

### The Strategic Pause: Fleet Fungibility Over Rapid Expansion

When evaluating Wiz, Carter identified a critical but counterintuitive metric: "I actually think often looking at [the] ratio [of deal size to implementation speed] is a really, really powerful metric of basically how many dollars can you turn as a company and how quickly can you change your market." [00:15:38]

This ratio matters more than absolute revenue or growth rate because it indicates true product-market fit and sales efficiency simultaneously.

### Young Talent in AI Has Distinct Advantages

OpenAI's approach challenges conventional hiring wisdom. Carter notes that "the people who almost hold the model weights in their brains because they've been brought up thinking about AI natively are really, really good at the creative thinking and experiments and hypothesis testing that is necessary to push the performance of these models." [00:43:40]

The Sora team has a "median age in the low 20s." [00:44:02]

### Process Over Outcomes in Performance Evaluation

Drawing from Ray Dalio at Bridgewater, Carter emphasizes: "Focus on the swing, not where the ball goes." The team evaluates "decision processes a lot more than near-term outcomes." [00:53:32]

The test: "No matter what performance looks like for this company in the next one to two years, we're going to be confident that we made the right decision because we looked at the right inputs." [00:54:39]

### The Post-Training Paradigm Shift Sequence

Carter outlines the evolution of AI capabilities: "We started with pre-training back in GPT-1, GPT-2, and GPT-3 that took us to GPT-4. Then we started using a lot of post-training techniques for ChatGPT, supervised fine tuning, reinforcement learning with human feedback... and now... reinforcement learning has been the next big paradigm shift." [00:45:45]

Understanding these paradigm shifts and productizing the previous while researching the next represents OpenAI's core competitive advantage.

## 6. Overlooked Insights

### The Developer-as-Security-User Signal

Carter briefly mentions something profound that most missed about Wiz: "50% of Wiz's users at the time were software developers, not security people. Very different than how security is traditionally done." [00:12:25]

This single metric predicted Wiz's platform potential and departure from traditional security tools. It indicated they'd built infrastructure, not just compliance software - a category expansion that led to Google's acquisition offer being the largest ever for a startup.

### Science-to-Engineering Phase Transitions

Almost in passing, Carter identifies a massive opportunity: "There's this cool question of at what point... do science problems become engineering problems thanks to the power of AI." [00:57:05]

He cites companies like Isomorphic Labs (drug discovery) and Periodic (materials science) as examples. This represents a fundamental shift in how humanity approaches R&D - moving from observation and hypothesis to engineering and production. The companies that capture this transition early will create entirely new markets.
