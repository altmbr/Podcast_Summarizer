# [Summarization: Alfred Lin (Sequoia Capital) - Investment Philosophy & Operating Insights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FnDah-9oS4)

## 1. Key Themes

### Quality Over Growth Speed: The Retention-First Philosophy
Alfred Lin emphasizes that sustainable, quality revenue matters far more than rapid revenue growth. The focus should be on input metrics (engagement, retention) before output metrics (revenue).

**Substantiation:**
"I prefer to have slower growth quality revenue than fast growth, non-quality revenue... This idea that we have we can just get to 100 million dollars in revenue... I think quality of the revenue matters. That's why one time revenue is not seen as good as subscription revenue." - Alfred Lin

"The input metric is engagement then retention then monetization... DoorDash did an extremely good job of being focused on how many orders is the user actually order. How did they retain over time and then we can figure out how much we want to monetize." - Alfred Lin

### Efficiency as the Strategic Weapon, Not Capital
Lin argues that business model efficiency and unit economics are the true competitive advantages, not the ability to raise more capital than competitors.

**Substantiation:**
"You can either take this view that capital is a strategic weapon which some people have said or you can take a view that your business model is your strategic weapon, your product is your strategic weapon, your efficiency or your unit economics is your strategic weapon... We're not going to be all raised as much money as Uber. But we're still going to win because we're going to be twice as efficient and for every $100 that we spend acquiring customers we're going to get twice as many customers." - Alfred Lin on DoorDash

"Capital and marketing dollars are really fuel but do you have a fire burning and if you have a fire burning really really hot you want to pour fuel on it. If you don't have a fire burning pouring fuel on the ground it's not going to burn." - Alfred Lin

### Board Member Adaptability: Shock Absorber vs. Sparring Partner
Sequoia's approach to board membership varies based on company circumstances - providing support during hardships and pushing for excellence during success.

**Substantiation:**
"This is a very sequer characteristic of board members. We partner with the founders and we know to be shock absorbers during bad times and to be sparring partners during good times... When the company is down, there is no point to beat someone when they're down. The best thing you can do is roll up your sleeves, pick up the pieces and help the company get through that hardship." - Alfred Lin

"When things are going well, you want to be a sparring partner. You want to take things to the next level... One of the things I always reflect on is companies when things are going well, they get low arrogance. And the first sign of why companies fail is the hubris of much success." - Alfred Lin

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### The "Overnight Success" Myth is Completely False
Counter to the narrative that successful companies grow quickly, Lin argues every successful company takes much longer than expected, and extended timelines don't indicate failure.

**Substantiation:**
"The sort of natural tendency that every founder or investor thinks is like, oh, all these successes are overnight successiveness. It's just not true. Every founder has their journey and it's taken longer than they want. Even if one of the things go fast, it takes longer than they want." - Alfred Lin

He provides specific examples: Kalshi took 18 months just to launch their first event (now takes hours), and the regulatory journey was brutal. Zipline required a complete pivot and relocation to Rwanda.

### Revenue Growth Metrics are Often Misleading and Gamed
Lin provides a detailed breakdown of how revenue is frequently misrepresented, arguing that the race to $100M ARR often masks underlying business problems.

**Substantiation:**
"Revenue as a financial metric is an output metric. And the health of the business is not just the output metric but it's a bunch of input metrics... I think revenue as the metric is is a lazy way of looking at the problem. You have to look at the underlying metrics." - Alfred Lin

"There's pilot revenue... Professional services revenue... Revenue where you get a revenue share and you tell people your gross revenue, not your net revenue... There are all these little things and little tricks. And I think it's not trying to be devious or anything, but we don't sort of break out all these different revenue into into these different parts." - Alfred Lin

### Suing Your Regulator Can Be the Right Strategic Move
Against conventional wisdom that companies should maintain positive relationships with regulators, Lin supported Kalshi's decision to sue the CFTC.

**Substantiation:**
"It's generally not a great aid to sue your regulator unless you have a really strong case. And there was a lot of thinking and back and forth about exactly what the calculus was on how we would win. And we thought we had a really strong case. And Tarak and Moana were fearless. And that's why they were able to propose that we sue our regulator of ours and to open up elections. And we won." - Alfred Lin

### Deliver Value Before Capturing It - Delay Monetization
Contrary to the pressure to show revenue quickly, Lin advocates for proving value delivery before monetization.

**Substantiation:**
"One of the things that I think we forget is that startups are great at figuring out how to deliver value. And then after you deliver value then you want to capture value. And so the same is true with revenue. Let's figure out whether we deliver value first before we monetize it." - Alfred Lin

### The Acceleration of Technology Makes Being a Founder Harder, Not Easier
While tools and infrastructure have improved, Lin argues this actually makes competition more intense and founder success more difficult.

**Substantiation:**
"In technology, we live in the world of accelerating change. Things are moving faster today than 10 years ago... Part of that means that founders today have a harder job than founders a decade ago. That's just the price of progress... It's a lot harder to get above the fray because once you launch and you have any success, 15 competitors show up." - Alfred Lin

## 3. Companies Identified

### DoorDash
**Description:** Food delivery marketplace that competed against better-funded rivals through superior unit economics and efficiency.

**Quotes:**
"We're not going to be all raised as much money as Uber. But we're still going to win because we're going to be twice as efficient and for every $100 that we spend acquiring customers we're going to get twice as many customers." - Alfred Lin

"There were a number of metrics that DoorDash tracked that were all about retention. They were very focused on making the retention curves, the cohort curves smile. And I think that was the reason for much of their success." - Alfred Lin

### Kalshi
**Description:** First regulated events marketplace/exchange in the US, allowing trading on event outcomes.

**Quotes:**
"Kalshi, the thing that they wanted to do was to be the first regulated events marketplace for an exchange. And that took a long time just to get the regulatory side to get work with the CFTC to get regulated... When they first started, it probably took 18 months to launch their first event and now it takes a matter of hours." - Alfred Lin

"Tarak and Moana were fearless. And that's why they were able to propose that we sue our regulator of ours and to open up elections. And we won and then we pivoted small little p-pivots to elections... And now there's a small little p-pivot to two sports." - Alfred Lin

### Zipline
**Description:** Drone delivery company that pivoted from mobile robotics platform to medical deliveries in Africa.

**Quotes:**
"Zipline, they started out with this idea of building a mobile platform for robotics where the iPhone was going to be the brains. And what they ended up with was what Keller would say was kind of like a toy... Keller went back to the drawing board and came back and said, you know what? I think what we want to build drones." - Alfred Lin

"We're going to go out to Rwanda. We're going to prove out that we can do this. And then we can bring back all of the safety records to the US and eventually be allowed to fly in the US, which is what has happened now." - Alfred Lin

### Figma
**Description:** Collaborative web-based design tool that achieved feature parity with Photoshop while enabling new workflows.

**Quotes:**
"Figma just won public recently. It took a long time for them to be on the same feature parity with Photoshop. But it was collaborative is obviously going to be the next generation on how you sort of collaborate with designers. You can do it on the web instead of like walking over to designers desktop and seeing what they designed. But at the same time, it took time to build the product in
