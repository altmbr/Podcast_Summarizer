[00:00:00] When the company is down, there is no point to beat someone when they're down.
[00:00:04] The best thing you can do is roll up your sleeves, pick up the pieces and help the company get through that hardship.
[00:00:09] And that's what we do at Sequoia.
[00:00:10] Both Tenei and Tarek said throughout the time you've been very supportive,
[00:00:15] but now it seems the relationship is much more focused and a little bit more intense.
[00:00:20] This is a very sequer characteristic of board members.
[00:00:23] We partner with the founders and we know to be shock absorbers during bad times
[00:00:28] and to be sparring partners during good times.
[00:00:30] You back a wide range of companies, but what is that through line for you?
[00:00:35] At Sequoia, we're focused on outlier founders.
[00:00:38] And that's pretty consistent to how many companies and how many founders we have to see
[00:00:43] before we make one investment.
[00:00:44] Those two companies, Athelis, Camira, and then Kalshi,
[00:00:47] the stories are very, very different even though it took a long time.
[00:00:50] The sort of natural tendency that every founder or investor thinks is like,
[00:00:55] oh, all these successors are overnight successors.
[00:00:57] It's just not true.
[00:00:58] Every founder has their journey and it's taken longer than they want.
[00:01:02] Even if one of the things go fast, it takes longer than they want.
[00:01:05] This idea that we have, we can just get to 100 million dollars in revenue,
[00:01:09] that's the goal.
[00:01:10] I think quality of the revenue matters.
[00:01:12] It's why one-time revenue is not seen as good as subscription revenue.
[00:01:16] In technology, we live in a world of accelerating change.
[00:01:19] Things are moving faster today than 10 years ago.
[00:01:22] 10 years ago, things were moving faster than 10 years before that.
[00:01:25] And part of that means that founders today have a harder job than founders a decade ago.
[00:01:41] All right.
[00:01:42] Wow. Alfred Lynn, welcome to Sorcery.
[00:01:44] Well, thank you for having me on the show.
[00:01:46] This is so fun.
[00:01:48] It feels like a long time coming.
[00:01:50] Well, I've been listening to what you've been producing in the last few months.
[00:01:53] And the shows have been great.
[00:01:56] Well, I have had a highlight reel of Alfred Lynn's portfolio.
[00:02:02] I'm going to get more on too.
[00:02:04] So I've gotten to know Kalshi really well.
[00:02:08] I've gotten to know Nomenal really well, helped break their funding announcement.
[00:02:13] I recently, just yesterday, was at Camier's office, was meeting with tonight.
[00:02:17] I got a nice tour of physical intelligence with Brian.
[00:02:21] And they all have the same through line.
[00:02:23] And it's Alfred Lynn.
[00:02:25] I'm curious.
[00:02:26] You back a wide range of companies.
[00:02:30] And this also includes Citadel securities.
[00:02:32] And I want to go deep into this later because I find it fascinating.
[00:02:34] But what is that through line for you?
[00:02:37] I don't really think about the through line per se, but maybe there's a through line of
[00:02:45] my tastes in in founders.
[00:02:47] And we always start with the founders.
[00:02:50] And I think the companies that you named and many more at Sequoia,
[00:02:55] were focused on outlier founders.
[00:02:57] And you can ask the question, what does what makes someone an outlier?
[00:03:00] And you can express it in maybe in statistical terms.
[00:03:04] One standard deviation above the mean is good.
[00:03:07] Two is great.
[00:03:09] Three is exceptional.
[00:03:10] And four standard deviations above the mean would be an outlier.
[00:03:15] And that's pretty consistent to how many companies and how many founders we have to see
[00:03:20] before we make one investment.
[00:03:22] On typically we see about a thousand companies before we make one investment.
[00:03:27] And on top of that being an outlier,
[00:03:30] I love founders that have a unique novel insight into the world.
[00:03:34] And they mostly see a problem in the world that the world is solved incorrectly.
[00:03:40] In their view, and they want to change it.
[00:03:42] And they have the daringness and the purpose and the desire to go change the world.
[00:03:50] And that's what makes this job so fun.
[00:03:55] You can think of this as buying low selling,
[00:03:58] hyping and investor, but I really just think about it.
[00:04:01] It is partnering with these great founders who want to go change the world.
[00:04:05] One of the notes that I learned from multiple founders about you,
[00:04:13] it comes from your operator builder, D&I.
[00:04:17] How do you help these companies build?
[00:04:19] I think it's very bespoke for each and every one of these founders.
[00:04:23] And in certain cases like Brian Cheskey doesn't need to be told how to tell a story.
[00:04:29] He's such a great storyteller.
[00:04:31] But you know, international expansion, sort of setting up operations,
[00:04:35] he may need more help on recruiting what to look for, etc. in the early days.
[00:04:40] With Tony Schoo, he's so good at looking at things from the highest level of detail
[00:04:45] all the way to the lowest level of detail.
[00:04:47] And I'll teach him that.
[00:04:48] But maybe certain things around how to think about breaking down a problem
[00:04:54] into smaller, smaller problems and tell the story behind the data.
[00:05:02] Every single founder comes at this problem of company building in a slightly different way
[00:05:08] because they have a certain set of skills.
[00:05:10] And I hopefully help them think about all the other skills
[00:05:14] that they want to learn and will improve themselves as a founder
[00:05:18] by evening out to all of the things that they want to learn along the way.
[00:05:23] With Kalshi, I don't have to teach him anything about regulatory.
[00:05:26] They're just experts at that.
[00:05:28] But you know, sort of product and then they're great engineers.
[00:05:32] But building the product, making the UI come to life,
[00:05:36] that took a bit of time because that wasn't something that they were used to.
[00:05:38] So for every founder, it's a little different.
[00:05:41] And that's what makes this job so much fun.
[00:05:43] Have you been to Kalshi's new headquarters?
[00:05:46] I have not been to their new office.
[00:05:48] I was at their old office where they had this big,
[00:05:51] celebratory thing during elections of last year.
[00:05:55] And it was just so fun for them to call the elections last year.
[00:05:59] I was definitely exciting in their office.
[00:06:01] They called it before all of the other national media outlets.
[00:06:08] So that was a ton of fun.
[00:06:10] They keep on doing that over and over and over again.
[00:06:12] Yeah, but that was the start.
[00:06:14] That was the start.
[00:06:15] You always remember the start of things.
[00:06:17] You know, the second or the third or the fourth is fun,
[00:06:24] not as interesting as the first.
[00:06:25] So between Kalshi and Kameer, I want to talk about both of those ones
[00:06:31] because they took a while to bake,
[00:06:34] but recently they both hit inflection points.
[00:06:37] And for you as an investor and an operator,
[00:06:41] I'm curious how you helped navigate those really,
[00:06:44] really long periods of time.
[00:06:45] Like when I had Tarek on the podcast,
[00:06:48] he said it was brutal.
[00:06:49] Like he wouldn't wish it upon his worst enemy.
[00:06:53] Like it was just a excruciating brutal process,
[00:06:56] but you were always supportive and pushing them along.
[00:07:00] So what was it like to get them to this point?
[00:07:03] And how do you support them now?
[00:07:04] How is it different?
[00:07:05] So I think the sort of natural tendency
[00:07:08] that every founder or investor thinks is like,
[00:07:12] oh, all these successes are overnight successiveness.
[00:07:14] It's just not true.
[00:07:16] Every founder has their journey and it's taken longer than they want.
[00:07:20] Even if one of the things go fast, it takes longer than they want.
[00:07:24] For those two companies,
[00:07:27] Athelas, Kameer, and then Kalshi,
[00:07:31] the stories are very, very different,
[00:07:33] even though it took a long time.
[00:07:35] Kalshi, the thing that they wanted to do
[00:07:39] was to be the first regulated events marketplace
[00:07:46] for an exchange.
[00:07:48] And that took a long time just to get the regulatory side
[00:07:52] to get work with the CFTC to get regulated.
[00:07:55] And once they did that, we invested in December of 2020
[00:08:00] when that happened.
[00:08:02] But even then, it took a bunch of time working with the CFTC
[00:08:05] to launch these events to sort of figure out
[00:08:09] how to sort of systematize it
[00:08:12] and so that they can launch more and more events over and over again
[00:08:16] in a more repeatable way.
[00:08:18] And so when they first started,
[00:08:19] it probably took 18 months to launch their first event
[00:08:22] and now it takes a matter of hours.
[00:08:25] That work is something that just takes effort.
[00:08:28] And you have to take this big problem and break it down
[00:08:31] and figure out how to make it repeatable.
[00:08:34] The first one is do things that don't scale.
[00:08:37] But over time, you have to figure out how to scale the process.
[00:08:40] And that's what we did there.
[00:08:42] And then we did small little p-pivots along the way.
[00:08:46] So we started with current events,
[00:08:49] then with economic indicators,
[00:08:54] and then the election,
[00:08:55] which we had to sort of work very hard to get,
[00:08:58] including deciding whether we would sue a regulator or a regulator.
[00:09:03] It's generally not a great aid to sue your regulator
[00:09:05] unless you have a really strong case.
[00:09:08] And there was a lot of thinking and back and forth
[00:09:11] about exactly what the calculus was on how we would win.
[00:09:14] And we thought we had a really strong case.
[00:09:16] And Tarak and Moana were fearless.
[00:09:19] And that's why they were able to propose
[00:09:23] that we sue our regulator of ours
[00:09:26] and to open up elections.
[00:09:30] And we won and then we pivoted small little p-pivots
[00:09:35] to elections, which was a big deal,
[00:09:37] then politics, other events along the way.
[00:09:40] And now there's a small little p-pivot to two sports.
[00:09:45] And along the way we are going to go event by event
[00:09:50] and the word caching means everything.
[00:09:53] So eventually they want to offer all sorts of event contracts
[00:09:58] where you can, if you have an inside, you can trade on.
[00:10:02] I hope I don't get in trouble by saying this.
[00:10:04] Both Teney and Tarak said throughout the time
[00:10:08] you've been very supportive.
[00:10:09] But now it seems like you understand,
[00:10:13] okay, we caught something and we have to go hard on it.
[00:10:16] And so the relationship is much more focused
[00:10:20] and a little bit more intense.
[00:10:22] How do you think about that?
[00:10:23] I think I've been pretty intense with them the whole time.
[00:10:26] They just don't realize it.
[00:10:28] I think this is a very sequer characteristic of board members.
[00:10:33] We partner with the founders and we know
[00:10:36] to be shock absorbers during bad times
[00:10:38] and to be sparring partners during good times.
[00:10:41] And so there's no point when the company is down.
[00:10:45] If something goes wrong, there is no point
[00:10:47] to beat someone when they're down.
[00:10:50] You actually, the best thing you can do
[00:10:51] is roll up your sleeves, pick up the pieces
[00:10:53] and help the company get through that hardship.
[00:10:56] And that's what we do at Sequoia.
[00:10:58] And then when things are going well,
[00:11:00] you want to be a sparring partner.
[00:11:02] You want to take things to the next level.
[00:11:05] You have something that's working.
[00:11:07] Well, it can work even better.
[00:11:10] And one of the things I always reflect on
[00:11:13] is companies when things are going well,
[00:11:15] they get low arrogance.
[00:11:17] And the first sign of why companies fail
[00:11:21] is the hubris of much success.
[00:11:23] That Jim Collins wrote a book.
[00:11:25] There was a small book about why the mighty fall.
[00:11:28] And the first sign is the hubris of much success.
[00:11:31] And the second is the undisciplined pursuit of more.
[00:11:35] Those things, when I see that, I try to nib it in the book.

[00:12:41] What are the key characteristics you look for in founders?
[00:12:44] Well, we talked a little bit about being an outlier and having us a spike.
[00:12:49] And for me, that's like number one.
[00:12:52] You just, we want people who are just off the charts,
[00:12:55] really good at something.
[00:12:57] And they have this like dream of building something
[00:13:00] that they've never, at the world, has never seen before.
[00:13:04] One of the things I really love doing is
[00:13:07] working with founders.
[00:13:09] And so I love to hear the unique and novel insights.
[00:13:13] I love to hear how deeply they've studied the market or the industry,
[00:13:19] even though they're an outsider.
[00:13:21] And I think they're founders.
[00:13:23] They're, they fall into three different buckets.
[00:13:25] There's the person who's a dreamer.
[00:13:28] They just can paint this beautiful vision of the future.
[00:13:31] And you just get enticed by that.
[00:13:33] And they're people who solve their own.
[00:13:35] They have a, they see a problem and they want to solve that problem.
[00:13:39] And I love riffing with them on that, on that particular problem.
[00:13:43] And then their founders were very technical.
[00:13:46] And they can describe the technology, but they're less good with
[00:13:52] explaining what the business is.
[00:13:55] And I try to help each of those three with in different ways.
[00:13:59] You'd mentioned lowercase p-pivits.
[00:14:04] Zoe, call it lowercase p-pivits.
[00:14:08] In my notes and research, you also have capital p-pivits.
[00:14:13] And for one of those, it was with zip lines.
[00:14:15] So what happened with zip line?
[00:14:17] And so there's this concept of the little p-pivits,
[00:14:19] and a couple of pivots. Pivots is like, you know, when Amazon went from books to music to that's
[00:14:26] like that's category expansion. You can kind of imagine that that would be all of e-commerce.
[00:14:32] Big pivots is like you're completely going out of e-commerce. And so Zipline, they started out
[00:14:38] with this idea of building a mobile platform for robotics where the iPhone was going to be the
[00:14:45] brains. And what they ended up with was what Keller would say was kind of like a toy. And people
[00:14:51] would play with it. They had fun with it. And then after a few days or a few weeks, they would
[00:14:56] put it back on the shelf. And it wasn't a very sticky product. And Keller went back to the drawing
[00:15:02] board and came back and said, you know what? I think what we want to build drones. And I'm like,
[00:15:08] what? You were building this mobile platform for robotics. Now you want to build drones.
[00:15:14] You don't know anything about drones. You don't have anything on the team that knows anything
[00:15:19] about how to make a drone. How are we going to do that? Oh, and by the way, we don't have any
[00:15:26] ability to fly drones beyond visual line of sight in the United States. What are we going to do?
[00:15:31] It's like, oh, well, I guess we need to fly outside the United States. Like, what?
[00:15:37] Okay. And by the way, like, why would anybody pay you? The system is going to be expensive
[00:15:43] to sort of get started. So why would anybody pay you to deliver anything? It's like, yeah,
[00:15:49] I think medical deliveries are really valuable. So we're going to start there. But we're going
[00:15:55] to start in Africa. We're going to start in a one that because the infrastructure there is
[00:16:03] pretty poor. The road infrastructure is just bad. We're going to be able to take blood from
[00:16:08] the central of Rwanda and fly it out to all these sort of remote places to save lives. I'm like,
[00:16:15] that's very interesting. That's a very big pivot from where you were before.
[00:16:21] But we talked through it and we tried to sort of reason through from first principles why this
[00:16:28] would work. But the whole idea was we're going to go out to Rwanda. We're going to prove out that
[00:16:33] we can do this. And then we can bring back all of the safety records to the US and eventually be
[00:16:41] allowed to fly in the US, which is what has happened now. And we're going to do a lot of deliveries
[00:16:47] in the US now. Did they relocate the business when they did that? Like the headquarters and everything?
[00:16:52] I didn't relocate the business, but Keller, I think spent a lot of time in Rwanda setting things up.
[00:16:59] I think he lived there for like three to six months, just for the first three to six months.
[00:17:03] Seems necessary. It seems it definitely was necessary. There are a lot of paralandings too. It
[00:17:10] wasn't perfect on day one. Did you go? Did you visit? I have not visited Rwanda yet.
[00:17:17] Okay, so we need to get you to Kalshi's headquarters and also to Rwanda.
[00:17:21] Kalshi's headquarters is going to see fun in New York this week. So I'll see them.
[00:17:27] We're leading a bunch of students from Harvard and MIT to their offices this week. So I'll see
[00:17:34] their offices soon. Some quants? I don't know if you can count them as quants quite yet. They haven't
[00:17:41] graduated. It's a little sort of college recruiting for both Kalshi and Clay.
[00:17:48] They've got a big they've got a big office they should fill up. So one of your earlier
[00:17:55] investments is DoorDash. There is something that you mentioned about DoorDash and this has to
[00:18:03] do with capital. It's not a strategic weapon, but efficiency is the weapon. So how do you think
[00:18:10] about when businesses are growing, what levers to pull? One of the things that we had to deal
[00:18:18] with at DoorDash was capital was plentiful and a lot of companies were funded during that time
[00:18:26] and a lot of competitors in the food delivery space was was funded.
[00:18:33] And you can either take this view that capital is a strategic weapon which some people have said
[00:18:39] or you can take a view that your business model is your strategic weapon, your product is your
[00:18:44] strategic weapon, your efficiency or your unit economics is your strategic weapon. And I've
[00:18:49] always taken that view which is why I've always told them hey you know we're not going to be all
[00:18:56] raised as much money as Uber. But we're still going to win because we're going to be twice as
[00:19:01] efficient and for every $100 that we spend acquiring customers we're going to get twice as many
[00:19:07] customers. If we can do that then you should you should really pour the capital in to the engine
[00:19:17] and let it fire. One of the things I've always sort of thought thought about was that capital
[00:19:23] and marketing dollars are really fuel but do you have a fire burning and if you have a fire burning
[00:19:30] really really hot you want to pour fuel on it. If you don't have a fire burning pouring fuel
[00:19:36] on the ground it's not going to burn. So I always tell founders let's get the fire going first
[00:19:43] get let's get your flywheel going first then pour fuel onto the fire fuel into your jet engine.
[00:19:49] How do you know when it's the right time I feel like they're from from some of the conversations
[00:19:54] I've had on this podcast marketing and marketing success can often mask actual product market fit.
[00:20:02] So how do you think about that when applying capital towards the saying goes growth covers all
[00:20:09] sins. But the problem is as soon as you stop growing or you stop pouring money or marketing into
[00:20:18] the engine you see all the things that are wrong with the company and at some level you have to be
[00:20:25] intellectually honest about what's going on. Do you actually have product market fits your question
[00:20:31] or are you just throwing money to get users. And to me you need to prime the pump let's get real
[00:20:40] like sometimes you just need to get some users and test it and so then you learn how to get better
[00:20:45] and better at building the product and that feeds back into product market fit. But when you don't
[00:20:51] have product market fit and you're hiding that fact with capital that's kind of a a defeatist
[00:20:57] way of building a company. You need to serve you intellectually honest with yourself.
[00:21:02] Often the data is very simple you just have to look at the engagement of your product. And we
[00:21:09] often think about things one of the sort of output metrics and Amazon taught us to think about
[00:21:15] the input metrics. The input metric is engagement then retention then monetization.
[00:21:21] And DoorDash did an extremely good job of like being focused on how many orders is the user
[00:21:28] actually order. How did they retain over time and then we can figure out how much we want to
[00:21:33] monetize and if we monetize them well we can spend more more capital to acquire them. There
[00:21:38] were a number of metrics that DoorDash tracked that were all about retention. They were very
[00:21:45] focused on making the retention curves, the cohort curves smile. And I think that was the reason
[00:21:51] for much of their success. One of the things that I think we forget is that startups are great
[00:22:03] at figuring out how to deliver value. And then after you deliver value then you want to capture
[00:22:10] value. And so the same is true with revenue. Let's figure out whether we deliver value first
[00:22:17] before we monetize it. We should talk about revenue. Revenue is a hot topic right now.
[00:22:24] The race to 100 million dollars in revenue has become somewhat of a standard metric.
[00:22:30] It's now the benchmark and whoever can get there the fastest apparently gets a gold star.
[00:22:36] So I'm curious from your standpoint how do you think about this overall concept of getting to
[00:22:41] 100 million dollars in revenue. And I guess the through line or underneath that there are
[00:22:48] categorically companies that are pushing that. So maybe we can break that down a bit too.
[00:22:52] But how do you think about race to revenue and getting these benchmarks for early stage companies?
[00:22:58] In today's high speed business world staying ahead means using the smartest tools possible,
[00:23:03] including the powerful capabilities of artificial intelligence, meet Turing intelligence.

[00:23:24] business growth. To learn more visit Turing.com slash sorcery spelt s o u r c e r y that's
[00:23:32] Turing.com slash sorcery. It is a very important topic because again I think financial metrics
[00:23:39] revenue as a financial metric is an output metric. And the health of the business is not just the
[00:23:45] output metric but it's a bunch of input metrics. And I you know as a poor member
[00:23:55] a way to summarize how well the company is doing is just to show you the financials and not show
[00:24:00] you any of the input metrics. And I think they go hand in hand. And if you think about there's
[00:24:06] inputs there is the company and then there's output. And how what how efficiently you're taking the
[00:24:13] inputs to produce outputs that's the throughput of the company. And that's what the founders make
[00:24:21] sure that there's high throughput the management team the employees make sure there's high throughput.
[00:24:26] I think you need to measure all three of those. This idea that we have we can just get to 100
[00:24:32] million dollars in revenue to realize the fact that you know that's the goal. And yet I think
[00:24:39] quality of the revenue matters. That's why you know one time revenue is not seen as good as
[00:24:45] subscription revenue. And that's why SaaS companies trade differently than software companies
[00:24:51] because software companies one time license. And yet they're not valued as well as a subscription
[00:24:59] company like a SaaS company. And so the quality of revenue really really matters. And so I prefer
[00:25:05] to have slower growth quality revenue than fast growth, non-quality revenue. And today I think
[00:25:12] there are a lot of revenue that is experimental revenue. People are willing to experiment because
[00:25:18] they don't want to be left behind in AI. And that's good and bad. It's great for founders. They
[00:25:23] get to finance some of the their R&D with revenue. It's bad because it's pilot revenue and make
[00:25:31] go away. So you need to figure out with that revenue, are you going to retain that customer? Retention
[00:25:38] is so important. And so you can get a hundred million. And then if you turn all of it, you're going
[00:25:43] to go back to zero pretty quickly. Can you explain experimental revenue a little bit more? Like
[00:25:50] are teams aware it's experimental? Or is it just we're going to try out different business lines?
[00:25:55] I think the teams are where they hide the fact that it's experimental. Pilot revenue is experimental.
[00:26:02] Right. So would you like to sign up for this pilot? If the pilot goes well, we'll sign a larger
[00:26:07] contract. That's very standard thing that has happened in enterprise sales. You go in, it's like,
[00:26:14] this is a new product. You've never used this before. Why don't you try it? And if we can hit a
[00:26:22] bunch of RRI metrics, then the customer will say, okay, well, you hit a bunch of RRI metrics. I'm
[00:26:28] going to extend. And so the counting pilot revenue and counting it as ARR and annualizing it is
[00:26:37] kind of a joke, which I think a lot of founders know it's a joke, but they don't have any prongs
[00:26:44] just taking whatever month's revenue is that's all pilot revenue and multiplying by 12.
[00:26:51] But they you're laughing. You know it's good joke, but they do it anyway. And we call it ARR.
[00:26:57] Like as if it was recurring. Yeah. What are the other types of revenue that people claim to be
[00:27:02] revenue? I think it's it would be good. It would be clarifying to just list out all the different
[00:27:06] ways in which people claim they have revenue. I'm not saying this is like a getcha for anybody,
[00:27:12] but like I think it would be helpful for founders and even some maybe younger investors understand
[00:27:19] the difference between like actual revenue versus these different kinds of pilot revenue,
[00:27:24] etc. That people are calling. Yeah. So there's pilot revenue. There is and so that isn't really
[00:27:32] long-term revenue. You got to be honest with yourself. There's revenue where you get a revenue
[00:27:37] share and you tell people your gross revenue, not your net revenue. And you know in the marketplace
[00:27:44] business, the GMV versus your take your take is like five to 10% and you're you're you're talking
[00:27:51] about GMV. That was done a lot in the marketplaces companies. You're you know the there are plenty
[00:27:59] of examples where customers you have a high turn rate. So 30% of your customers turn and you
[00:28:10] want to just count this month as ARR when you know that 30% of them are going to turn. So the quality
[00:28:15] of the revenue is not very good. There's professional services revenue. You were getting paid to do
[00:28:19] professional services, but it's not product revenue. It's one time and it is revenue. You get paid
[00:28:25] but it will disappear. There's the subscription and hardware revenue. People if you buy peloton,
[00:28:32] there's the peloton machine and then there's the subscription revenue. We value the subscription
[00:28:36] revenue way more than the hardware revenue because the hardware revenue is one time and it's low
[00:28:42] gross margin. Whereas the subscription revenue of peloton is high gross margin. So there are all
[00:28:48] these little things and little tricks. And I think it's not trying to be devious or anything, but
[00:28:57] we don't sort of break out all these different revenue into into these different parts. And
[00:29:05] if you want to be intellectually honest, you would want to break out all these different parts to
[00:29:10] be intellectually honest about the health of your business. And my partner Pat always talks about
[00:29:15] what are the numbers behind the numbers? And the better the founder is the better the management
[00:29:23] team on understanding the numbers behind the numbers, the more levers they're going to have,
[00:29:28] the more understanding they're going to have in the business.
[00:29:30] One of the undercurrents for all of this is the increased competition within startups with AI,
[00:29:36] this hype cycle if you want to call it that. Things are moving so much faster than anyone could
[00:29:42] have ever expected. And there is pressure to perform and to to keep up with everyone else.
[00:29:51] More recently, I don't know if you saw this, but there was and this was really interesting because
[00:29:54] there was a lot of backlash on it. But Haman was on 20 VC and they were talking about the standard
[00:30:03] triple triple double double. And Haman was saying like, no, it's we actually expect more than that
[00:30:09] now because of what they're seeing at General Catalyst. And on Twitter, founders didn't like to hear
[00:30:16] that other people didn't like to hear that. I would assume you don't like to hear that based on
[00:30:20] what you mentioned earlier, you'd rather have sustainable quality growth than something really,
[00:30:26] really fast. But what do you think that means for the overall context of where we are right now in
[00:30:32] the technology cycle of companies feeling the pressure to grow as fast as possible. And then also
[00:30:41] these really, really large VCs now expecting that. So let me separate two parts of your question
[00:30:48] because I think it's a very, very important question. Sorcery is proudly sponsored by Carta.

[00:31:37] accelerating change. Things are moving faster today than 10 years ago. 10 years ago, things
[00:31:43] were moving faster than 10 years before that. And part of that means that founders today have a
[00:31:52] harder job than founders a decade ago. That's just the price of progress. And so there is an
[00:31:59] element of truth that we expect more of this generation. And by the way, why? Well, 10 years ago,
[00:32:07] we didn't have all of these customers on mobile on every single device connected to broadband
[00:32:14] everywhere around the world. Your ability to reach customers today is just a lot easier than
[00:32:21] 10 years ago, 10 years before that. When I started, I was still building PCs and computers in
[00:32:29] junior high school and high school because clone IBM PCs were expensive. So people wanted to buy
[00:32:35] clone PCs and you put them together. You don't need to do that today. You buy like full
[00:32:41] service. Oh, no, you don't need to put servers into a rack. You just go on AWS or GCP or Azure and
[00:32:49] you just provision a server. And so and you don't have to set it up anymore with foundation models,
[00:32:56] they're they're bundled up. And so things are just a lot easier today in some respects,
[00:33:03] which means it's a lot harder in other respects. And it's a lot harder to to get
[00:33:10] above the fray because once you launch and you have any success, 15 competitors show up.
[00:33:17] And that was true 15 years ago, but it's way worse now. When DoorDash launched,
[00:33:21] there was a lot of competitors, but today, you know, if you launch an AI company and it has some
[00:33:28] semblance of success, there's going to be a lot of competitors. At the same time, I think revenue
[00:33:34] as the metric is is a lazy way of looking at the problem. You have to look at the underlying
[00:33:43] metrics. And don't forget, some of the best companies in the world over time have taken time to
[00:33:47] build before they reach revenue. Part of it is to become future parity. Figma just won public
[00:33:54] recently. It took a long time for them to be on the same feature parity with Photoshop.
[00:34:01] But it was collaborative is obviously going to be the next generation on how you sort of
[00:34:06] collaborate with designers. You can do it on the web instead of like walking over to designers
[00:34:13] desktop and seeing what they designed. But at the same time, it took time to build the product
[00:34:19] in the product surface area. And so the measurements should be about the velocity of the company,
[00:34:29] not just revenue growth. Hey, it's Molly. If you injured interviews, check out our newsletter
