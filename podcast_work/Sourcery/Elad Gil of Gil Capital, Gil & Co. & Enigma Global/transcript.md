[00:00:00] **Elad Gil:** I was looking a little bit at the data from the 90s because I thought we're in this weird moment in time in AI.
[00:00:04] **Elad Gil:** What did the internet version look like?
[00:00:06] **Elad Gil:** It spans the globe like a super high one.
[00:00:08] **Elad Gil:** It is called Internet.
[00:00:10] **Elad Gil:** That is a whole group of networks.
[00:00:12] **Elad Gil:** Do you know how many companies in public in 99?
[00:00:14] **Molly O'Shea:** 200.
[00:00:15] **Elad Gil:** It was close, 450.
[00:00:16] **Elad Gil:** And then if you look at the first part of 2000,
[00:00:19] **Elad Gil:** another 450 or so companies in public.
[00:00:21] **Elad Gil:** And then before that, I'm guessing another 1000 internet companies in public.
[00:00:24] **Molly O'Shea:** How many of those are relevant now?
[00:00:26] **Molly O'Shea:** Or even exist?
[00:00:27] **Elad Gil:** I think one interesting ship that's happened is there may be a subset of companies that are forever private
[00:00:31] **Elad Gil:** because it can afford to be.
[00:00:33] **Elad Gil:** That may be Stripe, that may be SpaceX, that may be some other companies.
[00:00:36] **Elad Gil:** I don't know if you remember the direct listing wave of like 2020 or whenever all these companies start doing DLs
[00:00:41] **Elad Gil:** and it was considered the next big thing and then like five companies did it.
[00:00:44] **Molly O'Shea:** Right?
[00:00:45] **Elad Gil:** I think it's quite possible that this forever private thing will be similar.
[00:00:48] **Elad Gil:** And then I think there's a bunch of companies that will just do the normal IPO thing and all the rest of it.
[00:00:52] **Elad Gil:** And it's interesting to ask like what percentage of future market cap
[00:00:55] **Elad Gil:** will be these perpetually private companies versus not.
[00:00:57] **Elad Gil:** And will they eventually go public?
[00:00:59] **Elad Gil:** The HubSpot CEO tweeted out if you want to sell your company selling now.
[00:01:02] **Elad Gil:** I think that's always true.
[00:01:15] **Molly O'Shea:** Elad, Elad.
[00:01:17] **Elad Gil:** Molly, Molly.
[00:01:18] **Molly O'Shea:** Welcome to Sorcery.
[00:01:19] **Elad Gil:** Thanks for having me.
[00:01:20] **Molly O'Shea:** Okay, so I have like two sets of questions.
[00:01:23] **Molly O'Shea:** One is the fun route and one is the serious route.
[00:01:26] **Elad Gil:** Oh, which one do you choose?
[00:01:28] **Molly O'Shea:** I don't know.
[00:01:29] **Molly O'Shea:** Maybe the fun route.
[00:01:31] **Molly O'Shea:** We're going to the serious route.
[00:01:32] **Elad Gil:** It's up to you.
[00:01:33] **Elad Gil:** I mean, it's your it's your podcast.
[00:01:35] **Elad Gil:** It's your choice.
[00:01:35] **Elad Gil:** It's your choice.
[00:01:37] **Molly O'Shea:** It feels like a very loaded choice.
[00:01:39] **Molly O'Shea:** Like if you choose a fun route but then you're not actually that fun.
[00:01:42] **Elad Gil:** You're having a much fun.
[00:01:42] **Molly O'Shea:** People will be like, oh, that person isn't fun.
[00:01:45] **Elad Gil:** So the serious route is actually the safer route.
[00:01:46] **Elad Gil:** But it sounds as fun.
[00:01:48] **Molly O'Shea:** What if I told you I only prepared one?
[00:01:50] **Molly O'Shea:** Let's do the serious route.
[00:01:52] **Elad Gil:** That sounds amazing.
[00:01:53] **Elad Gil:** Let's go.
[00:01:54] **Molly O'Shea:** Okay, so doing some deep research on you.
[00:01:57] **Molly O'Shea:** You have had a very interesting, unexpected career.
[00:02:03] **Molly O'Shea:** Google, Twitter, color genomics.
[00:02:07] **Molly O'Shea:** You then wrote a book.
[00:02:10] **Molly O'Shea:** Then you were one of the first AI investors.
[00:02:13] **Molly O'Shea:** And you have a podcast now.
[00:02:16] **Molly O'Shea:** You're doing incubations.
[00:02:17] **Molly O'Shea:** You also have a very successful fund.
[00:02:21] **Molly O'Shea:** So how did you do all this?
[00:02:25] **Elad Gil:** Yeah, I mean, I guess I've just been around for a while.
[00:02:27] **Elad Gil:** So these things accumulate with time.
[00:02:32] **Elad Gil:** I don't know if there's much more than that.
[00:02:33] **Elad Gil:** I think the honest answer is,
[00:02:37] **Elad Gil:** I have sort of a broader set of things that guide me in terms of
[00:02:41] **Elad Gil:** I view technology as a force for good.
[00:02:43] **Elad Gil:** I think it has helped raise,
[00:02:45] **Elad Gil:** elevate hundreds of millions of people.
[00:02:46] **Elad Gil:** Out of poverty, out of famine, out of all sorts of things.
[00:02:48] **Elad Gil:** I mean, technology in a broad way.
[00:02:50] **Elad Gil:** Right, technology is the agricultural revolution.
[00:02:53] **Elad Gil:** It's new medicines.
[00:02:55] **Elad Gil:** It's biotech.
[00:02:55] **Elad Gil:** It's running water.
[00:02:58] **Elad Gil:** It's all sorts of things.
[00:02:59] **Elad Gil:** And so when I look at the impact that's had on humanity,
[00:03:02] **Elad Gil:** it's been very positive.
[00:03:02] **Elad Gil:** And obviously, there's always the negative things that can happen.
[00:03:04] **Elad Gil:** All the rest of my thing has been very net positive.
[00:03:07] **Elad Gil:** And so throughout my career, I've kind of asked myself,
[00:03:10] **Elad Gil:** where do I think technology can be most valuable,
[00:03:12] **Elad Gil:** most useful?
[00:03:12] **Elad Gil:** How can I help transfer it in the world?
[00:03:14] **Elad Gil:** And so that's driven a lot of the choices
[00:03:16] **Elad Gil:** that were to be and what to work on.
[00:03:17] **Elad Gil:** And how to get involved with things.
[00:03:20] **Molly O'Shea:** Not to mention monuments.
[00:03:22] **Elad Gil:** And monuments.
[00:03:23] **Elad Gil:** And so, yeah, I'm working on a project now to try and build
[00:03:26] **Elad Gil:** a series of new monuments.
[00:03:27] **Elad Gil:** So if you look at every society that's at Apex,
[00:03:31] **Elad Gil:** ultimately,
[00:03:33] **Elad Gil:** has built large public art to inspire the next generation
[00:03:36] **Elad Gil:** to move forward for progress.
[00:03:38] **Elad Gil:** Maybe it captures its ethical values.
[00:03:40] **Elad Gil:** Maybe it captures its ambition.
[00:03:42] **Elad Gil:** And I think the last time we built a large scale monument
[00:03:44] **Elad Gil:** was Mount Rushmore, which was initiated in the 20s
[00:03:48] **Elad Gil:** and was built up until the early 40s.
[00:03:50] **Elad Gil:** And then since that time, we really haven't done anything,
[00:03:52] **Elad Gil:** societally, at least in the US.
[00:03:53] **Elad Gil:** Maybe you could argue the sphere in Las Vegas
[00:03:55] **Elad Gil:** is almost like a monument of some sort, right?
[00:03:59] **Elad Gil:** But we used to do these really big symbols.
[00:04:01] **Elad Gil:** And the Statue of Liberty, which was obviously a gift
[00:04:04] **Elad Gil:** as a great example of that.
[00:04:05] **Elad Gil:** You'd get off of Ellis Island as an immigrant,
[00:04:06] **Elad Gil:** and you'd be inspired by this giant statue
[00:04:11] **Elad Gil:** and this symbolic nature of like Liberty and Freedom
[00:04:13] **Elad Gil:** and this new land that you've come to.
[00:04:16] **Elad Gil:** And so we're working on doing monuments
[00:04:20] **Elad Gil:** or public art across four or five key cities in the US.
[00:04:25] **Elad Gil:** And we've been talking with different both artists
[00:04:28] **Elad Gil:** and artisans around different materials
[00:04:29] **Elad Gil:** so we've experimented with different bronze works.
[00:04:32] **Elad Gil:** We've experimented with marble.
[00:04:33] **Elad Gil:** We're actually looking at carbon fiber,
[00:04:34] **Elad Gil:** which nobody's really used,
[00:04:35] **Elad Gil:** which you think is really interesting for all sorts of reasons.
[00:04:37] **Elad Gil:** And then we've provided proposals to a few places already
[00:04:42] **Elad Gil:** in terms of some of the public art that we could build.
[00:04:44] **Elad Gil:** And I think the smaller scale of what we want to do
[00:04:46] **Elad Gil:** is probably 15 to 20 feet tall,
[00:04:48] **Elad Gil:** which is kind of the scale of the Atlas
[00:04:49] **Elad Gil:** in front of Rockefeller Center,
[00:04:52] **Elad Gil:** which I think is a beautiful work.
[00:04:54] **Elad Gil:** And then the hope is to eventually do something,
[00:04:56] **Elad Gil:** at least one that's sort of Statue of Liberty
[00:04:58] **Elad Gil:** or Eiffel Tower scale.

[00:06:01] **Molly O'Shea:** How do you make something not so polarizing in today's world?
[00:06:07] **Elad Gil:** I don't know.
[00:06:08] **Elad Gil:** I mean, in yester years' world,
[00:06:11] **Elad Gil:** these things were polarizing.
[00:06:12] **Elad Gil:** So the Eiffel Tower was considered very ugly when it was built.
[00:06:15] **Elad Gil:** It was a giant steel work.
[00:06:17] **Elad Gil:** And Eiffel was actually a bridge maker.
[00:06:20] **Elad Gil:** And he had all these divots and pieces of steel.
[00:06:22] **Elad Gil:** He's like, I'm going to make a big thing for the world fair
[00:06:25] **Elad Gil:** in the late 1800s.
[00:06:27] **Elad Gil:** And it was actually a mentorship for steelmaking.
[00:06:30] **Elad Gil:** It was an ode to technology progress.
[00:06:32] **Elad Gil:** And apparently a big chunk of the city thought it was ugly and terrible.
[00:06:36] **Elad Gil:** And they were looking for it.
[00:06:37] **Elad Gil:** They're getting torn down.
[00:06:39] **Elad Gil:** And so I think these things that we now view as beautiful and iconic
[00:06:43] **Elad Gil:** and inspiring and wonderful at the time were not viewed that way.
[00:06:46] **Elad Gil:** And one thing that I thought was really cool.
[00:06:47] **Elad Gil:** I went to see the Eiffel Tower actually recently.
[00:06:49] **Elad Gil:** It's sort of a refresher over the summer.
[00:06:51] **Elad Gil:** And he had his office on one of the top floors.
[00:06:54] **Elad Gil:** And it was a power move for him to invite people to his office.
[00:06:57] **Elad Gil:** And they would take the pneumatic lift.
[00:06:58] **Elad Gil:** I don't know if you've been in it.
[00:06:59] **Elad Gil:** It's a very quiet elevator that was built 150 years ago
[00:07:03] **Elad Gil:** using modern technology right of the day.
[00:07:06] **Elad Gil:** And so the elevator takes you up there and you get in and you go into his little office.
[00:07:09] **Elad Gil:** And they still have the desk and everything set up.
[00:07:11] **Elad Gil:** And it was him showing off.
[00:07:13] **Elad Gil:** Like what he built, which I thought was kind of neat.
[00:07:15] **Molly O'Shea:** I'm curious what happens.
[00:07:19] **Molly O'Shea:** Because it's a versus go.
[00:07:20] **Molly O'Shea:** Do you remember that statue?
[00:07:22] **Molly O'Shea:** Is that still up?
[00:07:23] **Elad Gil:** Which one?
[00:07:23] **Molly O'Shea:** The woman one in front of the Embarcadera?
[00:07:26] **Elad Gil:** No, I'm not sure if it's still up.
[00:07:27] **Elad Gil:** They also used to do a lot of Burning Man art in his valley.
[00:07:30] **Elad Gil:** And if you remember, they'd bring art from Burning Man
[00:07:32] **Elad Gil:** or right before they take it to the burn.
[00:07:33] **Elad Gil:** And they put that up there.
[00:07:35] **Elad Gil:** But there's a lot of temporary art still.
[00:07:38] **Elad Gil:** And so there's some in San Francisco.
[00:07:39] **Elad Gil:** There's some in New York periodically.
[00:07:41] **Elad Gil:** They'll sort of do some public works.
[00:07:44] **Elad Gil:** There's a little bit of Miami sometimes.
[00:07:46] **Elad Gil:** But I'd really like to move to big permanent installations
[00:07:49] **Elad Gil:** that have meaning that hopefully can transcend a really long time period.
[00:07:53] **Elad Gil:** Hundreds of years, you know, you want the thing to be relevant.
[00:07:56] **Elad Gil:** 200 years from now.
[00:07:57] **Elad Gil:** And so then you ask the question of, okay,
[00:07:58] **Elad Gil:** what are society relevant themes over long periods of time?
[00:08:02] **Elad Gil:** And what is actually forms of beauty
[00:08:04] **Elad Gil:** that we will agree 200 years from now is still beautiful?
[00:08:07] **Elad Gil:** Because if you look at a lot of postmodernism
[00:08:09] **Elad Gil:** and a lot of architecture,
[00:08:10] **Elad Gil:** I don't think it's that attractive anymore.
[00:08:12] **Elad Gil:** Right?
[00:08:12] **Elad Gil:** And there are things that are still beautiful, right?
[00:08:14] **Elad Gil:** Gothic periods and art.go.
[00:08:17] **Elad Gil:** And you know, there's all sorts of people still
[00:08:19] **Elad Gil:** love seeing Roman ruins because they're so beautiful.
[00:08:22] **Elad Gil:** Right?
[00:08:22] **Elad Gil:** Even though they're ruins.
[00:08:24] **Elad Gil:** So I think there's some things that feel like they're universal
[00:08:26] **Elad Gil:** and there's some things that seem like they're a moment of time
[00:08:28] **Elad Gil:** from an art or architecture perspective.
[00:08:30] **Molly O'Shea:** What do you think of?
[00:08:31] **Molly O'Shea:** Is it Bezos that has the clock's sculpture?
[00:08:34] **Elad Gil:** Yeah.
[00:08:34] **Elad Gil:** Oh, yeah, he has the, basically,
[00:08:36] **Elad Gil:** he tried to build a clock that would last for millennia.
[00:08:40] **Elad Gil:** And I think it's very cool conceptually.
[00:08:42] **Elad Gil:** I think it's really neat that he did that and he was thinking big.
[00:08:45] **Elad Gil:** I think the hard part is it's kind of isolated.
[00:08:47] **Elad Gil:** You kind of have to go out to get to it.
[00:08:49] **Elad Gil:** And so what I'm interested in is,
[00:08:51] **Elad Gil:** can you do these societally inspiring things?
[00:08:53] **Elad Gil:** But in major cities and major thoroughfares,
[00:08:56] **Elad Gil:** like how can you be central to where people are spending time?
[00:08:59] **Elad Gil:** Because if people don't see it, it kind of doesn't matter, you know?
[00:09:02] **Molly O'Shea:** As a multi-dimensional person,
[00:09:05] **Molly O'Shea:** you have culture, you have investing, you have technology and science.
[00:09:09] **Molly O'Shea:** On the investing standpoint,
[00:09:10] **Molly O'Shea:** you started off with angel investing.
[00:09:13] **Elad Gil:** Sure.
[00:09:13] **Molly O'Shea:** Currently, you're going to have a big fun soon.
[00:09:15] **Elad Gil:** Yeah.
[00:09:16] **Molly O'Shea:** How did we get here?
[00:09:17] **Molly O'Shea:** Like, so what was the arc from angel investing to this fund?
[00:09:20] **Molly O'Shea:** Because the strategy is insane.
[00:09:24] **Molly O'Shea:** Like, you're doing seed and precede and incubations,
[00:09:28] **Molly O'Shea:** but you're also leading $100 million series fees.
[00:09:33] **Elad Gil:** Yeah.
[00:09:33] **Elad Gil:** I think, um, basically, we've yourselves
[00:09:35] **Elad Gil:** investing from incubation or precede through pre-IPO.
[00:09:38] **Elad Gil:** And at this point,
[00:09:40] **Elad Gil:** have done every stage and have done very large investments.
[00:09:43] **Elad Gil:** So I think we've now led a few rounds
[00:09:46] **Elad Gil:** that are a half billion plus each.
[00:09:48] **Elad Gil:** And, um, you know, ultimately,
[00:09:51] **Elad Gil:** the starting point to your original question was,
[00:09:53] **Elad Gil:** I was just investing my own money as an angel
[00:09:57] **Elad Gil:** and I ran out of money.
[00:09:58] **Elad Gil:** Like, literally, I just, I ran out of money
[00:09:59] **Elad Gil:** because I put all my money to startups.
[00:10:02] **Elad Gil:** And so I started raising SPVs,
[00:10:04] **Elad Gil:** which are these single investment funds, right?
[00:10:07] **Elad Gil:** You raised money to invest in a specific company.
[00:10:10] **Elad Gil:** And that was really tough for a couple of years.
[00:10:11] **Elad Gil:** Like, nobody had heard of me.
[00:10:13] **Elad Gil:** It was very unusual for a single person to go and raise funds.
[00:10:16] **Elad Gil:** Um, and I was, I was involved with a lot of the key companies
[00:10:20] **Elad Gil:** who kept giving me bigger and bigger allocations,
[00:10:22] **Elad Gil:** like a stripe or other companies.
[00:10:23] **Elad Gil:** And I just couldn't, I just didn't have the money.
[00:10:26] **Elad Gil:** And so I skipped together the first few of those.
[00:10:29] **Elad Gil:** And then the LPs and those eventually asked me to,
[00:10:32] **Elad Gil:** if I wanted to do a standalone sort of fund.
[00:10:35] **Elad Gil:** And I kept angel investing alongside that.
[00:10:37] **Elad Gil:** And now I kind of do a mix of,
[00:10:39] **Elad Gil:** if I can still do personal investments,
[00:10:40] **Elad Gil:** I can do things through the funds,
[00:10:41] **Elad Gil:** I can do incubations, you know, it's, it's kind of
[00:10:44] **Elad Gil:** multifaceted.
[00:10:44] **Elad Gil:** And to your point, we even do things now,
[00:10:46] **Elad Gil:** like AI driven rollups, right?
[00:10:47] **Elad Gil:** So we'll help actually fund entrepreneur founder
[00:10:51] **Elad Gil:** who wants to go and consolidate an industry
[00:10:52] **Elad Gil:** or buy into different traditional businesses
[00:10:54] **Elad Gil:** and then, you know, modernize them with AI.
[00:10:56] **Molly O'Shea:** How do you think about the categories?
[00:10:59] **Molly O'Shea:** Because you're investing in many different things.
[00:11:01] **Molly O'Shea:** As a solo GP, by the way.
[00:11:03] **Elad Gil:** Yeah, well, I'm going to have a small team,
[00:11:04] **Elad Gil:** but how big is the team?
[00:11:05] **Elad Gil:** Uh, on the investment side,
[00:11:07] **Elad Gil:** I have four people who are helping me.
[00:11:09] **Elad Gil:** And then I have about another six, seven people helping
[00:11:13] **Elad Gil:** with back office and finance.
[00:11:14] **Elad Gil:** And, you know, I tend to have always thought
[00:11:17] **Elad Gil:** that it's really important to ensure
[00:11:18] **Elad Gil:** that you're properly focused on compliance and accounting.
[00:11:21] **Elad Gil:** And, you know, I'm very paranoid about doing things properly.
[00:11:25] **Elad Gil:** And I'm always paranoid about fraud
[00:11:27] **Elad Gil:** or other things that can really be existential to a business.
[00:11:29] **Elad Gil:** And so I view that in the context of what I do as well,
[00:11:31] **Elad Gil:** like, is really important to get right.
[00:11:33] **Elad Gil:** So I have a whole team just dedicated to, you know,
[00:11:35] **Elad Gil:** accounting and finance.
[00:11:36] **Elad Gil:** And then I have other people helping
[00:11:38] **Elad Gil:** with a few other areas of events and, you know, things like that.
[00:11:41] **Elad Gil:** You know, it's interesting that there's sort of two approaches
[00:11:44] **Elad Gil:** to investing.
[00:11:45] **Elad Gil:** One approach to investing is to say that
[00:11:47] **Elad Gil:** you're going to be thesis driven
[00:11:48] **Elad Gil:** and you're going to look for specific things.
[00:11:51] **Elad Gil:** And then the other approach is you're just opportunistic
[00:11:53] **Elad Gil:** and you wait for the best things to show up.
[00:11:55] **Elad Gil:** And the argument for the first one is
[00:11:57] **Elad Gil:** every once in a while there's a sea change
[00:11:58] **Elad Gil:** or a shift in technology that's so important
[00:12:00] **Elad Gil:** that it makes sense to just go looking.
[00:12:02] **Elad Gil:** And so two examples of that.
[00:12:03] **Elad Gil:** In my career, I've been crypto.
[00:12:04] **Elad Gil:** We're in 2016, 2017.
[00:12:07] **Elad Gil:** I just started doing a lot of crypto investing
[00:12:08] **Elad Gil:** because it was such a clear sea change.
[00:12:10] **Elad Gil:** And I wish I'd obviously started earlier.
[00:12:12] **Elad Gil:** But that's when I invested in Coinbase
[00:12:13] **Elad Gil:** and other companies in that area.
[00:12:16] **Elad Gil:** And then I think more recently
[00:12:18] **Elad Gil:** with the generative AI wave,
[00:12:21] **Elad Gil:** I ended up getting involved with that quite early, 2021, 2022.
[00:12:25] **Elad Gil:** And that was, you know, I played with GPT-2
[00:12:28] **Elad Gil:** and then GPT-3 and it was a shoot step function up.
[00:12:30] **Elad Gil:** And all the scaling papers were out
[00:12:32] **Elad Gil:** and you could just read them
[00:12:33] **Elad Gil:** and see that all the stuff was coming.
[00:12:34] **Elad Gil:** And so I just started looking for people working in the area.
[00:12:36] **Elad Gil:** And so that's when I funded
[00:12:38] **Elad Gil:** perplexity and Harvey and eventually
[00:12:40] **Elad Gil:** Decagon in a bridge and a bunch of other companies.
[00:12:43] **Elad Gil:** And so that was a little bit thesis-driven.
[00:12:46] **Elad Gil:** Like, hey, I think this big change is happening.
[00:12:47] **Elad Gil:** So let me just see who's doing what there
[00:12:49] **Elad Gil:** and very few people were looking.
[00:12:51] **Elad Gil:** But there's a lot of companies I invested in simply
[00:12:52] **Elad Gil:** because I met the founders
[00:12:54] **Elad Gil:** and I thought it was a really great company.
[00:12:55] **Elad Gil:** You know, that was Airbnb and that was Stripe
[00:12:57] **Elad Gil:** and that was Figma and that was Instacard
[00:13:00] **Elad Gil:** and, you know, Notion and all.
[00:13:02] **Elad Gil:** And so I think some of these things
[00:13:04] **Elad Gil:** in hindsight feel like trends.
[00:13:06] **Elad Gil:** You know, oh, there was a Fintech wave.
[00:13:08] **Elad Gil:** You know, in Fintech I did Stripe Square affirm Brax.
[00:13:12] **Elad Gil:** But I wasn't like, I'm a Fintech investor.
[00:13:14] **Elad Gil:** I just thought it was like an important set of companies
[00:13:16] **Elad Gil:** and then in hindsight, oh yeah, of course,
[00:13:17] **Elad Gil:** there was this wave that was happening.
[00:13:19] **Elad Gil:** So, you know, I think in general,
[00:13:21] **Elad Gil:** there's thousands of great founders out there
[00:13:23] **Elad Gil:** and you could think of them as a distributed search function.
[00:13:26] **Elad Gil:** You have thousands of people exploring
[00:13:27] **Elad Gil:** all the space of entrepreneurship.
[00:13:29] **Elad Gil:** And so how can any one person or small group of people
[00:13:31] **Elad Gil:** come up with better ideas and thousands of people
[00:13:33] **Elad Gil:** in a distributed manner?
[00:13:34] **Elad Gil:** You know, it's just impossible.
[00:13:36] **Elad Gil:** But everyone's, while there's a technology
[00:13:37] **Elad Gil:** shift and if you notice it, you can,
[00:13:39] **Elad Gil:** you can really get involved with important things.
[00:13:40] **Molly O'Shea:** How many companies have you invested in?
[00:13:42] **Elad Gil:** Um, I don't know the exact number.
[00:13:44] **Elad Gil:** So I've invested and say, um,
[00:13:47] **Elad Gil:** I'm making up the number 10 to 15 companies a year
[00:13:49] **Elad Gil:** but I've been doing it for 15 years.
[00:13:51] **Elad Gil:** So that's between 150 to 225 if you use that as an estimate
[00:13:54] **Elad Gil:** over like a really long time span.
[00:13:56] **Elad Gil:** So many of those are now sold or public
[00:13:58] **Elad Gil:** or dead or, you know, all the various things
[00:14:01] **Elad Gil:** that can happen to a company.
[00:14:02] **Molly O'Shea:** Can you name all of them?
[00:14:04] **Elad Gil:** Oh yeah, of course.
[00:14:05] **Elad Gil:** I can actually do it alphabetically
[00:14:06] **Elad Gil:** and then reverse alphabetically.
[00:14:07] **Molly O'Shea:** Are you serious?
[00:14:08] **Elad Gil:** No, no.
[00:14:09] **Molly O'Shea:** Yeah, no.
[00:14:09] **Molly O'Shea:** Oh, come on.
[00:14:10] **Elad Gil:** I think I've, yeah.
[00:14:11] **Elad Gil:** So.
[00:14:12] **Molly O'Shea:** Wow, I was really excited there.
[00:14:14] **Elad Gil:** Yeah, I would have been a very long episode.
[00:14:16] **Elad Gil:** Would have been great.
[00:14:16] **Elad Gil:** Let's start to get bored.
[00:14:17] **Elad Gil:** They'd be like, oh, he's on the S's now.
[00:14:19] **Elad Gil:** It's always over slider.
[00:14:20] **Molly O'Shea:** So many S's.
[00:14:21] **Molly O'Shea:** It would make a good clip.
[00:14:24] **Molly O'Shea:** I just released that on Twitter.
[00:14:25] **Elad Gil:** Yeah, that'd be really.
[00:14:26] **Molly O'Shea:** He's still going.
[00:14:27] **Molly O'Shea:** It's so viral.
[00:14:28] **Elad Gil:** I feel like, oh my god, the T's,
[00:14:30] **Elad Gil:** the T's in this one are amazing.
[00:14:32] **Molly O'Shea:** In today's high speed business world,
[00:14:34] **Molly O'Shea:** staying ahead means using the smartest tools possible,
[00:14:37] **Molly O'Shea:** including the powerful capabilities
[00:14:39] **Molly O'Shea:** of artificial intelligence, meet Turing intelligence.

[00:15:06] **Molly O'Shea:** That's Turing.com slash sorcery.
[00:15:09] **Molly O'Shea:** So given the fact that you've invested
[00:15:11] **Molly O'Shea:** into so many companies through different waves,
[00:15:13] **Molly O'Shea:** how do you think about investing in competitive companies?
[00:15:17] **Molly O'Shea:** I'm sure there's been some crossover across.
[00:15:21] **Elad Gil:** I try to be really cautious about that
[00:15:23] **Elad Gil:** because I've started two companies myself.
[00:15:28] **Elad Gil:** And I want to be very respectful
[00:15:33] **Elad Gil:** of founders and what their goals are
[00:15:34] **Elad Gil:** and their wishes are and everything else.
[00:15:36] **Elad Gil:** And so I often ask both sides.
[00:15:38] **Elad Gil:** I say, hey, this thing has come up.
[00:15:40] **Elad Gil:** Do you view it as a conflict?
[00:15:41] **Elad Gil:** It's okay for perceived, et cetera.
[00:15:43] **Elad Gil:** And so I usually wait for that.
[00:15:46] **Elad Gil:** I think that there's a number of circumstances
[00:15:49] **Elad Gil:** where people think something's,
[00:15:50] **Elad Gil:** I'd say 90% of the time,
[00:15:52] **Elad Gil:** founders think that they're going to compete and they don't.
[00:15:54] **Elad Gil:** They tend to go in very different directions,
[00:15:55] **Elad Gil:** especially if it's to release stage companies.
[00:15:59] **Elad Gil:** And then maybe a few percent of the time,
[00:16:01] **Elad Gil:** things actually converge.
[00:16:02] **Elad Gil:** And sometimes they actually converge
[00:16:03] **Elad Gil:** in the companies that you don't expect.
[00:16:05] **Elad Gil:** And so I've seen more conflicts
[00:16:07] **Elad Gil:** than things that I didn't think would converge than things would.
[00:16:11] **Elad Gil:** And I'll give you an example.
[00:16:12] **Elad Gil:** I remember I was an investor in Square
[00:16:15] **Elad Gil:** and the striped founders pinged me
[00:16:16] **Elad Gil:** and asked if I wanted to invest.
[00:16:19] **Elad Gil:** And so I pinged one of the key executives at Square
[00:16:21] **Elad Gil:** and said, hey, do you think this is a conflict?
[00:16:24] **Elad Gil:** And he said, absolutely,
[00:16:25] **Elad Gil:** this is a conflict.
[00:16:26] **Elad Gil:** You shouldn't do it.
[00:16:27] **Elad Gil:** These things are going to collide.
[00:16:28] **Elad Gil:** And so then I texted Jack
[00:16:29] **Elad Gil:** and I'm like, hey, this is a conflict.
[00:16:30] **Elad Gil:** I was like, no, go ahead.
[00:16:31] **Elad Gil:** And so I went ahead and invested.
[00:16:33] **Elad Gil:** So I'm glad I did that extra ask.
[00:16:35] **Elad Gil:** And then in hindsight, they didn't really end up competing.
[00:16:37] **Molly O'Shea:** So is it harder on the earlier stage side?
[00:16:42] **Elad Gil:** There's definitely more potential for a complex,
[00:16:44] **Elad Gil:** but I think most of the time it's less likely.
[00:16:46] **Elad Gil:** Actually, I think on the later stage side,
[00:16:48] **Elad Gil:** is usually when it's pretty clear.
[00:16:51] **Elad Gil:** Or suddenly the industry shifts.
[00:16:52] **Elad Gil:** And then it sort of crystallizes.
[00:16:54] **Elad Gil:** And you're like, oh, wow,
[00:16:55] **Elad Gil:** like cognition is now competing with Corsair.
[00:16:57] **Elad Gil:** They bought Windsurf.
[00:16:58] **Elad Gil:** You know, it's a more direct thing
[00:17:00] **Elad Gil:** than maybe it was even six months ago.
[00:17:01] **Molly O'Shea:** Do you think because we're in this wave of AI,
[00:17:04] **Molly O'Shea:** you have to be an AI company in order to survive
[00:17:06] **Molly O'Shea:** or even be relevant?
[00:17:08] **Elad Gil:** Yeah, I mean, arguably anything software is just some extent AI now.
[00:17:11] **Elad Gil:** And so I can't think of a modern new software company
[00:17:14] **Elad Gil:** that isn't using AI.
[00:17:15] **Elad Gil:** Maybe if you're truly doing something basic
[00:17:17] **Elad Gil:** in Fintech or some other area, although that Fintech wave is
[00:17:21] **Elad Gil:** for chunks of it are kind of over, right?
[00:17:23] **Elad Gil:** There's still a lot of innovation in different areas.
[00:17:24] **Elad Gil:** And new things to do and there's a lot to do in crypto.
[00:17:27] **Elad Gil:** But fundamentally, you know, traditional Fintech
[00:17:31] **Elad Gil:** isn't as active as it used to be.
[00:17:35] **Elad Gil:** And so there may be some pockets
[00:17:36] **Elad Gil:** where if you started a company today,
[00:17:37] **Elad Gil:** when the AI wouldn't matter that much.
[00:17:39] **Elad Gil:** And you could argue it two ways.
[00:17:41] **Elad Gil:** You could say, well, if you're in the middle
[00:17:42] **Elad Gil:** of one of the most important technology waves of all times,
[00:17:44] **Elad Gil:** maybe you should be focused on that thing, right?
[00:17:48] **Elad Gil:** And in general,
[00:17:49] **Elad Gil:** early and technology waves,
[00:17:50] **Elad Gil:** that's when you have all the low-hinging fruit.
[00:17:52] **Elad Gil:** And so one of my pieces of advice to founders is often
[00:17:55] **Elad Gil:** who are doing really hard things right now.
[00:17:57] **Elad Gil:** And I'm like, why are you doing the really hard thing?
[00:17:59] **Elad Gil:** Just go do the dumb, easy thing that you think is an
[00:18:01] **Elad Gil:** undefensible and build defensibility
[00:18:03] **Elad Gil:** because of the really hard, complex thing
[00:18:05] **Elad Gil:** is something you should do in three, four years
[00:18:06] **Elad Gil:** when you've run out of the easy stuff, right?
[00:18:07] **Elad Gil:** And so it's almost like you're going for a walk
[00:18:10] **Elad Gil:** and there's a giant mountain
[00:18:11] **Elad Gil:** and there's a nice little path around it.
[00:18:12] **Elad Gil:** And you're like, I'm going to go up the mountain.
[00:18:13] **Elad Gil:** And you're like, well, you know,
[00:18:14] **Elad Gil:** there's just take the nice path.
[00:18:18] **Elad Gil:** And so I think there's that sort of overlay right now.
[00:18:20] **Elad Gil:** There's easy stuff in AI.
[00:18:21] **Elad Gil:** It's a good time to go do it.
[00:18:23] **Elad Gil:** But you know, the flip side of it
[00:18:25] **Elad Gil:** is there's lots of other areas
[00:18:26] **Elad Gil:** that people are working in,
[00:18:27] **Elad Gil:** although again, often AI plays a role.
[00:18:28] **Elad Gil:** Like defense tech is largely drones and intelligence
[00:18:31] **Elad Gil:** and other things that are, you know,
[00:18:33] **Elad Gil:** really important now in the AI world.
[00:18:36] **Elad Gil:** But there may be other verticals
[00:18:37] **Elad Gil:** versus a little bit less important.
[00:18:38] **Elad Gil:** Maybe aspects of energy, you know,
[00:18:40] **Elad Gil:** like what base energy is doing with battery stores.
[00:18:43] **Elad Gil:** That isn't necessarily AI enabled, right?
[00:18:45] **Elad Gil:** But it's a very different type of sector industry.
[00:18:47] **Molly O'Shea:** How do you think about the bottlenecks in AI
[00:18:50] **Molly O'Shea:** when being energy?
[00:18:51] **Elad Gil:** Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting question
[00:18:52] **Elad Gil:** because energy is one of those areas
[00:18:54] **Elad Gil:** where we have all sorts of solutions.
[00:18:56] **Elad Gil:** We just choose not to use them, right?
[00:18:57] **Elad Gil:** Nuclear is a great solution
[00:18:58] **Elad Gil:** for all sorts of things of energy.
[00:19:00] **Elad Gil:** And if you look at nuclear as an example,
[00:19:03] **Elad Gil:** public opinion on nuclear flipped in the mid 70s, right?
[00:19:06] **Elad Gil:** It went from something everybody was forward
[00:19:08] **Elad Gil:** to something many people were against.
[00:19:10] **Elad Gil:** And that was probably a mixture
[00:19:11] **Elad Gil:** of the environmental lobby and big oil,
[00:19:13] **Elad Gil:** effectively wanting to kill the industry.
[00:19:16] **Elad Gil:** The US is still 18% nuclear,
[00:19:18] **Elad Gil:** despite not having opened a nuclear power plant
[00:19:20] **Elad Gil:** in 50 years.
[00:19:23] **Elad Gil:** France is 70%.
[00:19:24] **Elad Gil:** Japan is 25%.
[00:19:26] **Elad Gil:** So we know that we have a clean, abundant,
[00:19:29] **Elad Gil:** very safe energy source action.
[00:19:30] **Elad Gil:** I don't know if you've ever heard
[00:19:31] **Elad Gil:** that Wikipedia page on nuclear.
[00:19:32] **Molly O'Shea:** That's how I spend most of my free time
[00:19:34] **Molly O'Shea:** in section of the page.
[00:19:35] **Elad Gil:** Yeah, I know the nuclear page specifically.
[00:19:36] **Molly O'Shea:** Specifically?
[00:19:37] **Elad Gil:** Yeah, I'm joking.
[00:19:38] **Elad Gil:** I'm joking.
[00:19:38] **Molly O'Shea:** I don't know.
[00:19:39] **Molly O'Shea:** Why?
[00:19:39] **Elad Gil:** Oh, yeah, that'd be awful.
[00:19:40] **Elad Gil:** You're pulling jokes on me.
[00:19:41] **Elad Gil:** This is unexpected.
[00:19:45] **Elad Gil:** If you read that page,
[00:19:46] **Elad Gil:** you basically see that a lot of the
[00:19:49] **Elad Gil:** direct evidence on deaths from nuclear
[00:19:53] **Elad Gil:** are very small.
[00:19:54] **Elad Gil:** And in some cases,
[00:19:55] **Elad Gil:** it's like in Fukushima,
[00:19:56] **Elad Gil:** there was two or three deaths,
[00:19:57] **Elad Gil:** and they think it was elderly people
[00:19:58] **Elad Gil:** who had heart attacks, right?
[00:20:00] **Elad Gil:** It wasn't necessarily from the radiation
[00:20:02] **Elad Gil:** or that there may have been one death there.
[00:20:04] **Elad Gil:** And so most of the deaths from nuclear
[00:20:06] **Elad Gil:** that are clearly provably traced back
[00:20:08] **Elad Gil:** to the nuclear accident
[00:20:09] **Elad Gil:** are either Russian submarines in the 80s,
[00:20:11] **Elad Gil:** which for all sorts of reasons you can imagine.
[00:20:13] **Elad Gil:** And then radiology lab accidents
[00:20:16] **Elad Gil:** where they misdose people.
[00:20:19] **Elad Gil:** And if you compare that to stats
[00:20:21] **Elad Gil:** at people dying and stalling solar
[00:20:23] **Elad Gil:** by falling off of roofs,
[00:20:24] **Elad Gil:** more people per year die from solar installs.
[00:20:28] **Elad Gil:** And so it's very safe, right?
[00:20:30] **Elad Gil:** And so we do have these things we could do
[00:20:31] **Elad Gil:** societally.
[00:20:31] **Elad Gil:** We choose not to,
[00:20:33] **Elad Gil:** which is a different topic.
[00:20:36] **Elad Gil:** But if we want to do something we can
[00:20:38] **Elad Gil:** and the question is,
[00:20:38] **Elad Gil:** are we going to constrain ourselves?
[00:20:40] **Elad Gil:** And the best example of that is probably Europe, right?
[00:20:43] **Elad Gil:** Europe's energy policy
[00:20:46] **Elad Gil:** is really hurting their ability
[00:20:48] **Elad Gil:** to win new data centers for training.
[00:20:51] **Elad Gil:** And obviously they have extra regulation for it too
[00:20:53] **Elad Gil:** that makes it worse and all these things.
[00:20:55] **Elad Gil:** But fundamentally, energy costs in Europe keep going up.
[00:20:57] **Elad Gil:** They shut down nuclear power plants in Germany
[00:20:59] **Elad Gil:** that are working perfectly fine.
[00:21:01] **Elad Gil:** They're dependent on Russian oil.
[00:21:02] **Elad Gil:** There's all sorts of very bad policy decisions.
[00:21:04] **Elad Gil:** But what that's doing is it's having this weird
[00:21:07] **Elad Gil:** side effect of hurting their AI industry
[00:21:09] **Elad Gil:** because you're not going to build new training data centers
[00:21:11] **Elad Gil:** there because it's too expensive on a relative basis to run them.
[00:21:14] **Elad Gil:** You may do inference because of GDPR forcing you to do it.
[00:21:18] **Elad Gil:** But you're not going to do training.
[00:21:19] **Elad Gil:** So all the training will probably go to places
[00:21:20] **Elad Gil:** that have the cheapest, densest energy
[00:21:24] **Elad Gil:** and then a proper fiber optic cable
[00:21:26] **Elad Gil:** in for the data transfer.
[00:21:29] **Elad Gil:** And so that's probably parts of the US.
[00:21:31] **Elad Gil:** That's probably the golf.
[00:21:32] **Elad Gil:** Like the golf five years ago,
[00:21:34] **Elad Gil:** I never would have expected.
[00:21:35] **Elad Gil:** But I think they're really going to end up
[00:21:36] **Elad Gil:** with some of these data center buildouts potentially.
[00:21:39] **Elad Gil:** The Trump administration,
[00:21:40] **Elad Gil:** I think in their AI plan actually had
[00:21:42] **Elad Gil:** the ability to sort of extend into UAE
[00:21:44] **Elad Gil:** is effectively US land from the perspective of training.
[00:21:48] **Elad Gil:** And so it's interesting to ask these questions
[00:21:50] **Elad Gil:** of like how do global energy policies impact costs
[00:21:53] **Elad Gil:** and therefore impact where AI is going to be really important
[00:21:56] **Elad Gil:** as an industry, right?
[00:21:58] **Elad Gil:** Because if you look at these data center buildouts
[00:22:01] **Elad Gil:** they've added or they've accelerated
[00:22:03] **Elad Gil:** some aspects of GDP in the US, right?
[00:22:05] **Elad Gil:** It's actually a lot of money is being spent.
[00:22:07] **Elad Gil:** And so Europe is shutting itself off
[00:22:08] **Elad Gil:** from some of that money right now.
[00:22:10] **Molly O'Shea:** How do you think about the new administration's approach
[00:22:14] **Molly O'Shea:** to technology?
[00:22:16] **Molly O'Shea:** We're going through many different waves of lots of support
[00:22:18] **Molly O'Shea:** that to your point, nuclear AI.
[00:22:21] **Molly O'Shea:** How do you view that and then the action afterwards?
[00:22:25] **Molly O'Shea:** Because things come up and they're like trendy,
[00:22:27] **Molly O'Shea:** they're cool, you get a lot of support
[00:22:29] **Molly O'Shea:** and then you're 15 minutes of fame, like dies out.
[00:22:32] **Elad Gil:** Yeah, I think it's really sector dependent.
[00:22:35] **Elad Gil:** So for example, I think in crypto,
[00:22:38] **Elad Gil:** the main thing the crypto industry wanted for years
[00:22:40] **Elad Gil:** was just certainty.
[00:22:41] **Elad Gil:** Is this something that SEC regulates the commodities folks
[00:22:45] **Elad Gil:** like who governs what, what are the rules
[00:22:47] **Elad Gil:** and how can we just follow the rules?
[00:22:48] **Elad Gil:** And so I think a lot of the crypto industry
[00:22:50] **Elad Gil:** just want to clear guidance on what to do.
[00:22:52] **Elad Gil:** And that was absent for many years.
[00:22:54] **Elad Gil:** And then I think this administration
[00:22:55] **Elad Gil:** is starting to provide a lot of that clarity.
[00:22:58] **Elad Gil:** To your point, you then need to codify it with legislation
[00:23:00] **Elad Gil:** because if you don't, it's just going to be dependent
[00:23:02] **Elad Gil:** on who's in power.
[00:23:03] **Elad Gil:** And so you want to remove that dependence.
[00:23:04] **Elad Gil:** And so I think a lot of what the crypto industry,
[00:23:06] **Elad Gil:** my sense of this thinking about is,
[00:23:08] **Elad Gil:** how do we pass certain bills or help certain bills
[00:23:11] **Elad Gil:** progress so that we can end up in a situation
[00:23:14] **Elad Gil:** where these things are codified in law
[00:23:17] **Elad Gil:** and they don't just become executive orders
[00:23:19] **Elad Gil:** that can be rescinded with the next administration.
[00:23:22] **Elad Gil:** For AI, I think similarly, we have to be very thoughtful
[00:23:25] **Elad Gil:** about it and that the dangerous part in AI was
[00:23:28] **Elad Gil:** their state level initiatives that have been very negative
[00:23:32] **Elad Gil:** or could have been very negative for AI.
[00:23:33] **Elad Gil:** I think Scott Weiner proposed one in California.
[00:23:35] **Elad Gil:** I think there's others that have been
[00:23:37] **Elad Gil:** proposed in other states that you could really
[00:23:39] **Elad Gil:** curtail overall US progress in AI
[00:23:41] **Elad Gil:** because you set the standards in one state
[00:23:43] **Elad Gil:** where it's important to function
[00:23:44] **Elad Gil:** where most of the researchers are, right?
[00:23:46] **Elad Gil:** Or where some of the data centers are, etc.
[00:23:49] **Elad Gil:** So there's a national level of it
[00:23:52] **Elad Gil:** and then there's a state level
[00:23:52] **Elad Gil:** and I think both are important for some of these topics.
[00:23:55] **Molly O'Shea:** Yeah, I think about this a lot
[00:23:57] **Molly O'Shea:** because I love the American dynamism movement
[00:23:59] **Molly O'Shea:** and how that like propelled small tech
[00:24:02] **Molly O'Shea:** as the Andreessen media empire calls it to now big tech.
[00:24:07] **Molly O'Shea:** So as we think about the government's involvement
[00:24:11] **Molly O'Shea:** in these different sectors,
[00:24:12] **Molly O'Shea:** they're also putting dollars to work.
[00:24:15] **Molly O'Shea:** So how are these deals one getting structured
[00:24:17] **Molly O'Shea:** whether it's MP materials or Intel
[00:24:20] **Molly O'Shea:** and are you at all concerned about them
[00:24:22] **Molly O'Shea:** and whatever happens with TikTok?
[00:24:24] **Elad Gil:** Yeah, I don't have deep thoughts on those things.
[00:24:25] **Elad Gil:** I haven't spent a lot of time looking at
[00:24:27] **Elad Gil:** government investment in some of these companies
[00:24:30] **Elad Gil:** and they very much are companies
[00:24:31] **Elad Gil:** that I tend not to spend as much time with
[00:24:33] **Elad Gil:** because they're much later on in life.
[00:24:34] **Elad Gil:** I mean, Intel was started in the 70s
[00:24:36] **Elad Gil:** and it was late 60s, I can't remember at this point.
[00:24:40] **Elad Gil:** And so I just haven't thought about this very deeply.
[00:24:46] **Elad Gil:** I think there's a slightly different question
[00:24:48] **Elad Gil:** and I think Andreessen Horowitz for example
[00:24:49] **Elad Gil:** has been very good at promoting this concept of small tech
[00:24:51] **Elad Gil:** and we need to advocate for that.
[00:24:54] **Elad Gil:** I do think that one thing the prior administration has done
[00:24:57] **Elad Gil:** which this administration is to some extent continuing
[00:24:59] **Elad Gil:** is effectively curtailing some of the M&A activity
[00:25:02] **Elad Gil:** and normally see big tech participating in.
[00:25:05] **Elad Gil:** And I actually think that's a negative
[00:25:06] **Elad Gil:** for the startup ecosystem.
[00:25:07] **Elad Gil:** I think it's good for companies to be able to exit.
[00:25:09] **Elad Gil:** I think we're going through a massive sea change
[00:25:11] **Elad Gil:** right now technologically.
[00:25:12] **Elad Gil:** A lot of things are being innovative
[00:25:14] **Elad Gil:** on that won't necessarily sustain on their own
[00:25:17] **Elad Gil:** and actually having larger partners will help a lot for them.
[00:25:21] **Elad Gil:** I was looking a little bit at the data from the 90s
[00:25:23] **Elad Gil:** because I thought I was really interesting to say,
[00:25:24] **Elad Gil:** okay, we're in this weird moment in time in AI.
[00:25:27] **Elad Gil:** What did the internet version look like?
[00:25:28] **Molly O'Shea:** Sorcery is proudly sponsored by Carta.

[00:26:13] **Molly O'Shea:** Do you know how many companies went public at 99?
[00:26:16] **Elad Gil:** 200.
[00:26:17] **Molly O'Shea:** It was close, 450.
[00:26:18] **Elad Gil:** And then in the first, well, you know, it was within an order of magnitude.
[00:26:21] **Elad Gil:** In the hundreds, it was close, in my opinion.
[00:26:23] **Elad Gil:** You didn't say like 10 or, you know, 10,000.
[00:26:26] **Molly O'Shea:** And then if you look at the first part of 2000,
[00:26:29] **Molly O'Shea:** another 450 or so companies went public.
[00:26:32] **Molly O'Shea:** And then before that, I'm guessing another 1,000
[00:26:34] **Molly O'Shea:** internet companies went public.
[00:26:35] **Molly O'Shea:** So you had 2,000 companies go public.
[00:26:39] **Molly O'Shea:** How many of those are relevant now, or even exist, right?
[00:26:42] **Elad Gil:** There's probably two or three companies that are highly relevant,
[00:26:44] **Elad Gil:** very important, Amazon, and the like.
[00:26:47] **Elad Gil:** And then there's probably a dozen companies that are still around
[00:26:49] **Elad Gil:** that are important enough or important-ish.
[00:26:53] **Elad Gil:** And then the other 1,980 companies all died or got bought, right?
[00:27:01] **Elad Gil:** And so we had this massive culling of the entire ecosystem.
[00:27:04] **Elad Gil:** However, it will be short period of time.
[00:27:06] **Elad Gil:** And so the question is, what's the AI version of that?
[00:27:09] **Elad Gil:** And how should you think about that as a founder?
[00:27:11] **Elad Gil:** And how should you think about that as an investor?
[00:27:13] **Elad Gil:** And there's all sorts of aspects of that.
[00:27:15] **Elad Gil:** Should you sell your company or not?
[00:27:16] **Elad Gil:** What are the signs you should?
[00:27:17] **Elad Gil:** When should you exit?
[00:27:20] **Elad Gil:** How do you think about that?
[00:27:21] **Elad Gil:** Relative to what you're trying to accomplish both from an impact perspective
[00:27:25] **Elad Gil:** and then also from a business perspective?
[00:27:27] **Elad Gil:** And I don't think that many people are really actively thinking about that,
[00:27:30] **Elad Gil:** but it is an interesting cautionary tale.
[00:27:33] **Molly O'Shea:** What do you think is going to happen to all those companies that we're supposed to go public
[00:27:35] **Molly O'Shea:** that are just waiting?
[00:27:37] **Elad Gil:** Oh, so the backlog from 10 years ago.
[00:27:38] **Molly O'Shea:** Yeah, the backlog.
[00:27:40] **Elad Gil:** Yeah, I mean, I think a subset of them will go out.
[00:27:42] **Elad Gil:** I think one interesting ship that's happened is there may be a subset of companies that are
[00:27:46] **Elad Gil:** forever private because it can afford to be.
[00:27:48] **Elad Gil:** That may be Stripe.
[00:27:49] **Elad Gil:** That may be SpaceX.
[00:27:50] **Elad Gil:** That may be some other companies.
[00:27:52] **Elad Gil:** And I think it's only, I don't know if you remember the direct listing wave of like 2020 or
[00:27:57] **Elad Gil:** whenever all these companies started doing DLs.
[00:27:59] **Elad Gil:** And it was considered the next big thing and then like five companies did it, right?
[00:28:03] **Elad Gil:** I think it's quite possible that this forever private thing will be similar.
[00:28:06] **Elad Gil:** And there's a handful of companies that are marquee brands.
[00:28:08] **Elad Gil:** They'll always have access to capital.
[00:28:11] **Elad Gil:** And the founders have a specific way that they want to do things.
[00:28:14] **Elad Gil:** And they'll just be private.
[00:28:16] **Elad Gil:** And then I think there's a bunch of companies that will just do the normal IPO thing and
[00:28:21] **Elad Gil:** all the rest of it.
[00:28:21] **Elad Gil:** And it's kind of interesting to ask like what percentage of future market cap
[00:28:25] **Elad Gil:** will be these perpetually private companies versus not?
[00:28:27] **Elad Gil:** And will they eventually go public?
[00:28:29] **Elad Gil:** There's also a dynamics of then kicking around capital markets and other aspects of these things.
[00:28:33] **Molly O'Shea:** How do you view that as an investor in getting returns?
[00:28:37] **Elad Gil:** Like I've never sold a share of Stripe and I hope to never do so.
[00:28:42] **Elad Gil:** Or I shouldn't say never.
[00:28:43] **Elad Gil:** Like for a very long time, I believe in the company.
[00:28:46] **Elad Gil:** But it does impact how you think about,
[00:28:50] **Elad Gil:** do they have regular tenders?
[00:28:52] **Elad Gil:** Can you get liquidity?
[00:28:53] **Elad Gil:** And for most companies that are doing well,
[00:28:56] **Elad Gil:** you can always find some form of liquidity.
[00:28:57] **Elad Gil:** The question is do you want to take it?
[00:28:59] **Elad Gil:** What's the discount?
[00:29:00] **Elad Gil:** And also is there pressure?
[00:29:02] **Elad Gil:** And what's where to pressure?
[00:29:03] **Elad Gil:** And can you avoid that pressure over time?
[00:29:04] **Elad Gil:** And so how do you even structure?
[00:29:06] **Elad Gil:** How do you approach investments if you're an investor?
[00:29:08] **Elad Gil:** If you're a founder or similar to other maybe things that you do or don't want to do,
[00:29:11] **Elad Gil:** relative to the structure or so?
[00:29:12] **Molly O'Shea:** Do you coach any of your founders on the different exit paths?
[00:29:15] **Elad Gil:** Yeah, people call me quite a bit on that stuff.
[00:29:18] **Elad Gil:** And I think it's always this context dependent.
[00:29:20] **Elad Gil:** I think the only good generic startup advice is that there's no good generic startup advice.
[00:29:24] **Elad Gil:** So I think it's all contextual.
[00:29:26] **Molly O'Shea:** The HubSpot CEO tweeted out,
[00:29:28] **Molly O'Shea:** if you want to sell your company, sell it now.
[00:29:30] **Molly O'Shea:** What do you think about that?
[00:29:32] **Elad Gil:** I think that's always true.
[00:29:35] **Elad Gil:** Like if you want to sell your company, you know,
[00:29:37] **Elad Gil:** you probably should sell your company.
[00:29:39] **Elad Gil:** I think there's usually four reasons people sell.
[00:29:42] **Elad Gil:** Right?
[00:29:43] **Elad Gil:** They're really tired.
[00:29:44] **Elad Gil:** You're burnt out.
[00:29:45] **Elad Gil:** You've been working nonstop.
[00:29:46] **Elad Gil:** You're not getting any joy out of it.
[00:29:47] **Elad Gil:** You're fighting with your co-founder, whatever it is.
[00:29:50] **Elad Gil:** So one is just unhappy or you're tired.
[00:29:54] **Elad Gil:** Two is a company's paying so far ahead
[00:29:57] **Elad Gil:** that it makes sense for you to do the math and you're like,
[00:29:59] **Elad Gil:** there's no way I'm going to hit that in any reasonable time frame.
[00:30:02] **Elad Gil:** And some people keep going then,
[00:30:03] **Elad Gil:** but rationally, it's kind of like maybe I really should get out.
[00:30:06] **Elad Gil:** And the hard part is to know,
[00:30:08] **Elad Gil:** is that correct or not?
[00:30:10] **Elad Gil:** And I think that maybe the way I would put it is,
[00:30:12] **Elad Gil:** there's a handful of companies that should never sell
[00:30:15] **Elad Gil:** or should never have sold.
[00:30:16] **Elad Gil:** But in some cases, they did.
[00:30:17] **Elad Gil:** And maybe they did the math wrong
[00:30:19] **Elad Gil:** or maybe they misunderstood their own position
[00:30:20] **Elad Gil:** or something else.
[00:30:21] **Elad Gil:** Right?
[00:30:23] **Elad Gil:** But if you're in one of those companies,
[00:30:24] **Elad Gil:** you should never sell.
[00:30:25] **Elad Gil:** You should keep going.
[00:30:28] **Elad Gil:** And then most other companies probably should sell.
[00:30:31] **Elad Gil:** And this should just figure out the right price
[00:30:33] **Elad Gil:** because most companies just don't get that big.
[00:30:34] **Elad Gil:** And most companies fail.
[00:30:35] **Elad Gil:** I think one thing we forgot in this era of sort of
[00:30:38] **Elad Gil:** perpetual funding is that the traditional venture portfolio,
[00:30:41] **Elad Gil:** you know, 50 to 80% of companies would fail outright.
[00:30:46] **Elad Gil:** And even at the series B stage,
[00:30:47] **Elad Gil:** it was like 40, 50% of every company fails.
[00:30:50] **Elad Gil:** It's a lot of companies go out of business.
[00:30:52] **Elad Gil:** And I remember there was one company.
[00:30:55] **Elad Gil:** I think it was Friendster.
[00:30:56] **Elad Gil:** They got offered what was it?
[00:30:58] **Elad Gil:** Like a percent or two of Google at the time.
[00:31:01] **Elad Gil:** As they were raising their series A.
[00:31:04] **Elad Gil:** And it's possible they could have turned into Facebook.
[00:31:06] **Elad Gil:** And that was a right decision.
[00:31:07] **Elad Gil:** But you know, you see these companies
[00:31:08] **Elad Gil:** where they really could have been these massive outsides.
[00:31:11] **Elad Gil:** Outcomes if they'd sold that then, you know,
[00:31:13] **Elad Gil:** in the end, it didn't necessarily work out as well.
[00:31:17] **Elad Gil:** And then there's a third reason which is competitive dynamics.
[00:31:19] **Elad Gil:** Like, you know, there's again a handful of reasons to actually sell.
[00:31:22] **Molly O'Shea:** This is an interesting step because
[00:31:26] **Molly O'Shea:** the series A, there's like such a wide gap there
[00:31:29] **Molly O'Shea:** and a wide gap in valuation.
[00:31:30] **Molly O'Shea:** Those companies that are actually AI companies
[00:31:33] **Molly O'Shea:** are getting a 30% premium.
[00:31:35] **Molly O'Shea:** Do you think that's like, do you think that's a mark of a hype cycle?
[00:31:39] **Molly O'Shea:** Do you think that's relative?
[00:31:41] **Elad Gil:** I think every time you go through a big technology shift,
[00:31:43] **Elad Gil:** things are simultaneously over an underhyped.
[00:31:46] **Elad Gil:** And they're
[00:31:49] **Elad Gil:** underhyped because it's such a massive wave of transformation.
[00:31:52] **Elad Gil:** So say you look at Azure earnings a quarter or two ago,
[00:31:56] **Elad Gil:** they did, I think it was like 28 billion in revenue-ish
[00:31:59] **Elad Gil:** and 10 to 15% of that was AI.
[00:32:02] **Elad Gil:** So it's a few billion dollars a quarter
[00:32:05] **Elad Gil:** on Azure alone for AI spend.
[00:32:07] **Elad Gil:** That's enormous, right?
[00:32:08] **Elad Gil:** If you extrapolate to the other clouds and everything else,
[00:32:09] **Elad Gil:** that's real money.
[00:32:11] **Elad Gil:** So real money is being spent on AI today
[00:32:13] **Elad Gil:** and there's very little actual impact
[00:32:15] **Elad Gil:** which to me means there's even more room to go.
[00:32:17] **Elad Gil:** In other words, we're just in the very earliest innings
[00:32:19] **Elad Gil:** of all this stuff, from adoption and usage and everything else.
[00:32:22] **Elad Gil:** And there's massive adoption.
[00:32:23] **Elad Gil:** You look at chat GPT, you look at cursor,
[00:32:25] **Elad Gil:** you look at cognition, you look at all these things.
[00:32:27] **Elad Gil:** So we already know that it's important that it works
[00:32:30] **Elad Gil:** and it can really scale up.
[00:32:33] **Elad Gil:** And so it's underhyped from that perspective.
[00:32:35] **Elad Gil:** And then the average company is probably overhyped
[00:32:37] **Elad Gil:** back to this point of 2000 IPOs
[00:32:39] **Elad Gil:** and like a dozen relevant companies, right?
[00:32:41] **Elad Gil:** Definitely most startups are going to fail.
[00:32:44] **Elad Gil:** And this wave is going to be just like every other one
[00:32:48] **Elad Gil:** and the place where every founder and investor
[00:32:50] **Elad Gil:** think they are is in the right companies, right?
[00:32:53] **Elad Gil:** And the reality is most people aren't, right?
[00:32:56] **Elad Gil:** 90% of people are going to be in something that doesn't work.
[00:32:59] **Elad Gil:** And so then the question is,
[00:33:00] **Elad Gil:** can you actually tell what is good and what isn't
[00:33:03] **Elad Gil:** and what's durable versus not?
[00:33:04] **Elad Gil:** And there's different forms of durability.
[00:33:06] **Elad Gil:** The short-term durability and long-term durability.
[00:33:07] **Elad Gil:** The short-term durability was brain-tree, right?
[00:33:11] **Elad Gil:** Brain-tree was a great payments company.
[00:33:14] **Elad Gil:** When I funded Stripe, everybody thought,
[00:33:16] **Elad Gil:** why would you fund Stripe?
[00:33:17] **Elad Gil:** Brain-tree already does it.
[00:33:18] **Elad Gil:** Literally, that's what people would say.
[00:33:20] **Elad Gil:** And then Brain-tree eventually got bought by PayPal for,
[00:33:22] **Elad Gil:** I think it was 800 million.
[00:33:23] **Elad Gil:** And Stripe is now a $100 billion market cup company.
[00:33:27] **Elad Gil:** And so it would have been great to be involved with brain-tree
[00:33:30] **Elad Gil:** but it wouldn't even better to be involved with Stripe.
[00:33:32] **Elad Gil:** And so when I look at the set of AI companies today,
[00:33:34] **Elad Gil:** part of the question I ask is, is this brain-tree
[00:33:36] **Elad Gil:** or is this Stripe even if it's working?
[00:33:38] **Elad Gil:** Right? Because just the fact that it's working now
[00:33:40] **Elad Gil:** doesn't mean that five years from now,
[00:33:41] **Elad Gil:** it's going to be the important company in the market
[00:33:43] **Elad Gil:** given how fast things are changing and the competitive dynamics
[00:33:45] **Elad Gil:** and all the rest of it.
[00:33:46] **Molly O'Shea:** Can you justify opening a $500 billion secondary valuation?
[00:33:51] **Elad Gil:** I don't know all the details of their revenue and things like that.
[00:33:54] **Elad Gil:** My sense is that for many of these foundational companies,
[00:33:58] **Elad Gil:** if you just do a revenue multiple and you look at the growth rate,
[00:34:01] **Elad Gil:** it's actually pretty reasonable.
[00:34:03] **Elad Gil:** That's true of OpenAI, that's true of Anthropic.
[00:34:05] **Elad Gil:** I think it's actually surprising.
[00:34:06] **Elad Gil:** You look at it and you're like, oh my gosh,
[00:34:08] **Elad Gil:** I have a lot of revenue and it's growing really fast.
[00:34:11] **Elad Gil:** And obviously you look at margin structure and other things,
[00:34:13] **Elad Gil:** but it actually seems like it's in the ballpark
[00:34:15] **Elad Gil:** of a reasonable for many of these things.
[00:34:17] **Elad Gil:** I don't know again, specifically OpenAI's latest numbers,
[00:34:21] **Elad Gil:** so I can't say specifically about them.
[00:34:22] **Elad Gil:** But in general, as I've looked at these things over time,
[00:34:24] **Elad Gil:** it's actually been pretty reasonable.
[00:34:26] **Molly O'Shea:** What do you think it takes to become a trillion-dollar company?
[00:34:29] **Elad Gil:** Cam, just a big market.
[00:34:31] **Elad Gil:** That's really the answer.
[00:34:32] **Elad Gil:** Google's a giant market, AI chat or API's a giant market.
[00:34:37] **Elad Gil:** Cloud businesses are giant markets.
[00:34:40] **Elad Gil:** Selling productivity software plus the world's most important OS
[00:34:44] **Elad Gil:** or one of the most important OS is a giant market.
[00:34:47] **Elad Gil:** Selling phones to a billion people.
[00:34:49] **Elad Gil:** And one of the world's most important OS is a giant business.
[00:34:51] **Elad Gil:** These are giant businesses.
[00:34:53] **Elad Gil:** Selling chips for everything for AI is a giant business.
[00:34:56] **Molly O'Shea:** What do you think on the founder level?
[00:34:58] **Molly O'Shea:** What do you think it takes for a founder to get to that level?
[00:35:02] **Elad Gil:** Yeah, I think ultimately there's usually two or three characteristics.
[00:35:09] **Elad Gil:** One is you have to find a giant tam and build a product people care about in it.
[00:35:13] **Elad Gil:** And the question is, is that luck or is that skill?
[00:35:17] **Elad Gil:** And I think for some people, I used to do this thing.
[00:35:21] **Elad Gil:** I don't really do it anymore.
[00:35:22] **Elad Gil:** When I meet people, I sometimes almost think of their life
[00:35:24] **Elad Gil:** as like a Monte Carlo simulation.
[00:35:26] **Elad Gil:** If I revend their life, which everybody does, right?
[00:35:27] **Elad Gil:** It's like a standard thing people do.
[00:35:30] **Elad Gil:** If you revend their life a billion times, what's the expected outcome?
[00:35:33] **Elad Gil:** Or what's the average expected outcome?
[00:35:34] **Elad Gil:** And for some people, you meet them and they're like, oh my gosh,
[00:35:36] **Elad Gil:** this person is amazing.
[00:35:38] **Elad Gil:** Their average outcome is going to be up here.
[00:35:40] **Elad Gil:** And for other people, they're like, wow, this person got lucky.
[00:35:42] **Elad Gil:** You know, they're not that good.
[00:35:44] **Elad Gil:** And they hit that thing.
[00:35:45] **Elad Gil:** And oh my gosh, what a lucky, you know, I'm not going to cost,
[00:35:48] **Elad Gil:** but what a lucky person.
[00:35:52] **Elad Gil:** And so usually the people running these companies are really good.
[00:35:56] **Elad Gil:** And you know, it's really good finding the timer.
[00:35:59] **Elad Gil:** It's really good exploiting it.
[00:36:00] **Elad Gil:** And maybe it's both.
[00:36:01] **Elad Gil:** I'm not sure.
[00:36:03] **Elad Gil:** But the best founders tend to be very smart, very driven,
[00:36:09] **Elad Gil:** very aggressive, want to win relentless work ethic.
[00:36:13] **Elad Gil:** You know, it's a bunch of stuff that for a couple of years,
[00:36:15] **Elad Gil:** people tried to say was important, but it's extremely important.
[00:36:18] **Elad Gil:** They tend to be very smart, very strategic,
[00:36:23] **Elad Gil:** able to motivate people extremely well.
[00:36:26] **Elad Gil:** I don't think, and you know, people are kind of on this weird,
[00:36:28] **Elad Gil:** mimetic thing about autism.
[00:36:30] **Elad Gil:** They're not autistic.
[00:36:31] **Elad Gil:** You know, they read people very well,
[00:36:33] **Elad Gil:** whether they care about how the person's feeling in the moment
[00:36:37] **Elad Gil:** may matter less or more, but they can read people very well.
[00:36:39] **Elad Gil:** And they know how to motivate them and poke them.
[00:36:41] **Elad Gil:** And you know, so I think a lot of that stuff
[00:36:43] **Elad Gil:** gets really misunderstood.
[00:36:44] **Elad Gil:** Some of them are deeply loyal and friendly people, you know.
[00:36:47] **Elad Gil:** So I think there's these interesting, almost misconceptions
[00:36:51] **Elad Gil:** and start-up lore about like what makes for somebody
[00:36:53] **Elad Gil:** who's very effective at these highest levels.
[00:36:55] **Molly O'Shea:** Who's an entrepreneur that you admire?
[00:36:58] **Elad Gil:** I mean, Elon Musk has just accomplished amazing things.
[00:37:01] **Molly O'Shea:** Why?
[00:37:02] **Elad Gil:** Why is he accomplished them or why are they amazing?
[00:37:06] **Molly O'Shea:** Well, I mean sending rockets into space,
[00:37:07] **Molly O'Shea:** building a next-gen electrification companies,
[00:37:12] **Molly O'Shea:** slash cars for the first time in the US in a long time.
[00:37:17] **Molly O'Shea:** You know, co-founding OpenAI, like that's pretty good.
[00:37:22] **Elad Gil:** It's not bad.
[00:37:22] **Molly O'Shea:** Yeah, it's not bad, you know.
[00:37:23] **Elad Gil:** He's doing okay.
[00:37:24] **Elad Gil:** He's done fine, you know.
[00:37:25] **Molly O'Shea:** I could have done better by saying, you know, it's not bad.
[00:37:28] **Molly O'Shea:** So.
