[00:00:00] I was looking a little bit at the data from the 90s because I thought we're in this weird moment in time in AI.
[00:00:04] What did the internet version look like?
[00:00:06] It spans the globe like a super high one.
[00:00:08] It is called Internet.
[00:00:10] That is a whole group of networks.
[00:00:12] Do you know how many companies in public in 99?
[00:00:14] 200.
[00:00:15] It was close, 450.
[00:00:16] And then if you look at the first part of 2000,
[00:00:19] another 450 or so companies in public.
[00:00:21] And then before that, I'm guessing another 1000 internet companies in public.
[00:00:24] How many of those are relevant now?
[00:00:26] Or even exist?
[00:00:27] I think one interesting ship that's happened is there may be a subset of companies that are forever private
[00:00:31] because it can afford to be.
[00:00:33] That may be Stripe, that may be SpaceX, that may be some other companies.
[00:00:36] I don't know if you remember the direct listing wave of like 2020 or whenever all these companies start doing DLs
[00:00:41] and it was considered the next big thing and then like five companies did it.
[00:00:44] Right?
[00:00:45] I think it's quite possible that this forever private thing will be similar.
[00:00:48] And then I think there's a bunch of companies that will just do the normal IPO thing and all the rest of it.
[00:00:52] And it's interesting to ask like what percentage of future market cap
[00:00:55] will be these perpetually private companies versus not.
[00:00:57] And will they eventually go public?
[00:00:59] The HubSpot CEO tweeted out if you want to sell your company selling now.
[00:01:02] I think that's always true.
[00:01:15] Elad, Elad.
[00:01:17] Molly, Molly.
[00:01:18] Welcome to Sorcery.
[00:01:19] Thanks for having me.
[00:01:20] Okay, so I have like two sets of questions.
[00:01:23] One is the fun route and one is the serious route.
[00:01:26] Oh, which one do you choose?
[00:01:28] I don't know.
[00:01:29] Maybe the fun route.
[00:01:31] We're going to the serious route.
[00:01:32] It's up to you.
[00:01:33] I mean, it's your it's your podcast.
[00:01:35] It's your choice.
[00:01:35] It's your choice.
[00:01:37] It feels like a very loaded choice.
[00:01:39] Like if you choose a fun route but then you're not actually that fun.
[00:01:42] You're having a much fun.
[00:01:42] People will be like, oh, that person isn't fun.
[00:01:45] So the serious route is actually the safer route.
[00:01:46] But it sounds as fun.
[00:01:48] What if I told you I only prepared one?
[00:01:50] Let's do the serious route.
[00:01:52] That sounds amazing.
[00:01:53] Let's go.
[00:01:54] Okay, so doing some deep research on you.
[00:01:57] You have had a very interesting, unexpected career.
[00:02:03] Google, Twitter, color genomics.
[00:02:07] You then wrote a book.
[00:02:10] Then you were one of the first AI investors.
[00:02:13] And you have a podcast now.
[00:02:16] You're doing incubations.
[00:02:17] You also have a very successful fund.
[00:02:21] So how did you do all this?
[00:02:25] Yeah, I mean, I guess I've just been around for a while.
[00:02:27] So these things accumulate with time.
[00:02:32] I don't know if there's much more than that.
[00:02:33] I think the honest answer is,
[00:02:37] I have sort of a broader set of things that guide me in terms of
[00:02:41] I view technology as a force for good.
[00:02:43] I think it has helped raise,
[00:02:45] elevate hundreds of millions of people.
[00:02:46] Out of poverty, out of famine, out of all sorts of things.
[00:02:48] I mean, technology in a broad way.
[00:02:50] Right, technology is the agricultural revolution.
[00:02:53] It's new medicines.
[00:02:55] It's biotech.
[00:02:55] It's running water.
[00:02:58] It's all sorts of things.
[00:02:59] And so when I look at the impact that's had on humanity,
[00:03:02] it's been very positive.
[00:03:02] And obviously, there's always the negative things that can happen.
[00:03:04] All the rest of my thing has been very net positive.
[00:03:07] And so throughout my career, I've kind of asked myself,
[00:03:10] where do I think technology can be most valuable,
[00:03:12] most useful?
[00:03:12] How can I help transfer it in the world?
[00:03:14] And so that's driven a lot of the choices
[00:03:16] that were to be and what to work on.
[00:03:17] And how to get involved with things.
[00:03:20] Not to mention monuments.
[00:03:22] And monuments.
[00:03:23] And so, yeah, I'm working on a project now to try and build
[00:03:26] a series of new monuments.
[00:03:27] So if you look at every society that's at Apex,
[00:03:31] ultimately,
[00:03:33] has built large public art to inspire the next generation
[00:03:36] to move forward for progress.
[00:03:38] Maybe it captures its ethical values.
[00:03:40] Maybe it captures its ambition.
[00:03:42] And I think the last time we built a large scale monument
[00:03:44] was Mount Rushmore, which was initiated in the 20s
[00:03:48] and was built up until the early 40s.
[00:03:50] And then since that time, we really haven't done anything,
[00:03:52] societally, at least in the US.
[00:03:53] Maybe you could argue the sphere in Las Vegas
[00:03:55] is almost like a monument of some sort, right?
[00:03:59] But we used to do these really big symbols.
[00:04:01] And the Statue of Liberty, which was obviously a gift
[00:04:04] as a great example of that.
[00:04:05] You'd get off of Ellis Island as an immigrant,
[00:04:06] and you'd be inspired by this giant statue
[00:04:11] and this symbolic nature of like Liberty and Freedom
[00:04:13] and this new land that you've come to.
[00:04:16] And so we're working on doing monuments
[00:04:20] or public art across four or five key cities in the US.
[00:04:25] And we've been talking with different both artists
[00:04:28] and artisans around different materials
[00:04:29] so we've experimented with different bronze works.
[00:04:32] We've experimented with marble.
[00:04:33] We're actually looking at carbon fiber,
[00:04:34] which nobody's really used,
[00:04:35] which you think is really interesting for all sorts of reasons.
[00:04:37] And then we've provided proposals to a few places already
[00:04:42] in terms of some of the public art that we could build.
[00:04:44] And I think the smaller scale of what we want to do
[00:04:46] is probably 15 to 20 feet tall,
[00:04:48] which is kind of the scale of the Atlas
[00:04:49] in front of Rockefeller Center,
[00:04:52] which I think is a beautiful work.
[00:04:54] And then the hope is to eventually do something,
[00:04:56] at least one that's sort of Statue of Liberty
[00:04:58] or Eiffel Tower scale.

[00:06:01] How do you make something not so polarizing in today's world?
[00:06:07] I don't know.
[00:06:08] I mean, in yester years' world,
[00:06:11] these things were polarizing.
[00:06:12] So the Eiffel Tower was considered very ugly when it was built.
[00:06:15] It was a giant steel work.
[00:06:17] And Eiffel was actually a bridge maker.
[00:06:20] And he had all these divots and pieces of steel.
[00:06:22] He's like, I'm going to make a big thing for the world fair
[00:06:25] in the late 1800s.
[00:06:27] And it was actually a mentorship for steelmaking.
[00:06:30] It was an ode to technology progress.
[00:06:32] And apparently a big chunk of the city thought it was ugly and terrible.
[00:06:36] And they were looking for it.
[00:06:37] They're getting torn down.
[00:06:39] And so I think these things that we now view as beautiful and iconic
[00:06:43] and inspiring and wonderful at the time were not viewed that way.
[00:06:46] And one thing that I thought was really cool.
[00:06:47] I went to see the Eiffel Tower actually recently.
[00:06:49] It's sort of a refresher over the summer.
[00:06:51] And he had his office on one of the top floors.
[00:06:54] And it was a power move for him to invite people to his office.
[00:06:57] And they would take the pneumatic lift.
[00:06:58] I don't know if you've been in it.
[00:06:59] It's a very quiet elevator that was built 150 years ago
[00:07:03] using modern technology right of the day.
[00:07:06] And so the elevator takes you up there and you get in and you go into his little office.
[00:07:09] And they still have the desk and everything set up.
[00:07:11] And it was him showing off.
[00:07:13] Like what he built, which I thought was kind of neat.
[00:07:15] I'm curious what happens.
[00:07:19] Because it's a versus go.
[00:07:20] Do you remember that statue?
[00:07:22] Is that still up?
[00:07:23] Which one?
[00:07:23] The woman one in front of the Embarcadera?
[00:07:26] No, I'm not sure if it's still up.
[00:07:27] They also used to do a lot of Burning Man art in his valley.
[00:07:30] And if you remember, they'd bring art from Burning Man
[00:07:32] or right before they take it to the burn.
[00:07:33] And they put that up there.
[00:07:35] But there's a lot of temporary art still.
[00:07:38] And so there's some in San Francisco.
[00:07:39] There's some in New York periodically.
[00:07:41] They'll sort of do some public works.
[00:07:44] There's a little bit of Miami sometimes.
[00:07:46] But I'd really like to move to big permanent installations
[00:07:49] that have meaning that hopefully can transcend a really long time period.
[00:07:53] Hundreds of years, you know, you want the thing to be relevant.
[00:07:56] 200 years from now.
[00:07:57] And so then you ask the question of, okay,
[00:07:58] what are society relevant themes over long periods of time?
[00:08:02] And what is actually forms of beauty
[00:08:04] that we will agree 200 years from now is still beautiful?
[00:08:07] Because if you look at a lot of postmodernism
[00:08:09] and a lot of architecture,
[00:08:10] I don't think it's that attractive anymore.
[00:08:12] Right?
[00:08:12] And there are things that are still beautiful, right?
[00:08:14] Gothic periods and art.go.
[00:08:17] And you know, there's all sorts of people still
[00:08:19] love seeing Roman ruins because they're so beautiful.
[00:08:22] Right?
[00:08:22] Even though they're ruins.
[00:08:24] So I think there's some things that feel like they're universal
[00:08:26] and there's some things that seem like they're a moment of time
[00:08:28] from an art or architecture perspective.
[00:08:30] What do you think of?
[00:08:31] Is it Bezos that has the clock's sculpture?
[00:08:34] Yeah.
[00:08:34] Oh, yeah, he has the, basically,
[00:08:36] he tried to build a clock that would last for millennia.
[00:08:40] And I think it's very cool conceptually.
[00:08:42] I think it's really neat that he did that and he was thinking big.
[00:08:45] I think the hard part is it's kind of isolated.
[00:08:47] You kind of have to go out to get to it.
[00:08:49] And so what I'm interested in is,
[00:08:51] can you do these societally inspiring things?
[00:08:53] But in major cities and major thoroughfares,
[00:08:56] like how can you be central to where people are spending time?
[00:08:59] Because if people don't see it, it kind of doesn't matter, you know?
[00:09:02] As a multi-dimensional person,
[00:09:05] you have culture, you have investing, you have technology and science.
[00:09:09] On the investing standpoint,
[00:09:10] you started off with angel investing.
[00:09:13] Sure.
[00:09:13] Currently, you're going to have a big fun soon.
[00:09:15] Yeah.
[00:09:16] How did we get here?
[00:09:17] Like, so what was the arc from angel investing to this fund?
[00:09:20] Because the strategy is insane.
[00:09:24] Like, you're doing seed and precede and incubations,
[00:09:28] but you're also leading $100 million series fees.
[00:09:33] Yeah.
[00:09:33] I think, um, basically, we've yourselves
[00:09:35] investing from incubation or precede through pre-IPO.
[00:09:38] And at this point,
[00:09:40] have done every stage and have done very large investments.
[00:09:43] So I think we've now led a few rounds
[00:09:46] that are a half billion plus each.
[00:09:48] And, um, you know, ultimately,
[00:09:51] the starting point to your original question was,
[00:09:53] I was just investing my own money as an angel
[00:09:57] and I ran out of money.
[00:09:58] Like, literally, I just, I ran out of money
[00:09:59] because I put all my money to startups.
[00:10:02] And so I started raising SPVs,
[00:10:04] which are these single investment funds, right?
[00:10:07] You raised money to invest in a specific company.
[00:10:10] And that was really tough for a couple of years.
[00:10:11] Like, nobody had heard of me.
[00:10:13] It was very unusual for a single person to go and raise funds.
[00:10:16] Um, and I was, I was involved with a lot of the key companies
[00:10:20] who kept giving me bigger and bigger allocations,
[00:10:22] like a stripe or other companies.
[00:10:23] And I just couldn't, I just didn't have the money.
[00:10:26] And so I skipped together the first few of those.
[00:10:29] And then the LPs and those eventually asked me to,
[00:10:32] if I wanted to do a standalone sort of fund.
[00:10:35] And I kept angel investing alongside that.
[00:10:37] And now I kind of do a mix of,
[00:10:39] if I can still do personal investments,
[00:10:40] I can do things through the funds,
[00:10:41] I can do incubations, you know, it's, it's kind of
[00:10:44] multifaceted.
[00:10:44] And to your point, we even do things now,
[00:10:46] like AI driven rollups, right?
[00:10:47] So we'll help actually fund entrepreneur founder
[00:10:51] who wants to go and consolidate an industry
[00:10:52] or buy into different traditional businesses
[00:10:54] and then, you know, modernize them with AI.
[00:10:56] How do you think about the categories?
[00:10:59] Because you're investing in many different things.
[00:11:01] As a solo GP, by the way.
[00:11:03] Yeah, well, I'm going to have a small team,
[00:11:04] but how big is the team?
[00:11:05] Uh, on the investment side,
[00:11:07] I have four people who are helping me.
[00:11:09] And then I have about another six, seven people helping
[00:11:13] with back office and finance.
[00:11:14] And, you know, I tend to have always thought
[00:11:17] that it's really important to ensure
[00:11:18] that you're properly focused on compliance and accounting.
[00:11:21] And, you know, I'm very paranoid about doing things properly.
[00:11:25] And I'm always paranoid about fraud
[00:11:27] or other things that can really be existential to a business.
[00:11:29] And so I view that in the context of what I do as well,
[00:11:31] like, is really important to get right.
[00:11:33] So I have a whole team just dedicated to, you know,
[00:11:35] accounting and finance.
[00:11:36] And then I have other people helping
[00:11:38] with a few other areas of events and, you know, things like that.
[00:11:41] You know, it's interesting that there's sort of two approaches
[00:11:44] to investing.
[00:11:45] One approach to investing is to say that
[00:11:47] you're going to be thesis driven
[00:11:48] and you're going to look for specific things.
[00:11:51] And then the other approach is you're just opportunistic
[00:11:53] and you wait for the best things to show up.
[00:11:55] And the argument for the first one is
[00:11:57] every once in a while there's a sea change
[00:11:58] or a shift in technology that's so important
[00:12:00] that it makes sense to just go looking.
[00:12:02] And so two examples of that.
[00:12:03] In my career, I've been crypto.
[00:12:04] We're in 2016, 2017.
[00:12:07] I just started doing a lot of crypto investing
[00:12:08] because it was such a clear sea change.
[00:12:10] And I wish I'd obviously started earlier.
[00:12:12] But that's when I invested in Coinbase
[00:12:13] and other companies in that area.
[00:12:16] And then I think more recently
[00:12:18] with the generative AI wave,
[00:12:21] I ended up getting involved with that quite early, 2021, 2022.
[00:12:25] And that was, you know, I played with GPT-2
[00:12:28] and then GPT-3 and it was a shoot step function up.
[00:12:30] And all the scaling papers were out
[00:12:32] and you could just read them
[00:12:33] and see that all the stuff was coming.
[00:12:34] And so I just started looking for people working in the area.
[00:12:36] And so that's when I funded
[00:12:38] perplexity and Harvey and eventually
[00:12:40] Decagon in a bridge and a bunch of other companies.
[00:12:43] And so that was a little bit thesis-driven.
[00:12:46] Like, hey, I think this big change is happening.
[00:12:47] So let me just see who's doing what there
[00:12:49] and very few people were looking.
[00:12:51] But there's a lot of companies I invested in simply
[00:12:52] because I met the founders
[00:12:54] and I thought it was a really great company.
[00:12:55] You know, that was Airbnb and that was Stripe
[00:12:57] and that was Figma and that was Instacard
[00:13:00] and, you know, Notion and all.
[00:13:02] And so I think some of these things
[00:13:04] in hindsight feel like trends.
[00:13:06] You know, oh, there was a Fintech wave.
[00:13:08] You know, in Fintech I did Stripe Square affirm Brax.
[00:13:12] But I wasn't like, I'm a Fintech investor.
[00:13:14] I just thought it was like an important set of companies
[00:13:16] and then in hindsight, oh yeah, of course,
[00:13:17] there was this wave that was happening.
[00:13:19] So, you know, I think in general,
[00:13:21] there's thousands of great founders out there
[00:13:23] and you could think of them as a distributed search function.
[00:13:26] You have thousands of people exploring
[00:13:27] all the space of entrepreneurship.
[00:13:29] And so how can any one person or small group of people
[00:13:31] come up with better ideas and thousands of people
[00:13:33] in a distributed manner?
[00:13:34] You know, it's just impossible.
[00:13:36] But everyone's, while there's a technology
[00:13:37] shift and if you notice it, you can,
[00:13:39] you can really get involved with important things.
[00:13:40] How many companies have you invested in?
[00:13:42] Um, I don't know the exact number.
[00:13:44] So I've invested and say, um,
[00:13:47] I'm making up the number 10 to 15 companies a year
[00:13:49] but I've been doing it for 15 years.
[00:13:51] So that's between 150 to 225 if you use that as an estimate
[00:13:54] over like a really long time span.
[00:13:56] So many of those are now sold or public
[00:13:58] or dead or, you know, all the various things
[00:14:01] that can happen to a company.
[00:14:02] Can you name all of them?
[00:14:04] Oh yeah, of course.
[00:14:05] I can actually do it alphabetically
[00:14:06] and then reverse alphabetically.
[00:14:07] Are you serious?
[00:14:08] No, no.
[00:14:09] Yeah, no.
[00:14:09] Oh, come on.
[00:14:10] I think I've, yeah.
[00:14:11] So.
[00:14:12] Wow, I was really excited there.
[00:14:14] Yeah, I would have been a very long episode.
[00:14:16] Would have been great.
[00:14:16] Let's start to get bored.
[00:14:17] They'd be like, oh, he's on the S's now.
[00:14:19] It's always over slider.
[00:14:20] So many S's.
[00:14:21] It would make a good clip.
[00:14:24] I just released that on Twitter.
[00:14:25] Yeah, that'd be really.
[00:14:26] He's still going.
[00:14:27] It's so viral.
[00:14:28] I feel like, oh my god, the T's,
[00:14:30] the T's in this one are amazing.

[00:15:09] So given the fact that you've invested
[00:15:11] into so many companies through different waves,
[00:15:13] how do you think about investing in competitive companies?
[00:15:17] I'm sure there's been some crossover across.
[00:15:21] I try to be really cautious about that
[00:15:23] because I've started two companies myself.
[00:15:28] And I want to be very respectful
[00:15:33] of founders and what their goals are
[00:15:34] and their wishes are and everything else.
[00:15:36] And so I often ask both sides.
[00:15:38] I say, hey, this thing has come up.
[00:15:40] Do you view it as a conflict?
[00:15:41] It's okay for perceived, et cetera.
[00:15:43] And so I usually wait for that.
[00:15:46] I think that there's a number of circumstances
[00:15:49] where people think something's,
[00:15:50] I'd say 90% of the time,
[00:15:52] founders think that they're going to compete and they don't.
[00:15:54] They tend to go in very different directions,
[00:15:55] especially if it's to release stage companies.
[00:15:59] And then maybe a few percent of the time,
[00:16:01] things actually converge.
[00:16:02] And sometimes they actually converge
[00:16:03] in the companies that you don't expect.
[00:16:05] And so I've seen more conflicts
[00:16:07] than things that I didn't think would converge than things would.
[00:16:11] And I'll give you an example.
[00:16:12] I remember I was an investor in Square
[00:16:15] and the striped founders pinged me
[00:16:16] and asked if I wanted to invest.
[00:16:19] And so I pinged one of the key executives at Square
[00:16:21] and said, hey, do you think this is a conflict?
[00:16:24] And he said, absolutely,
[00:16:25] this is a conflict.
[00:16:26] You shouldn't do it.
[00:16:27] These things are going to collide.
[00:16:28] And so then I texted Jack
[00:16:29] and I'm like, hey, this is a conflict.
[00:16:30] I was like, no, go ahead.
[00:16:31] And so I went ahead and invested.
[00:16:33] So I'm glad I did that extra ask.
[00:16:35] And then in hindsight, they didn't really end up competing.
[00:16:37] So is it harder on the earlier stage side?
[00:16:42] There's definitely more potential for a complex,
[00:16:44] but I think most of the time it's less likely.
[00:16:46] Actually, I think on the later stage side,
[00:16:48] is usually when it's pretty clear.
[00:16:51] Or suddenly the industry shifts.
[00:16:52] And then it sort of crystallizes.
[00:16:54] And you're like, oh, wow,
[00:16:55] like cognition is now competing with Corsair.
[00:16:57] They bought Windsurf.
[00:16:58] You know, it's a more direct thing
[00:17:00] than maybe it was even six months ago.
[00:17:01] Do you think because we're in this wave of AI,
[00:17:04] you have to be an AI company in order to survive
[00:17:06] or even be relevant?
[00:17:08] Yeah, I mean, arguably anything software is just some extent AI now.
[00:17:11] And so I can't think of a modern new software company
[00:17:14] that isn't using AI.
[00:17:15] Maybe if you're truly doing something basic
[00:17:17] in Fintech or some other area, although that Fintech wave is
[00:17:21] for chunks of it are kind of over, right?
[00:17:23] There's still a lot of innovation in different areas.
[00:17:24] And new things to do and there's a lot to do in crypto.
[00:17:27] But fundamentally, you know, traditional Fintech
[00:17:31] isn't as active as it used to be.
[00:17:35] And so there may be some pockets
[00:17:36] where if you started a company today,
[00:17:37] when the AI wouldn't matter that much.
[00:17:39] And you could argue it two ways.
[00:17:41] You could say, well, if you're in the middle
[00:17:42] of one of the most important technology waves of all times,
[00:17:44] maybe you should be focused on that thing, right?
[00:17:48] And in general,
[00:17:49] early and technology waves,
[00:17:50] that's when you have all the low-hinging fruit.
[00:17:52] And so one of my pieces of advice to founders is often
[00:17:55] who are doing really hard things right now.
[00:17:57] And I'm like, why are you doing the really hard thing?
[00:17:59] Just go do the dumb, easy thing that you think is an
[00:18:01] undefensible and build defensibility
[00:18:03] because of the really hard, complex thing
[00:18:05] is something you should do in three, four years
[00:18:06] when you've run out of the easy stuff, right?
[00:18:07] And so it's almost like you're going for a walk
[00:18:10] and there's a giant mountain
[00:18:11] and there's a nice little path around it.
[00:18:12] And you're like, I'm going to go up the mountain.
[00:18:13] And you're like, well, you know,
[00:18:14] there's just take the nice path.
[00:18:18] And so I think there's that sort of overlay right now.
[00:18:20] There's easy stuff in AI.
[00:18:21] It's a good time to go do it.
[00:18:23] But you know, the flip side of it
[00:18:25] is there's lots of other areas
[00:18:26] that people are working in,
[00:18:27] although again, often AI plays a role.
[00:18:28] Like defense tech is largely drones and intelligence
[00:18:31] and other things that are, you know,
[00:18:33] really important now in the AI world.
[00:18:36] But there may be other verticals
[00:18:37] versus a little bit less important.
[00:18:38] Maybe aspects of energy, you know,
[00:18:40] like what base energy is doing with battery stores.
[00:18:43] That isn't necessarily AI enabled, right?
[00:18:45] But it's a very different type of sector industry.
[00:18:47] How do you think about the bottlenecks in AI
[00:18:50] when being energy?
[00:18:51] Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting question
[00:18:52] because energy is one of those areas
[00:18:54] where we have all sorts of solutions.
[00:18:56] We just choose not to use them, right?
[00:18:57] Nuclear is a great solution
[00:18:58] for all sorts of things of energy.
[00:19:00] And if you look at nuclear as an example,
[00:19:03] public opinion on nuclear flipped in the mid 70s, right?
[00:19:06] It went from something everybody was forward
[00:19:08] to something many people were against.
[00:19:10] And that was probably a mixture
[00:19:11] of the environmental lobby and big oil,
[00:19:13] effectively wanting to kill the industry.
[00:19:16] The US is still 18% nuclear,
[00:19:18] despite not having opened a nuclear power plant
[00:19:20] in 50 years.
[00:19:23] France is 70%.
[00:19:24] Japan is 25%.
[00:19:26] So we know that we have a clean, abundant,
[00:19:29] very safe energy source action.
[00:19:30] I don't know if you've ever heard
[00:19:31] that Wikipedia page on nuclear.
[00:19:32] That's how I spend most of my free time
[00:19:34] in section of the page.
[00:19:35] Yeah, I know the nuclear page specifically.
[00:19:36] Specifically?
[00:19:37] Yeah, I'm joking.
[00:19:38] I'm joking.
[00:19:38] I don't know.
[00:19:39] Why?
[00:19:39] Oh, yeah, that'd be awful.
[00:19:40] You're pulling jokes on me.
[00:19:41] This is unexpected.
[00:19:45] If you read that page,
[00:19:46] you basically see that a lot of the
[00:19:49] direct evidence on deaths from nuclear
[00:19:53] are very small.
[00:19:54] And in some cases,
[00:19:55] it's like in Fukushima,
[00:19:56] there was two or three deaths,
[00:19:57] and they think it was elderly people
[00:19:58] who had heart attacks, right?
[00:20:00] It wasn't necessarily from the radiation
[00:20:02] or that there may have been one death there.
[00:20:04] And so most of the deaths from nuclear
[00:20:06] that are clearly provably traced back
[00:20:08] to the nuclear accident
[00:20:09] are either Russian submarines in the 80s,
[00:20:11] which for all sorts of reasons you can imagine.
[00:20:13] And then radiology lab accidents
[00:20:16] where they misdose people.
[00:20:19] And if you compare that to stats
[00:20:21] at people dying and stalling solar
[00:20:23] by falling off of roofs,
[00:20:24] more people per year die from solar installs.
[00:20:28] And so it's very safe, right?
[00:20:30] And so we do have these things we could do
[00:20:31] societally.
[00:20:31] We choose not to,
[00:20:33] which is a different topic.
[00:20:36] But if we want to do something we can
[00:20:38] and the question is,
[00:20:38] are we going to constrain ourselves?
[00:20:40] And the best example of that is probably Europe, right?
[00:20:43] Europe's energy policy
[00:20:46] is really hurting their ability
[00:20:48] to win new data centers for training.
[00:20:51] And obviously they have extra regulation for it too
[00:20:53] that makes it worse and all these things.
[00:20:55] But fundamentally, energy costs in Europe keep going up.
[00:20:57] They shut down nuclear power plants in Germany
[00:20:59] that are working perfectly fine.
[00:21:01] They're dependent on Russian oil.
[00:21:02] There's all sorts of very bad policy decisions.
[00:21:04] But what that's doing is it's having this weird
[00:21:07] side effect of hurting their AI industry
[00:21:09] because you're not going to build new training data centers
[00:21:11] there because it's too expensive on a relative basis to run them.
[00:21:14] You may do inference because of GDPR forcing you to do it.
[00:21:18] But you're not going to do training.
[00:21:19] So all the training will probably go to places
[00:21:20] that have the cheapest, densest energy
[00:21:24] and then a proper fiber optic cable
[00:21:26] in for the data transfer.
[00:21:29] And so that's probably parts of the US.
[00:21:31] That's probably the golf.
[00:21:32] Like the golf five years ago,
[00:21:34] I never would have expected.
[00:21:35] But I think they're really going to end up
[00:21:36] with some of these data center buildouts potentially.
[00:21:39] The Trump administration,
[00:21:40] I think in their AI plan actually had
[00:21:42] the ability to sort of extend into UAE
[00:21:44] is effectively US land from the perspective of training.
[00:21:48] And so it's interesting to ask these questions
[00:21:50] of like how do global energy policies impact costs
[00:21:53] and therefore impact where AI is going to be really important
[00:21:56] as an industry, right?
[00:21:58] Because if you look at these data center buildouts
[00:22:01] they've added or they've accelerated
[00:22:03] some aspects of GDP in the US, right?
[00:22:05] It's actually a lot of money is being spent.
[00:22:07] And so Europe is shutting itself off
[00:22:08] from some of that money right now.
[00:22:10] How do you think about the new administration's approach
[00:22:14] to technology?
[00:22:16] We're going through many different waves of lots of support
[00:22:18] that to your point, nuclear AI.
[00:22:21] How do you view that and then the action afterwards?
[00:22:25] Because things come up and they're like trendy,
[00:22:27] they're cool, you get a lot of support
[00:22:29] and then you're 15 minutes of fame, like dies out.
[00:22:32] Yeah, I think it's really sector dependent.
[00:22:35] So for example, I think in crypto,
[00:22:38] the main thing the crypto industry wanted for years
[00:22:40] was just certainty.
[00:22:41] Is this something that SEC regulates the commodities folks
[00:22:45] like who governs what, what are the rules
[00:22:47] and how can we just follow the rules?
[00:22:48] And so I think a lot of the crypto industry
[00:22:50] just want to clear guidance on what to do.
[00:22:52] And that was absent for many years.
[00:22:54] And then I think this administration
[00:22:55] is starting to provide a lot of that clarity.
[00:22:58] To your point, you then need to codify it with legislation
[00:23:00] because if you don't, it's just going to be dependent
[00:23:02] on who's in power.
[00:23:03] And so you want to remove that dependence.
[00:23:04] And so I think a lot of what the crypto industry,
[00:23:06] my sense of this thinking about is,
[00:23:08] how do we pass certain bills or help certain bills
[00:23:11] progress so that we can end up in a situation
[00:23:14] where these things are codified in law
[00:23:17] and they don't just become executive orders
[00:23:19] that can be rescinded with the next administration.
[00:23:22] For AI, I think similarly, we have to be very thoughtful
[00:23:25] about it and that the dangerous part in AI was
[00:23:28] their state level initiatives that have been very negative
[00:23:32] or could have been very negative for AI.
[00:23:33] I think Scott Weiner proposed one in California.
[00:23:35] I think there's others that have been
[00:23:37] proposed in other states that you could really
[00:23:39] curtail overall US progress in AI
[00:23:41] because you set the standards in one state
[00:23:43] where it's important to function
[00:23:44] where most of the researchers are, right?
[00:23:46] Or where some of the data centers are, etc.
[00:23:49] So there's a national level of it
[00:23:52] and then there's a state level
[00:23:52] and I think both are important for some of these topics.
[00:23:55] Yeah, I think about this a lot
[00:23:57] because I love the American dynamism movement
[00:23:59] and how that like propelled small tech
[00:24:02] as the Andreessen media empire calls it to now big tech.
[00:24:07] So as we think about the government's involvement
[00:24:11] in these different sectors,
[00:24:12] they're also putting dollars to work.
[00:24:15] So how are these deals one getting structured
[00:24:17] whether it's MP materials or Intel
[00:24:20] and are you at all concerned about them
[00:24:22] and whatever happens with TikTok?
[00:24:24] Yeah, I don't have deep thoughts on those things.
[00:24:25] I haven't spent a lot of time looking at
[00:24:27] government investment in some of these companies
[00:24:30] and they very much are companies
[00:24:31] that I tend not to spend as much time with
[00:24:33] because they're much later on in life.
[00:24:34] I mean, Intel was started in the 70s
[00:24:36] and it was late 60s, I can't remember at this point.
[00:24:40] And so I just haven't thought about this very deeply.
[00:24:46] I think there's a slightly different question
[00:24:48] and I think Andreessen Horowitz for example
[00:24:49] has been very good at promoting this concept of small tech
[00:24:51] and we need to advocate for that.
[00:24:54] I do think that one thing the prior administration has done
[00:24:57] which this administration is to some extent continuing
[00:24:59] is effectively curtailing some of the M&A activity
[00:25:02] and normally see big tech participating in.
[00:25:05] And I actually think that's a negative
[00:25:06] for the startup ecosystem.
[00:25:07] I think it's good for companies to be able to exit.
[00:25:09] I think we're going through a massive sea change
[00:25:11] right now technologically.
[00:25:12] A lot of things are being innovative
[00:25:14] on that won't necessarily sustain on their own
[00:25:17] and actually having larger partners will help a lot for them.
[00:25:21] I was looking a little bit at the data from the 90s
[00:25:23] because I thought I was really interesting to say,
[00:25:24] okay, we're in this weird moment in time in AI.

[00:26:13] Do you know how many companies went public at 99?
[00:26:16] 200.
[00:26:17] It was close, 450.
[00:26:18] And then in the first, well, you know, it was within an order of magnitude.
[00:26:21] In the hundreds, it was close, in my opinion.
[00:26:23] You didn't say like 10 or, you know, 10,000.
[00:26:26] And then if you look at the first part of 2000,
[00:26:29] another 450 or so companies went public.
[00:26:32] And then before that, I'm guessing another 1,000
[00:26:34] internet companies went public.
[00:26:35] So you had 2,000 companies go public.
[00:26:39] How many of those are relevant now, or even exist, right?
[00:26:42] There's probably two or three companies that are highly relevant,
[00:26:44] very important, Amazon, and the like.
[00:26:47] And then there's probably a dozen companies that are still around
[00:26:49] that are important enough or important-ish.
[00:26:53] And then the other 1,980 companies all died or got bought, right?
[00:27:01] And so we had this massive culling of the entire ecosystem.
[00:27:04] However, it will be short period of time.
[00:27:06] And so the question is, what's the AI version of that?
[00:27:09] And how should you think about that as a founder?
[00:27:11] And how should you think about that as an investor?
[00:27:13] And there's all sorts of aspects of that.
[00:27:15] Should you sell your company or not?
[00:27:16] What are the signs you should?
[00:27:17] When should you exit?
[00:27:20] How do you think about that?
[00:27:21] Relative to what you're trying to accomplish both from an impact perspective
[00:27:25] and then also from a business perspective?
[00:27:27] And I don't think that many people are really actively thinking about that,
[00:27:30] but it is an interesting cautionary tale.
[00:27:33] What do you think is going to happen to all those companies that we're supposed to go public
[00:27:35] that are just waiting?
[00:27:37] Oh, so the backlog from 10 years ago.
[00:27:38] Yeah, the backlog.
[00:27:40] Yeah, I mean, I think a subset of them will go out.
[00:27:42] I think one interesting ship that's happened is there may be a subset of companies that are
[00:27:46] forever private because it can afford to be.
[00:27:48] That may be Stripe.
[00:27:49] That may be SpaceX.
[00:27:50] That may be some other companies.
[00:27:52] And I think it's only, I don't know if you remember the direct listing wave of like 2020 or
[00:27:57] whenever all these companies started doing DLs.
[00:27:59] And it was considered the next big thing and then like five companies did it, right?
[00:28:03] I think it's quite possible that this forever private thing will be similar.
[00:28:06] And there's a handful of companies that are marquee brands.
[00:28:08] They'll always have access to capital.
[00:28:11] And the founders have a specific way that they want to do things.
[00:28:14] And they'll just be private.
[00:28:16] And then I think there's a bunch of companies that will just do the normal IPO thing and
[00:28:21] all the rest of it.
[00:28:21] And it's kind of interesting to ask like what percentage of future market cap
[00:28:25] will be these perpetually private companies versus not?
[00:28:27] And will they eventually go public?
[00:28:29] There's also a dynamics of then kicking around capital markets and other aspects of these things.
[00:28:33] How do you view that as an investor in getting returns?
[00:28:37] Like I've never sold a share of Stripe and I hope to never do so.
[00:28:42] Or I shouldn't say never.
[00:28:43] Like for a very long time, I believe in the company.
[00:28:46] But it does impact how you think about,
[00:28:50] do they have regular tenders?
[00:28:52] Can you get liquidity?
[00:28:53] And for most companies that are doing well,
[00:28:56] you can always find some form of liquidity.
[00:28:57] The question is do you want to take it?
[00:28:59] What's the discount?
[00:29:00] And also is there pressure?
[00:29:02] And what's where to pressure?
[00:29:03] And can you avoid that pressure over time?
[00:29:04] And so how do you even structure?
[00:29:06] How do you approach investments if you're an investor?
[00:29:08] If you're a founder or similar to other maybe things that you do or don't want to do,
[00:29:11] relative to the structure or so?
[00:29:12] Do you coach any of your founders on the different exit paths?
[00:29:15] Yeah, people call me quite a bit on that stuff.
[00:29:18] And I think it's always this context dependent.
[00:29:20] I think the only good generic startup advice is that there's no good generic startup advice.
[00:29:24] So I think it's all contextual.
[00:29:26] The HubSpot CEO tweeted out,
[00:29:28] if you want to sell your company, sell it now.
[00:29:30] What do you think about that?
[00:29:32] I think that's always true.
[00:29:35] Like if you want to sell your company, you know,
[00:29:37] you probably should sell your company.
[00:29:39] I think there's usually four reasons people sell.
[00:29:42] Right?
[00:29:43] They're really tired.
[00:29:44] You're burnt out.
[00:29:45] You've been working nonstop.
[00:29:46] You're not getting any joy out of it.
[00:29:47] You're fighting with your co-founder, whatever it is.
[00:29:50] So one is just unhappy or you're tired.
[00:29:54] Two is a company's paying so far ahead
[00:29:57] that it makes sense for you to do the math and you're like,
[00:29:59] there's no way I'm going to hit that in any reasonable time frame.
[00:30:02] And some people keep going then,
[00:30:03] but rationally, it's kind of like maybe I really should get out.
[00:30:06] And the hard part is to know,
[00:30:08] is that correct or not?
[00:30:10] And I think that maybe the way I would put it is,
[00:30:12] there's a handful of companies that should never sell
[00:30:15] or should never have sold.
[00:30:16] But in some cases, they did.
[00:30:17] And maybe they did the math wrong
[00:30:19] or maybe they misunderstood their own position
[00:30:20] or something else.
[00:30:21] Right?
[00:30:23] But if you're in one of those companies,
[00:30:24] you should never sell.
[00:30:25] You should keep going.
[00:30:28] And then most other companies probably should sell.
[00:30:31] And this should just figure out the right price
[00:30:33] because most companies just don't get that big.
[00:30:34] And most companies fail.
[00:30:35] I think one thing we forgot in this era of sort of
[00:30:38] perpetual funding is that the traditional venture portfolio,
[00:30:41] you know, 50 to 80% of companies would fail outright.
[00:30:46] And even at the series B stage,
[00:30:47] it was like 40, 50% of every company fails.
[00:30:50] It's a lot of companies go out of business.
[00:30:52] And I remember there was one company.
[00:30:55] I think it was Friendster.
[00:30:56] They got offered what was it?
[00:30:58] Like a percent or two of Google at the time.
[00:31:01] As they were raising their series A.
[00:31:04] And it's possible they could have turned into Facebook.
[00:31:06] And that was a right decision.
[00:31:07] But you know, you see these companies
[00:31:08] where they really could have been these massive outsides.
[00:31:11] Outcomes if they'd sold that then, you know,
[00:31:13] in the end, it didn't necessarily work out as well.
[00:31:17] And then there's a third reason which is competitive dynamics.
[00:31:19] Like, you know, there's again a handful of reasons to actually sell.
[00:31:22] This is an interesting step because
[00:31:26] the series A, there's like such a wide gap there
[00:31:29] and a wide gap in valuation.
[00:31:30] Those companies that are actually AI companies
[00:31:33] are getting a 30% premium.
[00:31:35] Do you think that's like, do you think that's a mark of a hype cycle?
[00:31:39] Do you think that's relative?
[00:31:41] I think every time you go through a big technology shift,
[00:31:43] things are simultaneously over an underhyped.
[00:31:46] And they're
[00:31:49] underhyped because it's such a massive wave of transformation.
[00:31:52] So say you look at Azure earnings a quarter or two ago,
[00:31:56] they did, I think it was like 28 billion in revenue-ish
[00:31:59] and 10 to 15% of that was AI.
[00:32:02] So it's a few billion dollars a quarter
[00:32:05] on Azure alone for AI spend.
[00:32:07] That's enormous, right?
[00:32:08] If you extrapolate to the other clouds and everything else,
[00:32:09] that's real money.
[00:32:11] So real money is being spent on AI today
[00:32:13] and there's very little actual impact
[00:32:15] which to me means there's even more room to go.
[00:32:17] In other words, we're just in the very earliest innings
[00:32:19] of all this stuff, from adoption and usage and everything else.
[00:32:22] And there's massive adoption.
[00:32:23] You look at chat GPT, you look at cursor,
[00:32:25] you look at cognition, you look at all these things.
[00:32:27] So we already know that it's important that it works
[00:32:30] and it can really scale up.
[00:32:33] And so it's underhyped from that perspective.
[00:32:35] And then the average company is probably overhyped
[00:32:37] back to this point of 2000 IPOs
[00:32:39] and like a dozen relevant companies, right?
[00:32:41] Definitely most startups are going to fail.
[00:32:44] And this wave is going to be just like every other one
[00:32:48] and the place where every founder and investor
[00:32:50] think they are is in the right companies, right?
[00:32:53] And the reality is most people aren't, right?
[00:32:56] 90% of people are going to be in something that doesn't work.
[00:32:59] And so then the question is,
[00:33:00] can you actually tell what is good and what isn't
[00:33:03] and what's durable versus not?
[00:33:04] And there's different forms of durability.
[00:33:06] The short-term durability and long-term durability.
[00:33:07] The short-term durability was brain-tree, right?
[00:33:11] Brain-tree was a great payments company.
[00:33:14] When I funded Stripe, everybody thought,
[00:33:16] why would you fund Stripe?
[00:33:17] Brain-tree already does it.
[00:33:18] Literally, that's what people would say.
[00:33:20] And then Brain-tree eventually got bought by PayPal for,
[00:33:22] I think it was 800 million.
[00:33:23] And Stripe is now a $100 billion market cup company.
[00:33:27] And so it would have been great to be involved with brain-tree
[00:33:30] but it wouldn't even better to be involved with Stripe.
[00:33:32] And so when I look at the set of AI companies today,
[00:33:34] part of the question I ask is, is this brain-tree
[00:33:36] or is this Stripe even if it's working?
[00:33:38] Right? Because just the fact that it's working now
[00:33:40] doesn't mean that five years from now,
[00:33:41] it's going to be the important company in the market
[00:33:43] given how fast things are changing and the competitive dynamics
[00:33:45] and all the rest of it.
[00:33:46] Can you justify opening a $500 billion secondary valuation?
[00:33:51] I don't know all the details of their revenue and things like that.
[00:33:54] My sense is that for many of these foundational companies,
[00:33:58] if you just do a revenue multiple and you look at the growth rate,
[00:34:01] it's actually pretty reasonable.
[00:34:03] That's true of OpenAI, that's true of Anthropic.
[00:34:05] I think it's actually surprising.
[00:34:06] You look at it and you're like, oh my gosh,
[00:34:08] I have a lot of revenue and it's growing really fast.
[00:34:11] And obviously you look at margin structure and other things,
[00:34:13] but it actually seems like it's in the ballpark
[00:34:15] of a reasonable for many of these things.
[00:34:17] I don't know again, specifically OpenAI's latest numbers,
[00:34:21] so I can't say specifically about them.
[00:34:22] But in general, as I've looked at these things over time,
[00:34:24] it's actually been pretty reasonable.
[00:34:26] What do you think it takes to become a trillion-dollar company?
[00:34:29] Cam, just a big market.
[00:34:31] That's really the answer.
[00:34:32] Google's a giant market, AI chat or API's a giant market.
[00:34:37] Cloud businesses are giant markets.
[00:34:40] Selling productivity software plus the world's most important OS
[00:34:44] or one of the most important OS is a giant market.
[00:34:47] Selling phones to a billion people.
[00:34:49] And one of the world's most important OS is a giant business.
[00:34:51] These are giant businesses.
[00:34:53] Selling chips for everything for AI is a giant business.
[00:34:56] What do you think on the founder level?
[00:34:58] What do you think it takes for a founder to get to that level?
[00:35:02] Yeah, I think ultimately there's usually two or three characteristics.
[00:35:09] One is you have to find a giant tam and build a product people care about in it.
[00:35:13] And the question is, is that luck or is that skill?
[00:35:17] And I think for some people, I used to do this thing.
[00:35:21] I don't really do it anymore.
[00:35:22] When I meet people, I sometimes almost think of their life
[00:35:24] as like a Monte Carlo simulation.
[00:35:26] If I revend their life, which everybody does, right?
[00:35:27] It's like a standard thing people do.
[00:35:30] If you revend their life a billion times, what's the expected outcome?
[00:35:33] Or what's the average expected outcome?
[00:35:34] And for some people, you meet them and they're like, oh my gosh,
[00:35:36] this person is amazing.
[00:35:38] Their average outcome is going to be up here.
[00:35:40] And for other people, they're like, wow, this person got lucky.
[00:35:42] You know, they're not that good.
[00:35:44] And they hit that thing.
[00:35:45] And oh my gosh, what a lucky, you know, I'm not going to cost,
[00:35:48] but what a lucky person.
[00:35:52] And so usually the people running these companies are really good.
[00:35:56] And you know, it's really good finding the timer.
[00:35:59] It's really good exploiting it.
[00:36:00] And maybe it's both.
[00:36:01] I'm not sure.
[00:36:03] But the best founders tend to be very smart, very driven,
[00:36:09] very aggressive, want to win relentless work ethic.
[00:36:13] You know, it's a bunch of stuff that for a couple of years,
[00:36:15] people tried to say was important, but it's extremely important.
[00:36:18] They tend to be very smart, very strategic,
[00:36:23] able to motivate people extremely well.
[00:36:26] I don't think, and you know, people are kind of on this weird,
[00:36:28] mimetic thing about autism.
[00:36:30] They're not autistic.
[00:36:31] You know, they read people very well,
[00:36:33] whether they care about how the person's feeling in the moment
[00:36:37] may matter less or more, but they can read people very well.
[00:36:39] And they know how to motivate them and poke them.
[00:36:41] And you know, so I think a lot of that stuff
[00:36:43] gets really misunderstood.
[00:36:44] Some of them are deeply loyal and friendly people, you know.
[00:36:47] So I think there's these interesting, almost misconceptions
[00:36:51] and start-up lore about like what makes for somebody
[00:36:53] who's very effective at these highest levels.
[00:36:55] Who's an entrepreneur that you admire?
[00:36:58] I mean, Elon Musk has just accomplished amazing things.
[00:37:01] Why?
[00:37:02] Why is he accomplished them or why are they amazing?
[00:37:06] Well, I mean sending rockets into space,
[00:37:07] building a next-gen electrification companies,
[00:37:12] slash cars for the first time in the US in a long time.
[00:37:17] You know, co-founding OpenAI, like that's pretty good.
[00:37:22] It's not bad.
[00:37:22] Yeah, it's not bad, you know.
[00:37:23] He's doing okay.
[00:37:24] He's done fine, you know.
[00:37:25] I could have done better by saying, you know, it's not bad.
[00:37:28] So.
