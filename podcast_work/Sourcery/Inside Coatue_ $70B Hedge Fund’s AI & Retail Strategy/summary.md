# Investment Podcast Summary: Michael from Coatue Management

## 1. Key Themes

### **The Digital Advertising Renaissance Through AI**
AI is already generating massive revenue growth in digital advertising, representing the first major monetization wave of AI technology. "The first use case of AI truly is driving these advertising businesses to grow faster than you would have thought" [[00:00:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=39s). Michael explains that Meta's growth accelerated from expected 10% to high 20s growth rates, while Google search went from sub-10% expectations to mid-teens growth. App Lovin, a mobile gaming ad company, saw their ad business growth accelerate from 15% to 50-70% after implementing GPU-powered advertising engines [[00:09:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=9m47s). The improvement isn't just in ads - Instagram's time spent increased 15% in six months due to AI-enhanced recommendation engines [[00:14:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=14m7s).

### **Private Company Innovation Directly Impacting Public Market Valuations**
Michael emphasizes an unprecedented dynamic: "I've never seen a moment where a few private companies are impacting so much public market cap in a way like today" [[00:48:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=47m58s). Understanding the entire AI value chain - from Nvidia's GPU allocation to how cloud players deploy them to what private labs are building - is now essential for public market investing. Coatue's dual public-private strategy provides critical advantages: "The best way to figure out what's going to happen in tech is to actually talk to the practitioners of that tech" [[00:20:15]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=20m5s). This includes regular conversations with OpenAI, Anthropic researchers, and private company builders who are living and breathing the technology daily.

### **Automation Economics Will Drive Market Returns**
Michael predicts "any job that exists in the US where you work at a computer at some point can be automated, including my job" [[00:27:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=27m7s). This isn't primarily about mass layoffs today, but about hiring freezes and margin expansion. For public companies, if headcount growth stops while revenue grows 20%, "the margins are going to increase, the profit, the earnings per share growth is going to accelerate. And the stock is going to go up a lot" [[00:29:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=29m34s). Michael believes we're "at the front of a multi-year amazing run in the stock market because these companies revenues are going to go faster. Their costs are not going to be as much as you would have thought" [[00:31:15]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=31m5s).

## 2. Contrarian Perspectives

### **The GameStop Experience Revealed Retail's Structural Power**
Michael lived through Melvin Capital's collapse: "We went from at the time, probably the best performing hedge fund in the world from a return perspective, like single manager, long short equity, to basically down 50% in two weeks" [[00:03:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=2m53s). The contrarian insight isn't just that retail can move stocks - it's that "we didn't realize how powerful retail could be when they focus all their energy on the single stock" [[00:03:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=3m8s). This wasn't a traditional short squeeze with a catalyst; it was purely internet-coordinated buying. Now Coatue tracks Reddit mention frequency, Twitter trends, and WallStreetBets activity as legitimate data sources. "If you go on Wall Street bets, people are posting real work there" [[00:05:06]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=4m56s).

### **AI "Disruption" Will Actually Expand Advertising Markets**
Contrary to fears that AI agents will kill advertising, Michael sees expansion: "Those were actually not impulse purchases. Like I actually secretly wanted those things, but no one had ever shown them to me" [[00:15:59]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=15m49s). In the future agent world, instead of you asking ChatGPT for products, "it's just telling you, hey, like you're going on this trip, like I think you need a new ski coat. Or like, hey, I just found this interesting product because of a conversation that you and I were talking about in like a separate chat" [[00:16:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=16m14s). The merchant's 20% marketing budget won't disappear - the profit pool will just shift from Meta toward Shopify, OpenAI, or Gemini. "From the merchant's perspective, instead of spending, you know, 20% of my revenue on marketing in the form of ads and 2% of that is going to Shopify, that split probably changes" [[00:16:53]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=16m43s).

### **Most Investors Underestimate Both Upside and Downside Speed**
Michael's contrarian timing insight: "When things are inflecting positively...even the most bullish person in the world about how big AI could be probably under predicted the amount of GPUs you needed. And the same is true on the inverse side...that pace of disruption normally happens faster than you think" [[00:22:09]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=21m59s). He experienced this with an XAI engineer's "child IQ" analogy during the summer 2024 AI scare. The engineer explained models were already at "100 IQ" capability but needed time for applications to develop [[00:25:31]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=25m21s). This gave Michael confidence when stocks were "plummeting" - the technology was ready, implementation just lagged.

### **Reddit's Data Value Inverted With AI Evolution**
Initially, Reddit's data licensing deals seemed like one-time payments with declining marginal value: "Reddit's corpus of data is growing. But the incremental conversations that are happening are pretty small...So whatever that deal was in the beginning, it's not going to get better, right? That $50 million isn't going to go up. That was the view" [[01:03:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=1h3m26s). Michael's contrarian take: "As AI evolved, you started to realize that incremental data that happens is actually way more valuable" [[01:03:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=1h3m42s). For shopping assistants or specialized agents, Reddit's real-time human-generated product discussions become essential training data. "If he's [Zuckerberg] going to do that, what do you think Google or Open AI is willing to pay Reddit for the key piece of data that may determine the success of the entire shopping agentic tab. My guess is higher" [[01:04:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=1h4m14s).

## 3. Companies Identified

### **App Lovin**
Mobile gaming advertising platform serving ads in games like Candy Crush and mobile solitaire. "I had the CEO Adam Foroughi coming to our office...Within five minutes of meeting Adam, you knew that there was something really special here. I mean, this guy was the most locked in person I have ever met" [[00:07:58]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=7m48s). The company went from 15% growth to 50-70% ad business growth after implementing GPUs [[00:09:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=9m47s). Michael recalls: "You literally could not make the discount cash flow analysis in your worst case scenario be less than like a 3x" [[00:10:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=10m15s). Adam runs the company with "the highest EBITDA per head of any company in the world" [[00:33:09]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=32m59s) and demands all employees master AI immediately or face termination [[00:33:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=33m6s).

### **Meta (Facebook/Instagram)**
Social media and advertising giant whose AI implementation is driving unexpected growth acceleration. "I remember one of the first things I had to do was explain why Facebook could probably grow 10% or more...Well, fast forward two years, they're growing like mid to high 20s right now" [[00:09:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=9m13s). Instagram time spent "was flat for maybe 18 months to six months ago. And now...that's gone up like 15%. And just in just the past six months because they basically took those GPUs and put it at the recommendation engine" [[00:14:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=14m7s). Michael believes "Facebook is going to be a 3X in 5 years" [[00:54:11]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=54m1s) and considers them a major AI value accrual winner.

### **Reddit**
Social content platform becoming critical for AI training data. "In the AI era, there's really only one place where actual human generated content exists" [[00:59:37]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=59m27s). When AI Overviews initially disrupted Reddit's Google traffic, Coatue's data science revealed Reddit citations in AI Overviews went "from 2% to 15%...actually higher than in the old world" [[01:01:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=1h1m16s). Michael identified this as "proof that Reddit's actually more valuable in an AI world, because they're showing it more because consumers want to see it" [[01:01:51]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=1h1m41s). Initial data licensing deals at ~$50M were seen as capped, but specialized agent applications may drive significantly higher valuations.

### **OpenAI**
Foundation model company that raised at $500B valuation. "OpenAI, $500 billion around, it makes sense to me" [[00:53:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=53m3s). Michael justifies this by comparing to Facebook's $2T market cap: "They've already got all these users" - 800 million weekly active users [[00:53:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=53m25s) spending time comparable to Instagram. "Could open AI go from a $500 billion company to a $2 trillion company where Facebook is today?" [[00:54:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=53m51s). The company has "users and engagement...building modes real time. The more we're talking to chat GPT, the more information it has about us" [[00:54:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=54m14s) plus optionality in social, cloud, and other verticals not yet modeled.

### **Cursor**
Specialized AI coding agent that's become the most loved coding tool. Michael uses Cursor as a case study for the AI value chain question: "It is the most loved, most used coding agent. They figured out there's one specific area and they're crushing" [[00:50:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=49m54s). This represents one end of the spectrum - hyper-specialized with intense user adoption. The question: will specialized winners like Cursor maintain advantages, or will OpenAI's broader platform or Google's fully integrated stack (labs + cloud + TPUs + data) ultimately dominate? "I don't know the answer yet" [[00:50:47]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=50m37s).

### **Klarna**
Fintech company executing AI-driven turnaround. "Sebastian was really clear about when they were doing their turnaround, reducing headcount, freezing hiring. Now they're just waiting on attrition" [[00:32:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=32m2s). Mentioned as example of companies using AI to dramatically reduce headcount while maintaining operations.

## 4. Operating Insights

### **The Three-Sentence Pitch Test for Internal Buy-In**
Michael reveals Coatue's internal investment approval dynamic: "Can you take that thousand line Excel model and all the expert calls and all the nuances around margins and growth rates...and can you summarize it and simplify it into a three sentence pitch that when he hears that pitch, he's almost ready to buy the stock before even opening the model" [[00:45:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=45m0s). Many smart analysts fail not because their analysis is wrong, but because "they were never able to convince the person above them who's ultimately the decision maker to put that in the book" [[00:44:41]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=44m31s). Thomas Laffont is "probably the best I've ever seen at this skill. He can take something incredibly complex and get the idea down to three sentences where you hear it and you're like, that's a great idea" [[00:45:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=45m33s).

### **Weekly KPI Tracking Creates Pattern Recognition**
Coatue maintains rigorous real-time monitoring: "Every Thursday, we sit down and we have KPI tracking using some real-time data set or a mixture of them for every single company we cover. Even if we're not investing in the company, I look at that tracking every single week" [[00:57:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=57m2s). This includes credit card data, email traffic, and proprietary datasets. The discipline provides two advantages: identifying potential new ideas when "something might be changing" [[00:57:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=57m20s) and building intuition for "where we are in the broad economy...things getting faster, things slowing" [[00:58:39]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=58m29s). Michael notes ads "have been really great in the third quarter. But about a week ago, they started to slow" - this triggers immediate investigation [[00:58:56]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=58m46s).

### **Coatue Is Building The AI-Native Investment Firm**
Michael is actively rebuilding Coatue's workflows: "My belief...is how do we use AI internally? And how do we build a workforce and reimagine the workflows" [[00:34:35]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=34m25s). He estimates "85% of what I do, like basically can be done by AI" [[00:35:09]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=34m59s). The strategy: "We're hiring a class of analysts to come in and help me with this problem and basically figure out how to reimagine the workflows that we do every day" [[00:35:24]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=35m14s) - from email triage to model building to data synthesis. "In three years...those six new analysts we hire are basically sector heads with 25 agents working around the clock" [[00:35:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=35m47s). The competitive advantage: "I don't think other firms are going to adopt this that fast. And we're going to be light years ahead" [[00:36:48]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=36m38s).

## 5. Overlooked Insights

### **The Shoulder Period Data Science Advantage**
In a brief comment about recent ad tracking, Michael revealed: "Ads have been really great in the third quarter. But like, about a week ago, they started to slow. Is that consumer spending slowing? Or is that just a weird shoulder period in the time?" [[00:58:56]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=58m46s). This seemingly minor observation reveals Coatue's real-time decisioning capability - they can detect market inflections within days, not quarters. The ability to distinguish signal from noise in "shoulder periods" (transitional moments between seasons/quarters) represents a massive information asymmetry. Most investors wait for quarterly earnings; Coatue knows if spending is actually declining or just experiencing normal seasonal patterns within a week. This is the compounding informational advantage that's difficult to replicate.

### **Reddit's Citation Density in AI Overviews Signals Future Data Pricing Power**
While Michael discussed Reddit's data value evolution, the truly significant insight was buried in the specifics: In traditional Google search, Reddit appeared "maybe 10% of the time." In AI Overviews, it initially showed "2% of the time" when AI Overviews were 5% of searches. But as AI Overviews scaled to 50% of searches, Reddit's presence jumped to "15%" [[01:01:19]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLlmQoCZe2A&t=1h1m9s). This isn't just "higher than the old world" - it represents 50% increase in citation density specifically because LLMs find Reddit's human discussion format more valuable than traditional web content. This suggests the economic value of conversational human-generated content will dramatically exceed the value of traditional web content in the AI era. Reddit's real-time discussions may become infrastructure-level assets for any company building consumer-facing agents - implying order-of-magnitude increases in data licensing values, not incremental improvements. The market hasn't fully priced this structural shift from "nice to have training data" to "essential agent infrastructure."
