[00:00:00] Welcome the source.
[00:00:15] We are here in what do we call our building A. This is our research and development building.
[00:00:19] SPEAKER_02: It is a 200,000 square foot building, 50 foot clear high ceilings here.
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_02: We have a machine shop, we have a composite slab, we have a development test slab,
[00:00:27] SPEAKER_02: all of these different environments where we can prototype things quickly, test them quickly,
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_02: find the fractures, find where they break to get products built and ship trust.
[00:00:36] Thinking back to when we started Andral in 2017 is kind of the pariah of Silicon Valley.
[00:00:42] SPEAKER_05: It's not something people were doing, it was incredibly unpopular.
[00:00:45] SPEAKER_05: And now all of a sudden, it's a much cooler place than most places in Silicon Valley.
[00:00:50] SPEAKER_05: When we started the company, the idea was how do you build an apple for defense
[00:00:55] SPEAKER_05: rather than the traditional model?
[00:00:58] Landural, we are constantly inventing new products, we're moving into like totally
[00:01:02] SPEAKER_03: gnarly, hard, political and geopolitical questions and like how do we thread these
[00:01:08] SPEAKER_03: different strategies.
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_03: And that just requires constant creativity.
[00:01:13] SPEAKER_00: Artistry and meritocracy.
[00:01:15] SPEAKER_03: Artistry and meritocracy.
[00:01:16] SPEAKER_03: I'm really curious to hear from you what would war look like on the moon?
[00:01:21] What would war look like on the moon?
[00:01:25] Ryan, welcome to Sorcery.
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_00: Thank you, thanks for having me.
[00:01:32] SPEAKER_03: Thanks for having me at Andral.
[00:01:34] SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's pretty cool campus.
[00:01:36] SPEAKER_03: It's like tons of energy, old LA times printing press.
[00:01:38] SPEAKER_03: It's like, it's a very awesome space.
[00:01:40] SPEAKER_03: When you look at the industrial base, the ability to produce and the ability to
[00:01:45] SPEAKER_03: get new capabilities out quickly is one of the most innovative aspects you can have
[00:01:52] SPEAKER_03: as a defense department.
[00:01:54] SPEAKER_03: It's a war department.
[00:01:56] SPEAKER_03: And that's not where we're at.
[00:01:58] SPEAKER_03: We've had a strategy for generations which has been the decades long technological
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_03: edge is how we win.
[00:02:08] SPEAKER_03: And the US invested more, had better engineers and capitalized it more efficiently to
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_03: get to that massive technological edge.
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_03: There is still a dimension of that for sure.
[00:02:20] SPEAKER_03: But increasingly, the ability to produce at scale win away you can afford the
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_03: ability to innovate fast on the software to rapidly adapt these capabilities.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_03: That's going to be the alternative characteristic.
[00:02:33] SPEAKER_03: We see this in Ukraine.
[00:02:34] SPEAKER_03: We see this across the board.
[00:02:36] So everything he's trying to align around is this idea of how do we get capabilities
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_03: out faster to the force in a way that is affordable and effective.
[00:02:46] SPEAKER_03: Companies that can work in that world great, companies that can't, you're going to die.
[00:02:51] SPEAKER_03: And I think that's a healthy view.
[00:02:53] SPEAKER_03: What he's not saying, and I think because the reality is, is there a mix, is some of the stuff
[00:02:58] SPEAKER_03: is going to look like autonomous systems, but it's not all going to be right.
[00:03:01] SPEAKER_03: There's still going to be a place for aircraft carriers and all these things, but the balance
[00:03:05] SPEAKER_03: is going to shift.
[00:03:06] SPEAKER_03: And there's these new class of capabilities that are really relevant.
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_03: That can be more cost effective, that you can produce at scale.
[00:03:12] SPEAKER_03: And that's going to be a key aspect of what we do in the future.
[00:03:15] SPEAKER_03: And so the focus is really on industry that can perform, setting up incentives for performance
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_03: and setting up the whole acquisition system around speed.
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_03: Where prior it was entirely set up around, we just need the most expensive capabilities
[00:03:29] SPEAKER_03: at any time, at any cost.
[00:03:31] SPEAKER_03: And that's not the world we're in anymore.
[00:03:33] Do you think the nearly trillion dollar budget is reasonable or unreasonable given the amount
[00:03:42] SPEAKER_00: of efficiencies and technological advancements that we have?
[00:03:45] SPEAKER_00: And maybe for people that don't understand how it's being allocated, could you also share that?
[00:03:50] So there's a borderline trillion dollar defense budget, and everyone thinks that's like
[00:03:55] SPEAKER_03: we're buying a billion dollars of kit every year.
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_03: Well, that's not true, right?
[00:03:59] SPEAKER_03: Forget the actual percentages, but it's more than half goes to personnel costs, to facilities,
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_03: to military construction.
[00:04:09] SPEAKER_03: So you just have an outrageous percentage going to these fixed costs that you have that are not next generation technology.
[00:04:16] SPEAKER_03: And then there's an outrageous cost as well, then, to sustaining the legacy technologies you have bought.
[00:04:22] SPEAKER_03: So maintaining aircraft, maintaining ships.
[00:04:24] SPEAKER_03: These are huge bills, right?
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_03: That is significantly higher than the amount that's spent on procurement.
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_03: And when you look at this in terms of historic terms, the procurement budget as a percentage of GDP, for example,
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_03: is I think the lowest it's ever been.
[00:04:40] And so we're not spending money on the new technology.
[00:04:43] SPEAKER_03: We're spending money on sustaining the old technology.
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_03: We're spending money on all the infrastructure that we have to have a global military.
[00:04:52] SPEAKER_03: And that is very expensive.
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_03: So now you're really talking about how do I get efficiency out of, you know, call it the 30% of the budget that you're actually maneuvering around.
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_03: And in that world, you know, there's a good argument, which is we could be spending that money a lot more efficiently.
[00:05:09] SPEAKER_03: I think that is true. It's hard to argue we couldn't.
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_03: How much more efficiently? I don't know.
[00:05:13] SPEAKER_03: But, you know, I tend to think we can get a lot more bang for a buck on weapons, on aircraft.
[00:05:19] SPEAKER_03: You'll probably 2x from where we are.
[00:05:22] But just looking at a different mix of these things.
[00:05:25] But the hard part is we got to transition to that world.
[00:05:27] SPEAKER_03: Right? So we're not, we can't just jump to that and say,
[00:05:30] SPEAKER_03: all of a sudden we're going to abandon all of our, you know, man's surface combatants and move to this autonomous future or something like that.
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_03: Like that's just not believable.
[00:05:38] SPEAKER_03: So we're going to have to go through this transition, which is sort of always true of how do we responsibly cycle out the old,
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_03: think about what's still fit for purpose or not, and then get the new systems in place.
[00:05:50] SPEAKER_03: That will cost more for a period of time.
[00:05:52] SPEAKER_03: Right? And that is a hard world to live in.
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_03: And so I don't see a world where like the defense budgets could magically shrink and we still have the military that we need to have.
[00:06:02] SPEAKER_03: But I do think these things can be done wildly more efficiently than they ever have in the past.
[00:06:07] SPEAKER_03: I want to talk about Anderl's expansion.
[00:06:10] SPEAKER_00: You have a global expansion, whether it's the facility in Australia or the new deal with edge and the UAE.
[00:06:17] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_00: Let's maybe start with Australia and building out ghosts shark there.
[00:06:22] Yeah. Australia is a great example.
[00:06:24] SPEAKER_03: So sitting in the context maybe a little broadly, we're in a period where things are just geopolitically more unstable.
[00:06:30] SPEAKER_03: People like to talk about this that we're in this time of peace, but doesn't seem all that peaceful to me.
[00:06:35] SPEAKER_03: We've got a land war in Europe.
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_03: The Red Sea is still, you know, intermittently shut down.
[00:06:40] SPEAKER_03: Israel and Iran going at it.
[00:06:42] SPEAKER_03: You've got China doing constant aggression on the Philippines and the South China Sea.
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_03: Cambodia and Thailand are sparring all the time right now.
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_03: India, Pakistan doing air wars and doing, you know, air combat.
[00:06:53] SPEAKER_03: I'm probably forgetting several of these going on right now.
[00:06:56] SPEAKER_03: And so we're not in a time of peace, right?
[00:06:58] SPEAKER_03: Like this is not a stable time.
[00:07:00] SPEAKER_03: And so something has changed, right?
[00:07:02] SPEAKER_03: Like there's a sense that a lot of historic grievances, the political opportunism to use violence to get to your ends that has changed.
[00:07:13] SPEAKER_03: And every nation's reflecting it where they're increasing defense spending, they're ramping up their own defense.
[00:07:19] SPEAKER_03: And I think the view of what the US is going to do or not do, I mean everyone's behalf has shifted.
[00:07:24] SPEAKER_03: The US reasonably is saying we're not going to go fight everyone else's wars.
[00:07:28] SPEAKER_03: We're going to expect every nation to provide for their own defense.
[00:07:32] SPEAKER_03: And that also does not imply the US is backing away as the sort of security guarantee for the world, right?
[00:07:38] SPEAKER_03: Like we still have the only blue water navy in at scale that is able to project force anywhere and sort of multiple parts of the globe all the time.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_03: Can guarantee international shipping and stability of the seas.
[00:07:50] SPEAKER_03: All these things we're still going to do as America that are very aligned to our interests and aligned to the system that we have.
[00:07:58] SPEAKER_03: So that's the whole backdrop that's going on.
[00:08:00] SPEAKER_03: There's a whole lot of other pieces to this.
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_03: And on top of it, the backlogs on like you want to order Patriot missiles.
[00:08:07] SPEAKER_03: I'm hearing right now the latest number.
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_03: So I told me over the weekend was 15 years to get a new Patriot system.
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_03: Like, what does that even mean?
[00:08:16] SPEAKER_03: Like I have no idea what that means, right?
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_03: But it's like call it even five to seven for a backlog.
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_03: Like this is crazy.
[00:08:21] SPEAKER_03: So the US is in the dependable producer anymore.
[00:08:24] SPEAKER_03: Can't get the weapons in time.
[00:08:26] SPEAKER_03: This is resulted in basically every country looking a little bit differently and how they're going to think about well when they are ramping spending.
[00:08:35] SPEAKER_03: What does that mean and what do they want to be true?
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_03: They're all going to look at a question of if we're going to spend a lot of money we should get some economic benefit.
[00:08:44] SPEAKER_03: But probably more importantly, we need to have a short supply.
[00:08:48] SPEAKER_03: We need to know that if we order this, this shows up and that we want to shape our military for what we needed to be for our country.
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_03: We need to be for our regional challenges.
[00:08:58] SPEAKER_03: Australia is a great example of this.
[00:09:00] SPEAKER_03: They shut down their French submarine program.
[00:09:02] SPEAKER_03: They're going all in on the US nuclear submarine programs.
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_03: That's not going to show up for until 2035.
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_03: So this major gap about a decade where their old technology was phasing out and they were waiting on this next generation capability to come in.
[00:09:17] SPEAKER_03: We went and pitched them on this idea of you could build these extra large autonomous underwater vehicles.
[00:09:22] SPEAKER_03: You can build them fast and we did this model of splitting the development 50-50.
[00:09:26] SPEAKER_03: They had skin of the game. We did two and we ended up executing that program incredibly quickly.
[00:09:31] SPEAKER_03: And to their credit, they saw the opportunity and said yes, basically immediately.
[00:09:35] SPEAKER_03: They said yes and just a couple of months and we were signed in under contract.
[00:09:39] SPEAKER_03: And we were able to deliver at pace.
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_03: We build out an Australian engineering team.
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_03: We built out an Australian production facility.
[00:09:48] SPEAKER_03: We have our first production go shark.
[00:09:51] SPEAKER_03: Already ranked came off the production line.
[00:09:53] SPEAKER_03: Then I think 30 days of signing the production contract.
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_03: So just an incredibly fast pace that shows what you can actually do.
[00:09:59] SPEAKER_03: If you just hit go on this.
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_03: And we want to replicate that model in a number of other countries.
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_03: It's not going to look all the same.
[00:10:06] SPEAKER_03: There's not that many places that will do fully ground up capabilities.
[00:10:09] SPEAKER_03: But this idea of integrating into their military, helping them think about ways they can use technology to modernize, do warfare differently.
[00:10:17] SPEAKER_03: And understanding a more nuanced approach to how they're going to get local engineering and local production that fits.
[00:10:26] SPEAKER_03: Well, still being aligned with the US, which is still again the backstop of world security.
[00:10:32] SPEAKER_03: Everyone needs that US alliance.
[00:10:35] SPEAKER_03: And so this is just a very nuanced complicated thing to actually solve for.
[00:10:40] SPEAKER_03: But the numbers are pretty clear. Europe is going to spend something like four times the amount of procurement that the US is.
[00:10:46] SPEAKER_03: Over the next five years.
[00:10:48] SPEAKER_03: Like it's a massive build up.
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_03: Japan's going to substantially increase their budget.
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_03: Taiwan's increasing their budget. Australia.
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_03: Like everyone is ramping.
[00:10:57] SPEAKER_03: So that problem I talked about with the US having so much in sustainment and keeping the legacy going.
[00:11:01] SPEAKER_03: So the countries won't have that problem as much.
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_03: They have an opportunity to build new and build efficiently.
[00:11:06] SPEAKER_03: And something we very much want to help them with.

[00:12:49] SPEAKER_00: Good to be here. How's it going?
[00:12:51] SPEAKER_00: Welcome to sorcery.
[00:12:52] SPEAKER_05: Thank you.
[00:12:53] SPEAKER_00: Thanks for having me at Anderl.
[00:12:54] It's a much cooler place than most places in Silicon Valley.
[00:12:58] SPEAKER_05: You wrote the factory is really the weapon?
[00:13:00] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:13:01] SPEAKER_05: You know, for decades and decades, the United States was the global manufacturing powerhouse.
[00:13:06] SPEAKER_05: I mean, we had the ability during World War II to outproduce our adversaries.
[00:13:11] SPEAKER_05: And, you know, your company is like Ford that turned over their production lines to build bombers for the Allied War effort.
[00:13:18] SPEAKER_05: Fast forward to the last 30 years, the fall of the Soviet Union.
[00:13:22] SPEAKER_05: We've atrophied massively in our manufacturing chops.
[00:13:26] SPEAKER_05: We off-shoreed a lot of manufacturing work to lower cost labor locations like China.
[00:13:33] SPEAKER_05: And not only did they soak up a lot of that manufacturing capacity,
[00:13:37] SPEAKER_05: but they also developed advanced tooling and know-how to build the things that, you know, we use every day.
[00:13:44] SPEAKER_05: Whether it's, you know, the microphones that we're wearing today are the iPhones that are in our pockets.
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_05: And so, at this point, even if there was complete labor cost parity,
[00:13:52] SPEAKER_05: we still don't have the ability to just magically reshore a lot of these critical components
[00:13:58] SPEAKER_05: that are going to be important to the next 50 or 100 years.
[00:14:01] SPEAKER_05: And so, you know, we're in this place where we really need to re-industrialize.
[00:14:05] SPEAKER_05: It's incredibly important.
[00:14:06] SPEAKER_05: It's incredibly important.
[00:14:08] SPEAKER_05: Culturally, geopolitically, strategically.
[00:14:11] SPEAKER_05: And, you know, this is what Anderl is really focused on right now.
[00:14:14] SPEAKER_05: It's bringing back our ability to not build hundreds of things or thousands of things,
[00:14:18] SPEAKER_05: but tens of thousands of things or hundreds of thousands of things,
[00:14:22] SPEAKER_05: efficiently, scalably, and to do it in a way that enables us to retain that, like, magazine and inventory advantage against our adversaries.
[00:14:31] SPEAKER_05: And so, I think that's really what I was saying with the factory is the weapon,
[00:14:35] SPEAKER_05: because without the factory, you have no weapons.
[00:14:37] SPEAKER_05: Are you also outsourcing and finding different ways to manufacture?
[00:14:40] SPEAKER_00: We have a lot of manufacturing partners.
[00:14:42] SPEAKER_05: Obviously, we're not building every subcomponent of everything that we're building.
[00:14:46] SPEAKER_05: So, we're, you know, working with other vendors, we're working with other machine shops,
[00:14:50] SPEAKER_05: we're working with other manufacturers, and then we're pulling it all together generally in our own facilities.
[00:14:56] SPEAKER_05: But, you know, we're in the first quarter of next year, we'll be opening our soon to be 5 million square foot factory campus called Arsenal 1,
[00:15:03] SPEAKER_05: just outside of Columbus, Ohio, which is where we'll start ramping up our collaborative combat aircraft
[00:15:08] SPEAKER_05: to the autonomous fighter plane production.
[00:15:10] SPEAKER_05: And we have other facilities around the country.
[00:15:12] SPEAKER_05: We have, you know, shipyards. We have a lunar munition assembly that's happening in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:15:19] SPEAKER_05: You know, we do some stuff right here in Costa Mesa at our headquarters.
[00:15:22] SPEAKER_05: So, I imagine that there will be multiple factories across, not just the United States, but across Allied and partner nations as well,
[00:15:30] SPEAKER_05: where we're ramping that manufacturing muscle at the same time.
[00:15:33] SPEAKER_05: What was it like to open up Arsenal 1?
[00:15:35] SPEAKER_00: I know it's under development, but choosing Ohio where you're from, what was it like?
[00:15:40] SPEAKER_05: Yeah, at some point when we got down to like the final three states, I realized that the bias was going to look really bad to the company.
[00:15:48] SPEAKER_05: So, I just kind of sat back and I'm like, you know what, I don't want to push this.
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_05: I think Ohio is great, obviously, as a native of Ohio, and I thought it would be awesome to land there.
[00:15:57] SPEAKER_05: Opening something so large, like that, does this feel real? I mean, primes have existed for a very long time, but you're known as the new prime.
[00:16:06] SPEAKER_00: So, how does that physicality feel?
[00:16:09] SPEAKER_05: Well, I'm certainly experiencing the realness of it with all the LinkedIn messages from my high school classmates that I haven't heard from in 20 years that are now looking for jobs.
[00:16:17] SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
[00:16:18] SPEAKER_05: So, it feels pretty real.
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_05: Now, I mean, one of the cool things to remember is that Ohio is the birthplace of aviation.
[00:16:25] SPEAKER_05: And so, in some ways, it's like you're starting with the right flyer and then coming back with fully autonomous fighter plans to be built less than an hour drive away from where the right brothers were building the first air.
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_05: And so, there's a tremendous history, GE aviation, GE aircraft where they build the jet engines is also right down the street about an hour away from where we're setting up the factory.
[00:16:47] SPEAKER_05: So, it's a cool kind of cultural moment, I think, not only for us and what we're trying to deliver to the department, but also to the state of Ohio.
[00:16:55] SPEAKER_05: One thing that was kind of the central focus of our interview with Alex Carr was like moral and ethics around this.
[00:17:02] SPEAKER_00: Christian Garrett, he's a big fan of you.
[00:17:05] SPEAKER_00: We've done so many interviews with him at this point. He's great.
[00:17:08] SPEAKER_00: But his, one of his questions he wanted me to ask you was about the Just War Theory and St. Augustine.
[00:17:14] SPEAKER_00: So, how does that play into all of this?
[00:17:16] SPEAKER_00: I mean, since the very beginning, this was always a big part of the conversation that I was drawing the rest of the team into is Just War Theory, which was developed, you know, over a thousand years ago by St. Augustine,
[00:17:28] SPEAKER_05: talks about how you engage in lethal defense activity in the most ethical way possible.
[00:17:37] SPEAKER_05: And if you look back at the course of all human civilization, you had this massive ramp up in lethality.
[00:17:44] SPEAKER_05: So, we started with like hitting each other with rocks and then it was like, you know, at some point somebody was building and making a knife and then someone makes bow and arrow and then you have catapults that could do like one to many destruction,
[00:17:55] SPEAKER_05: trebuchets, and then you have the advent of gunpowder, so you have guns and simple bombs.
[00:18:01] SPEAKER_05: And that just kept going up and up until the atomic bomb in 1945.
[00:18:06] SPEAKER_05: And at that moment, I think humanity looked around at each other and they said, I don't think we want to do this.
[00:18:12] SPEAKER_05: Like, global nuclear war is a pretty bad bet.
[00:18:15] SPEAKER_05: And so, from then until modern day, you see the climb back down the ladder.
[00:18:20] SPEAKER_05: And so, you had precision guided munitions.
[00:18:23] SPEAKER_05: You see, like some of the counterterrorism work we were doing was literally shooting non-explosive AIM-9X missiles into windows to take out individual targets without blowing up buildings, no collateral damage.
[00:18:35] SPEAKER_05: We've become really, really good at being accurate.
[00:18:38] SPEAKER_05: And so, people are constantly talking about kind of the freak out of the intersection of AI and defense and autonomy and what does that do from an ethics perspective.
[00:18:48] SPEAKER_05: The goal is take humans out of dull, dirty, dangerous jobs.
[00:18:53] SPEAKER_05: So, we're not putting our men and women, brothers and sisters in horribly dangerous situations and become as accurate and precise as possible.
[00:19:03] SPEAKER_05: And that's really what Just War Theory is all about.
[00:19:05] SPEAKER_05: Principles of discrimination, principles of just cause.
[00:19:09] SPEAKER_05: Like, how good is the information?
[00:19:11] SPEAKER_05: Do we know for sure that this action that we're going to take is actually going to address the problem that needs to be solved?
[00:19:17] SPEAKER_05: So, this is very, it's a big part of andural culture.
[00:19:20] SPEAKER_05: We talk about these things internally a lot.
[00:19:22] SPEAKER_05: And I think we would only do something that we fundamentally believe would be better, more just for humanity.
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_05: Where do you get pushback on that?
[00:19:31] SPEAKER_00: I mean, there's a lot of pushback from people who don't necessarily understand why defense is important.
[00:19:38] SPEAKER_05: You know, pacifism as an idea is only possible inside of a governing system with a monopoly on violence.
[00:19:45] SPEAKER_05: Like, you can't be a pacifist without a government monopoly on violence.
[00:19:50] SPEAKER_05: That's just like not possible for humanity.
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_05: And so, I'm glad that people get to have these positions, these kind of anti-national security positions where they can sink down into their comfy couch with their hot chocolate and talk about pacifism because it means that someone out there is willing to risk their lives.
[00:20:07] SPEAKER_05: To protect their ability to be pacifists. So, I'm all for it.
[00:20:12] SPEAKER_05: Do you have any cultural commentary on what's going on in America right now?
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_00: I think culture is really hard to predict.
[00:20:18] SPEAKER_05: I mean, we've seen big shifts even in the last 10 years that I don't think I would have expected.
[00:20:23] SPEAKER_05: You know, there's a lot of surveys that show that for the first time in modern civilization, more men in the most recent generation in Gen Z going to church than women.
[00:20:35] SPEAKER_05: It's like that has never happened before.
[00:20:37] SPEAKER_05: 10 years ago, if you had asked me, do you think Gen Z will have a rising church attendance and it will be more men than women?
[00:20:43] SPEAKER_05: I would have gotten that answer totally wrong.
[00:20:45] SPEAKER_05: So, I'm not sure that I would be able to predict this stuff necessarily.
[00:20:49] SPEAKER_05: But I think, you know, you've probably seen the meme like, you know, hard times create serious men, serious men create it easy to...
[00:20:57] SPEAKER_05: I think that's kind of the moment we're in.
[00:20:59] SPEAKER_05: As people realize that being serious is very important.
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_05: And there's more important stuff out there than monkey J pegs and, you know, AI Slop.
[00:21:08] SPEAKER_05: And I think it's an opportunity for people to step into a good quest.
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_05: And so, I'm hopeful at least that we're in a moment of a transition from Slop to Good Questing.

[00:22:03] SPEAKER_00: Some of you may not have heard this yet, but our sponsor public just launched something called generated assets.
[00:22:09] SPEAKER_00: And it brings AI into investing in a way I've honestly never seen before.
[00:22:13] SPEAKER_00: Here's how it works. You type in an idea like AI-powered supply chain companies with positive free cash flow,
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_00: or defense tech companies growing revenue over 25% year over year.
[00:22:23] SPEAKER_00: Public's AI then dispatches a swarm of agents that scan every single US stock, evaluates them,
[00:22:28] SPEAKER_00: and instantly builds a custom index around your thesis.
[00:22:31] SPEAKER_00: What really stands out is how clearly it explains why each stock is included.
[00:22:35] SPEAKER_00: And before you invest, you can even back test your idea against the S&P 500,
[00:22:39] SPEAKER_00: so you're making decisions with real context, not just guessing.
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_00: And beyond generated assets, public lets you invest in stocks, bonds, options, crypto, all in one place.
[00:22:49] SPEAKER_00: They'll even give you an uncapped 1% match when you transfer your investments over from another platform.
[00:22:54] SPEAKER_00: If you want to build a portfolio that actually reflects your thesis, visit public.com slash sorcery,

[00:23:03] SPEAKER_00: Paul Verlukking, welcome to sorcery.
[00:23:06] SPEAKER_00: Thank you for coming to Android HQ, former Los Angeles Times printing the press.
[00:23:11] SPEAKER_04: It's a lot of fun. I mean, you can see where we cut all of their machines out of the floor even.
[00:23:15] SPEAKER_04: So, you know, we didn't actually rebuild the floor.
[00:23:18] SPEAKER_04: We just went in with a grinder and cut out all of their machines.
[00:23:21] SPEAKER_00: And you're building something similar, right?
[00:23:23] SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah, very similar. All kinds of cool stuff.
[00:23:26] SPEAKER_00: So I'd love for you to just maybe walk through one or two of your favorite things here.
[00:23:31] Sure. So this is our public showroom.
[00:23:33] SPEAKER_04: We have another one that's full of stuff that I can't show to anybody without permission from the government.
[00:23:37] SPEAKER_04: But of the things that are in this showroom, one of these were most proud of lately is Fury.
[00:23:42] SPEAKER_04: Also known as the FQ 44.
[00:23:45] SPEAKER_04: This is the first autonomous fighter that the United States Air Force has ever procured.
[00:23:51] SPEAKER_04: We recently just flew it for the first time.
[00:23:54] SPEAKER_04: We went from signing a contract with the Air Force to first flight in 556 days,
[00:23:58] SPEAKER_04: which is as far as I know, the fastest new fighter development program since the end of the Korean War.
[00:24:03] SPEAKER_04: The really exciting thing about this program is we're competing against a lot of the big guys.
[00:24:07] SPEAKER_04: So we're going to be building North Grumman Lockheed Martin.
[00:24:11] SPEAKER_04: And in the end, Andrew will beat all of them, which was really really gratifying to go from starting this company to going toe to toe
[00:24:20] SPEAKER_04: with the guys who are legends of the fighter community and actually get selected to build something built build something to fly.
[00:24:28] SPEAKER_04: So it's an AI powered fighter jet that flies alongside man fighter.
[00:24:31] SPEAKER_04: So imagine if I had an F 35 pilot, he might fly with two or three or four or five of these alongside with him,
[00:24:38] SPEAKER_04: extending his weapons, webs forward, his sensors forward and allowing them to engage in risks that you would never want a person to do.
[00:24:46] SPEAKER_04: You know, there's a lot of ways to win a fight and live to see another day.
[00:24:51] SPEAKER_04: There's a lot of ways to win a fight and sacrifice pawns on the board.
[00:24:56] SPEAKER_04: And autonomy means that you can do that without the ethical problems of, you know, just throwing away human lives.
[00:25:04] And what do you think this costs you compared to what the government would cost down?
[00:25:08] SPEAKER_00: I think that we're in general much more efficient than the government.
[00:25:12] SPEAKER_04: We've done a pretty good job. Andrews up.
[00:25:14] SPEAKER_04: We like to think you are of our approach as being a defense products company, not a defense contractor.
[00:25:20] SPEAKER_04: That is we're not getting paid to engage in contracted work where they say go and do, you know, this many hours of work to build exactly this thing.
[00:25:29] SPEAKER_04: Instead, we're investing our own money in building what we think the right products are and then we sell them to the government.
[00:25:34] SPEAKER_04: So we want to be going to the government generally with a product rather than a PowerPoint or at least a prototype instead of a presentation.
[00:25:43] SPEAKER_04: And that's gone really, really well for us.
[00:25:46] SPEAKER_04: It leads to way better incentive structures.
[00:25:48] SPEAKER_04: We make more money when we move faster rather than more money when we move more slowly.
[00:25:52] SPEAKER_04: We make more money when things work the first time rather than more money when it takes 10 tries.
[00:25:56] SPEAKER_04: And you can imagine which of those leads to better outcomes.
[00:25:59] SPEAKER_04: How far do you think we are from invisibility cloaks and masking?
[00:26:03] SPEAKER_00: And I don't mean by radar.
[00:26:05] And that's a visible spectrum.
[00:26:07] SPEAKER_00: Visible spectrum.
[00:26:08] SPEAKER_00: Visible, yes.
[00:26:09] That's actually a lot easier.
[00:26:10] SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah, ways here.
[00:26:12] SPEAKER_04: It's a lot harder to hide from synthetic systems.
[00:26:15] SPEAKER_04: So if you're talking about like radars or light hours or there's a large number of ways that you can see the world that are not just visible spectrum imaging.
[00:26:24] SPEAKER_04: People are actually relatively easy to fix.
[00:26:26] SPEAKER_04: You know, Andrew has a project going way back building optical camouflage for the ghost helicopter drone that we make.
[00:26:32] SPEAKER_04: And it's essentially a projection system that looks at the target, looks behind.
[00:26:37] SPEAKER_04: It looks at where the target is.
[00:26:39] SPEAKER_04: Knows where you are.
[00:26:40] SPEAKER_04: Looks behind you.
[00:26:41] SPEAKER_04: And it calculates the luminance and color values that you would need to match whatever is between your target you're surveilling and the background.
[00:26:49] SPEAKER_04: So that might be the sky.
[00:26:50] SPEAKER_04: That might be a mountain.
[00:26:51] SPEAKER_04: It might be a cloud.
[00:26:52] SPEAKER_04: It might be a cloud.
[00:26:53] SPEAKER_04: It's not that hard.
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_04: And our eyes don't have very good resolution.
[00:26:56] SPEAKER_04: You know, ghosts is very neurofrontal cross section.
[00:26:58] SPEAKER_04: And so it was actually designed partly to make itself very workable with optical camouflage.
[00:27:03] SPEAKER_04: So building drones that are invisible to the human eye at the ranges that you're using them.
[00:27:10] SPEAKER_04: It's not just like a hypothetical.
[00:27:12] SPEAKER_04: Andrew did this in like 2019, 2020.
[00:27:15] SPEAKER_04: You know, actually, let me see if I can find.
[00:27:17] SPEAKER_04: Let me see if I can find something for you.
[00:27:18] SPEAKER_04: I might have a picture I can pull up of some of those tests.
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_04: And invisible.
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, invisible drone.
[00:27:23] SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
[00:27:24] Oh my gosh.
[00:27:25] We're looking for an invisible drone right now.
[00:27:28] So what we did is down here at the end, we had our drone with the system turn on and off.
[00:27:33] SPEAKER_04: So this is a ghost drone, just the body of it.
[00:27:35] SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
[00:27:36] SPEAKER_04: Like not without without without the landing gear attached.
[00:27:39] SPEAKER_04: And we put it up on this tripod.
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_04: And we're testing it against the truck and then also the sky.
[00:27:45] SPEAKER_04: Because it's a very, very different system.
[00:27:46] SPEAKER_04: So we're moving up and down to view, you know, to make it change color as the observer moved.
[00:27:51] SPEAKER_04: But this is with optical camouflage disabled.
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_04: See how you can clearly see the body as the sky.
[00:27:56] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:27:57] That's so easy.
[00:27:58] SPEAKER_00: See how you can see this ever so slight disturbance.
[00:28:00] SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
[00:28:01] SPEAKER_04: See how it's perfect.
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_04: And it lines up and we can't.
[00:28:03] SPEAKER_04: The goal was it.
[00:28:04] SPEAKER_04: And by the way, you'll see how the body is also copying the truck as well.
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_04: Right.
[00:28:10] SPEAKER_04: So in this case, it was turned off and then we turned it on.
[00:28:12] SPEAKER_04: So it has to have part of itself be the sky, part of it be the truck.
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_04: And it's a very, very difficult high contrast problem to do both at the same time.
[00:28:18] SPEAKER_04: If you're all in the air, it's even easier.
[00:28:20] SPEAKER_04: The point is, visible spectrum optical hemophlogs is actually quite easy.
[00:28:24] SPEAKER_04: But something like this would be trivially easily seen by, you know, an infrared camera,
[00:28:28] SPEAKER_04: thermal camera, layout, you know, light R radar.
[00:28:31] SPEAKER_04: So the biggest problem with optical camouflage.
[00:28:34] SPEAKER_04: And the main reason you don't see a lot of money being put towards it in the modern defense bases,
[00:28:40] SPEAKER_04: it's not actually that useful.
[00:28:42] SPEAKER_04: It's useful against human adversaries who do not have any other technology to aid them.
[00:28:48] SPEAKER_04: And those are not really the enemies the United States is focused on stopping these days.
[00:28:52] SPEAKER_04: So like, for example, you might notice ghost doesn't come with optical camouflage.
[00:28:57] All of our customers have been briefed on this.
[00:28:59] SPEAKER_04: They've seen this.
[00:29:00] SPEAKER_04: Their point is, Paul, I'm not going up against a bunch of guys, you know,
[00:29:03] SPEAKER_04: who are walking around with their naked eyes and nothing else.
[00:29:06] SPEAKER_04: These are people who are, we are concerned about adversaries like Russia and China in Iran
[00:29:11] SPEAKER_04: that are armed with very, very high levels of technology.
[00:29:15] SPEAKER_04: And there, if anything, the optical camouflage in some ways actually makes you easier to spot.
[00:29:19] SPEAKER_04: So you don't think UAPs use optical camouflage?
[00:29:23] SPEAKER_04: To the, there's a lot of, we don't understand about these vehicles and what they are,
[00:29:27] SPEAKER_04: where or when they come from.
[00:29:29] SPEAKER_04: But it is likely that whatever they are doing is a side effect or an artifact of what's going on.
[00:29:38] SPEAKER_04: Like, I've talked about this with the people.
[00:29:40] SPEAKER_04: They're like, well, you know, how come, how come, you know, how come, like, sometimes they're invisible in certain spectrums.
[00:29:45] SPEAKER_04: And my point is, well, like, what if they are not interacting with reality itself in a way you would expect?
[00:29:50] SPEAKER_04: Like, some of these things that you see that, then they don't have any radar signature either.
[00:29:54] SPEAKER_04: I don't know if that means they're cloaking themselves actively or if it means that just they do not exist even in the way that we think about physical matter.
[00:30:02] SPEAKER_04: I don't know if it's an active countermeasure so much as the nature of the thing itself.
[00:30:07] SPEAKER_04: But of course, there's so much that we don't know.
[00:30:09] SPEAKER_04: My current working theory is that they come from the past.
[00:30:13] SPEAKER_04: Interesting.
[00:30:14] SPEAKER_04: Coming from the future is too hard.
[00:30:16] SPEAKER_04: The physics just don't seem to work out.
[00:30:18] SPEAKER_04: But if you think about it, think about it in a certain perspective.
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_04: Like, there's a question of where they come from.
[00:30:23] SPEAKER_04: Like, do they come from Earth?
[00:30:24] SPEAKER_04: Do they come from nearby?
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_04: Do they come from really, really far away?
[00:30:27] SPEAKER_04: Wherever they come from, you know, spatially,
[00:30:30] SPEAKER_04: the question that is, okay, temporally, what is more likely that they happen to have come from this particular instant in time?
[00:30:37] SPEAKER_04: Or the hundreds of millions or billions of years that it is existent prior to our existence?
[00:30:42] SPEAKER_04: That could be true if they were just like waiting around and then came over, you know, at some point.
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_04: It could be the case if they are regularly surveying and have just been around for a long time.
[00:30:51] SPEAKER_04: You could imagine a world where maybe the Earth hosted advanced civilizations a billion years ago.
[00:30:55] SPEAKER_04: And we just don't even know about them and these are the remnants of that.
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_04: I'm not betting on any of these.
[00:31:00] SPEAKER_04: It's just that where ever they come from geographically, there's a very, very long tail of time.
[00:31:07] SPEAKER_04: And also there's ways to travel forward through time very quickly.
[00:31:10] SPEAKER_04: You know, if I create a very strong gravity distortion, I can have subjective time inside of that bubble passing very, very slowly relative to the time racing by outside of it.
[00:31:20] SPEAKER_04: And so it's very believable that something from the distant past could come to our present.
[00:31:24] SPEAKER_04: Not really believable that something can come from the future back into our present.
[00:31:28] SPEAKER_04: So that's my bet is basically given that there's been a lot more time before now than now.
[00:31:35] Just probabilistically speaking, I think it's likely these things have been around for a very long time.
[00:31:41] SPEAKER_04: That's just my not saying I know, but I'm not saying some ideas.
[00:31:45] SPEAKER_00: I'm not saying I know what's up. I'm saying that is my current guess based on what I know.
[00:31:50] SPEAKER_04: Interesting.
[00:31:51] SPEAKER_00: Not good. Yes. Thanks for having me here. Where are we?
[00:31:54] SPEAKER_00: We are here at Andrews headquarters in Costa Mesa, California in Orange County, just south of LA.
[00:31:59] SPEAKER_02: So we're about eight and a half years old now. So we were founded in early 2017.
[00:32:03] SPEAKER_02: And our first office was a 5,000 square foot, I think it was 4,900 something just under 5,000 square foot garage that used to be American Airlines storage facility for lost luggage.
[00:32:15] SPEAKER_02: So if you flew to John Wayne Airport and you lost your bag, American Airlines would store it in this garage and just leave it there until someone claimed it or whatever.
[00:32:24] SPEAKER_02: So it had it had mold on the walls. It had no bathroom. We had to put our own bathroom in.
[00:32:29] SPEAKER_02: It had no air conditioning. It had no ventilation. It was just a like storage shed that was where we where we got started.
[00:32:36] SPEAKER_02: So we started on our first day with 10 employees, just the five, the five co-founders of us and our first five employees and just had a couple ideas.
[00:32:45] SPEAKER_02: There's a famous picture of us brainstorming ideas of what to work on with just a bunch of ideas on the whiteboard.
[00:32:50] SPEAKER_02: And that's what led to originally the century tower for border security deployments and then kind of expanded from there.
[00:32:56] SPEAKER_02: So from there, we then kind of expanded within Costa Mesa. We opened our DC office not that long after that have been kind of off to the races since then.
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_02: So we're now just about 7,000 employees. We have about 34 or 35 offices around the world depends how you count a little bit of different buildings on the same campus.
[00:33:11] SPEAKER_02: But they're about and are really off to the races scaling, especially on the production side as we land some of these larger contracts and ramping the full scale production and getting out of just the like early R&D type of phase.
[00:33:22] SPEAKER_02: And what are we standing in front of right now?
[00:33:24] SPEAKER_00: We are standing in front of this is our XL UUV in Australia. These are called ghost sharks here in America. They're just called the XL UUV.
[00:33:34] SPEAKER_02: This is a fully robotic submarine. So no humans on board, no people remote controlling fully autonomous.
[00:33:42] SPEAKER_02: So you give it a mission, you program some way points, you program a mission set of what it's supposed to look for where it's supposed to drop payloads when it's supposed to surface.
[00:33:50] SPEAKER_02: And you send it out on its way and it goes and performs its mission completely autonomously. So these are designed at our office in Sydney, Australia, which I had the pleasure of setting up a couple of years ago and we first watched this program.
[00:34:03] SPEAKER_02: And now they are currently being manufactured in our our Sydney manufacturing facility that just opened. It's about 75,000 square feet and is capable of making dozens of these a year.
[00:34:13] SPEAKER_02: And they'll be expanding production for them to our new facility in Quonset, Rhode Island, where we'll be baking both our dive LDs, our smaller submarines and these big guys for the US market.
[00:34:23] SPEAKER_02: The DevTest area here is an area that is meant to break things. It's the blunt version of it. So these guys work on figuring out all sorts of ways to break our products.
[00:34:35] SPEAKER_02: So whether that's spraying it with saltwater as in the case of our little chamber over here, I don't know how much you've spent time on boats, but saltwater eats everything, everything eats water, it eats cables, it eats metal, it eats plastic, it eats leather, it eats, eats rubber, eats everything.
[00:34:51] SPEAKER_02: So when our products get deployed either on coastal environments or on boats or in the water, in case of submarines, you obviously need to work on a lot of that resiliency. So it's one of the test chambers they use for that.
[00:35:03] SPEAKER_02: Drop testing over over voltage, gender voltage, like all sorts of difference part of what we use the end of code chamber for is different kind of resiliency to jamming techniques and all of that.
[00:35:19] SPEAKER_02: In our lab in here we've got test ovens, test chambers. So if you wanted to bake a product, freeze a product, low humidity, high humidity, run it through cycles like that. This is where you do that.
[00:35:30] SPEAKER_02: We have our vibroom over here. So if you wanted to take our product and then shake it and see if connectors come out, see if the different motion kind of causes things to fracture over time.
[00:35:44] SPEAKER_02: Vibetables in here and then in our corner, back over there, you can kind of see, we take a couple steps forward or our battery chargers and dischargers. So if you want to cycle the battery over and over and over again, get up to high charge, low charge, high charge, low charge at different kind of power settings and really kind of drive the batteries to failure, which is obviously important for testing.
[00:36:04] SPEAKER_02: We would do all of that in here. So Menus is a distributed command and control platform. So think of it kind of like having smart compute. So if you want to have AI sensors in the field, you want to have the smartest possible sort of platforms for soldiers in the field to interact with, you need to have distributed compute along these lines.
[00:36:24] SPEAKER_02: So we have very mobile versions of them here on these chassis. And then we have slightly less mobile versions of them in that sort of frame. That is what's called our menace will come around over this side.
[00:36:36] SPEAKER_02: And then there's a variant of all of these that's a on a larger platform that's called Titan. We're partnered with Palantir on the Titan program for bringing their software onto our kind of hardware for this joint program with the Army.
[00:36:49] SPEAKER_02: So, yep. So here on the on the menace platform got all sorts of antennas and communication protocols around built in big compute nodes in the back. You can kind of hear the here the fans humming there.
[00:37:02] SPEAKER_02: And then the whole idea is that there are soldiers would be deployed out and then that gives you a lattice node and lattice compute wherever you are in the world.
[00:37:11] SPEAKER_02: And then this also filters into the broader landscape of having soldier born compute. So like the whole notion of the the I've asked program that we acquired from Microsoft spin out now called what they called it now, SBMC soldier born something something.
[00:37:29] SPEAKER_02: They changed the acronyms every year to keep it so much. But that program is basically like could you put a lattice node on deployed soldiers, so whether that's a wrist mounted head mounted glasses mounted kind of AR type system and that's of course, either way.
[00:37:45] SPEAKER_02: Yeah. So all of this ties together into that distributed ecosystem where compute, comm security, all forward deployed with the soldiers. So it's.
[00:37:55] SPEAKER_00: So fear. It's not a matter of my favorite, but this one this one's pretty fun too. So you want to drive off road a little you just want to take you know, is there a little.
[00:38:04] There's no fortunately drive. You can drive right up here right up through the through the lobby. And I can just bring it right around here, part where everyone.
[00:38:14] In the middle of the road, you don't trust me.
[00:38:18] You just did the same drive.
[00:38:20] SPEAKER_02: Sec wore headsets.
[00:38:22] I mean, I don't want to get into political hot water here, but he jumped the curb and drove it into the into the crowd for the speech.
