[00:00:00] **Elad Gil**: Sometimes founders ask me, what's the biggest way to create a good culture?
[00:00:04] **Elad Gil**: Welcome to Facebook.
[00:00:04] **Elad Gil**: I mean, Esther is winning.
[00:00:06] **Elad Gil**: I remember when people said that SaaS was stupid and cloud was stupid because
[00:00:10] **Elad Gil**: why would an enterprise ever move their data to a third party cloud that wasn't secure?
[00:00:13] **Elad Gil**: I helped get this other company up and running called Branco.
[00:00:16] **Elad Gil**: We were just calling it Branco.
[00:00:17] **Elad Gil**: It was an internal placeholder and then we're going to come up with something better
[00:00:20] **Elad Gil**: and like Apple and like Stripe and a few other companies,
[00:00:22] **Elad Gil**: we just could never come up with anything better.
[00:00:24] **Molly O'Shea**: We should talk about the $30 million series A.
[00:00:26] **Molly O'Shea**: I'm really curious how you shift from investing directly into companies to incubating them.
[00:00:30] **Molly O'Shea**: How did you work through Ivanka's husband?
[00:00:33] **Elad Gil**: Ivanka's husband.
[00:00:36] **Molly O'Shea**: Which Ivanka?
[00:00:38] **Elad Gil**: Jared came out to kind of talk to different people about AI and what was happening.
[00:00:41] **Elad Gil**: We started just kind of comparing notes on what he'd been seeing from the corporate and government world
[00:00:45] **Elad Gil**: in terms of people trying to adopt AI and not really knowing what to do.
[00:00:47] **Elad Gil**: And I'd been talking to a lot of Fortune 100 CEOs and execs about sort of a similar thread
[00:00:52] **Elad Gil**: and so we kind of realized that the world's biggest institutions need to be able
[00:00:55] **Elad Gil**: to have an easy way to adopt AI.
[00:00:56] **Elad Gil**: When I met Jared Kushner, I think the media that portrayed him in a way that was very different from what they're like in person
[00:01:01] **Elad Gil**: in terms of being very smart driven, wanting to do the right thing for the world.
[00:01:04] **Elad Gil**: One thing I've always wanted to do is like imagine that I...
[00:01:07] **Elad Gil**: Well, I actually don't want to talk about this.
[00:01:10] **Elad Gil**: I can tell you after I just don't want to.
[00:01:11] **Molly O'Shea**: Okay.
[00:01:12] **Molly O'Shea**: Off the record, we have an exclusive.
[00:01:14] **Elad Gil**: Yeah, exactly.
[00:01:15] **Elad Gil**: Print it.
[00:01:16] **Molly O'Shea**: With Eric Wu, are you guys going to do anything with Open Door?
[00:01:20] **Elad Gil**: Do you mean like a take private or something?
[00:01:21] **Molly O'Shea**: No, but that would be interesting.
[00:01:25] **Molly O'Shea**: One of the things that when I was doing research, I was listening to previous podcasts you were on
[00:01:37] **Molly O'Shea**: and there was a really good one with Patrick O'Shaughnessy.
[00:01:40] **Molly O'Shea**: And you were talking about markets and how they collapse usually to two to three winners.
[00:01:45] **Molly O'Shea**: So can you explain how that works and like what the framework is around that?
[00:01:49] **Elad Gil**: Oh, I think there's lots of different market structures.
[00:01:52] **Elad Gil**: So there's some things that form natural monopolies, right?
[00:01:55] **Elad Gil**: And so that for a long period of time was like the Microsoft OS or other things like that.
[00:02:00] **Elad Gil**: And then the internet displaced that and a lot of new entrants in the mobile created another entry point.
[00:02:06] **Elad Gil**: So some things actually naturally are just one player really dominates.
[00:02:10] **Elad Gil**: It's kind of like Uber in the US or whatever now.
[00:02:12] **Elad Gil**: There's many markets and this was something I had to learn because I didn't invest in things.
[00:02:17] **Elad Gil**: So like it's not a monopoly that turned out multiple players could win.
[00:02:20] **Elad Gil**: That are actually allegopoly market structures.
[00:02:22] **Elad Gil**: We have a handful of very large players.
[00:02:24] **Elad Gil**: Now sometimes you have these large players and then you have a lot of fragmentation.
[00:02:27] **Elad Gil**: You know, the three big players on 50% of the market and everything's fragmented.
[00:02:29] **Elad Gil**: And that tradition has been payroll, ADP paychecks and then a bunch of stuff.
[00:02:34] **Elad Gil**: And then hopefully now rippling and other sort of gusto and related companies.
[00:02:38] **Elad Gil**: And then I guess deal is another one.
[00:02:41] **Elad Gil**: And then there's
[00:02:44] **Elad Gil**: markets where things are just default fragmented.
[00:02:46] **Elad Gil**: It's like the restaurant business, right?
[00:02:48] **Elad Gil**: There's thousands of restaurants in San Francisco.
[00:02:52] **Elad Gil**: And so depending on different aspects of the market structure,
[00:02:58] **Elad Gil**: what sort of customers you have,
[00:03:00] **Elad Gil**: how dependent are they on your product or their network of facts or their scale effects, etc.
[00:03:04] **Elad Gil**: That drives which market structure you end up with.
[00:03:08] **Elad Gil**: So I think there's lots of different ones in tech and consumer tech,
[00:03:12] **Elad Gil**: the monopoly markets were more common.
[00:03:16] **Elad Gil**: That was Google to some extent and search.
[00:03:18] **Elad Gil**: That was Microsoft with the SoS, etc.
[00:03:20] **Elad Gil**: And then in many, many other markets,
[00:03:22] **Elad Gil**: it's more a non-aligopoly structure.
[00:03:24] **Elad Gil**: Payments is a good example.
[00:03:26] **Elad Gil**: There's a ad gen and there's Stripe and there's PayPal.
[00:03:28] **Elad Gil**: There's a variety of players.
[00:03:30] **Molly O'Shea**: Do you think moats change over time?
[00:03:32] **Elad Gil**: I think that for some companies,
[00:03:34] **Elad Gil**: they build new moats over time for sure.
[00:03:36] **Elad Gil**: I think there's a handful of ways to have them out.
[00:03:38] **Elad Gil**: And I think there are things,
[00:03:40] **Elad Gil**: things just tend to collapse and that he says the things usually I find.
[00:03:42] **Elad Gil**: It's kind of the opposite of there's no good generic startup advice,
[00:03:46] **Elad Gil**: kind of thing, but the reality is there are patterns too.
[00:03:48] **Elad Gil**: And so one mode is a scale effect.
[00:03:52] **Elad Gil**: So for example,
[00:03:54] **Elad Gil**: if you're a payments company,
[00:03:56] **Elad Gil**: the more scale you have,
[00:03:58] **Elad Gil**: the cheaper your interchange fee is on the back end,
[00:04:00] **Elad Gil**: which means you can charge less,
[00:04:02] **Elad Gil**: which means you can get more scale.
[00:04:04] **Elad Gil**: And so you have the cycle.
[00:04:06] **Elad Gil**: That'd be one example of a scale effect.
[00:04:08] **Elad Gil**: For example,
[00:04:10] **Elad Gil**: everybody's built an app on top of Salesforce.
[00:04:12] **Elad Gil**: Everybody selling those apps are integrated in a deep way.
[00:04:14] **Elad Gil**: That helps create defensibility
[00:04:16] **Elad Gil**: because if you're trying to build a Salesforce competitor,
[00:04:18] **Elad Gil**: you may also have to build all these apps at once.
[00:04:20] **Elad Gil**: So you have more to build against and it's tougher.
[00:04:22] **Elad Gil**: So there's these ecosystem or platform effects.
[00:04:26] **Elad Gil**: Some businesses have long-term contracts.
[00:04:30] **Elad Gil**: So for example,
[00:04:32] **Elad Gil**: in the medical distribution world,
[00:04:34] **Elad Gil**: McKesson and that sort of world,
[00:04:36] **Elad Gil**: in the medical distribution,
[00:04:38] **Elad Gil**: people end up in these like three to seven year contracts.
[00:04:40] **Elad Gil**: So the entire industry is effectively locked up
[00:04:42] **Elad Gil**: between a handful of players
[00:04:44] **Elad Gil**: because they each own a chunk of it.
[00:04:46] **Elad Gil**: So there's a lot of different types of,
[00:04:48] **Elad Gil**: I mean, I'm not going to keep going because
[00:04:50] **Elad Gil**: there's like listing all my companies alphabetically, right?
[00:04:52] **Elad Gil**: But fundamentally, there's only a handful of ways to do this
[00:04:54] **Elad Gil**: and they tend to be very consistent,
[00:04:56] **Elad Gil**: but they tend to be very strong network effects as another one.
[00:04:58] **Molly O'Shea**: Shifting into one of your other strategies,
[00:05:00] **Molly O'Shea**: we covered investing macro and everything like that.
[00:05:04] **Molly O'Shea**: But I'm really curious how you
[00:05:06] **Molly O'Shea**: shift from investing directly into companies
[00:05:08] **Molly O'Shea**: to incubating them.
[00:05:10] **Molly O'Shea**: There's a couple companies that you started
[00:05:12] **Molly O'Shea**: that start with Brain.
[00:05:14] **Molly O'Shea**: So what's the deal with these Brain companies?
[00:05:16] **Elad Gil**: I mean, so Anker came up,
[00:05:18] **Elad Gil**: Anker Goyle, who's the CEO and founder
[00:05:20] **Elad Gil**: of Brain Trust,
[00:05:22] **Elad Gil**: came up with Brain Trust,
[00:05:24] **Elad Gil**: which I thought was a great name.
[00:05:26] **Elad Gil**: And I helped him really early get that up and running
[00:05:28] **Elad Gil**: and did a lot of really customer calls.
[00:05:30] **Elad Gil**: And initially we talked about just doing that as like an open source project
[00:05:32] **Elad Gil**: and all the stuff and then it kind of converted into a company.
[00:05:34] **Elad Gil**: So we were just doing it for fun.
[00:05:36] **Elad Gil**: It's like a kind of a side project.
[00:05:40] **Elad Gil**: And then when I helped get this other company up and running called Brain co,
[00:05:44] **Elad Gil**: we were just calling it Brain co as a placeholder.
[00:05:46] **Elad Gil**: Yeah, it wasn't meant to be the long-term name.
[00:05:48] **Elad Gil**: And hopefully Anker isn't upset.
[00:05:50] **Elad Gil**: You know that we have another brain thing in the family.
[00:05:52] **Elad Gil**: But it was meant to be like kind of funny and quirky.
[00:05:56] **Elad Gil**: And it was an internal placeholder.
[00:05:58] **Elad Gil**: And then we're going to come up with something better.
[00:06:00] **Elad Gil**: And like Stripe.
[00:06:01] **Elad Gil**: And if you're other companies, we just could never come up with anything better
[00:06:03] **Elad Gil**: and the people who are working on it liked it.
[00:06:04] **Elad Gil**: So it kind of stuck.
[00:06:05] **Elad Gil**: So it was an inadvertent.
[00:06:06] **Molly O'Shea**: How did you recruit Ivanka's husband?
[00:06:10] **Elad Gil**: Ivanka's husband.
[00:06:12] **Molly O'Shea**: Which Ivanka?
[00:06:14] **Elad Gil**: Ivanka truly?
[00:06:16] **Molly O'Shea**: Oh yeah.
[00:06:17] **Elad Gil**: So I met Jared when he was...
[00:06:22] **Elad Gil**: So Jared came out to kind of talk to different people about AI and what was happening.
[00:06:26] **Elad Gil**: And we started just kind of comparing notes on what he'd been seeing from this sort of corporate
[00:06:33] **Elad Gil**: and government world in terms of people trying to adopt AI and not really knowing what to do.
[00:06:36] **Elad Gil**: And I'd been talking to a lot of Fortune 100 CEOs and execs about sort of a similar thread.
[00:06:45] **Elad Gil**: And there was Luis who works with Jared, who was similarly was having this sort of conversations.
[00:06:48] **Elad Gil**: And so we kind of realized that there was a very clear need and pain point around very large scale enterprise.
[00:06:56] **Elad Gil**: Government, like the world's biggest institutions need to be able to have a easy way to adopt AI for various workflows and purposes.
[00:07:02] **Elad Gil**: And so we thought it would make a lot of sense to kind of build out a company that could have a core platform
[00:07:10] **Elad Gil**: that you could then build different applications on the top of that would serve those needs.
[00:07:13] **Elad Gil**: And so Eric Wu came in as sort of a founder and chairman.
[00:07:16] **Elad Gil**: And then Dan Ashton who you know and Mersha and others came on as sort of the initial founding team.
[00:07:22] **Elad Gil**: And we kind of just were off into the races from then and Clemens recently joined the CEO of the company.
[00:07:27] **Molly O'Shea**: So how do you think about I think this company is really interesting because you're going after one end of the market that has been underserved so far.
[00:07:36] **Molly O'Shea**: Like we're seeing a lot of value accretion in the hardware layer and then now in the LLM.
[00:07:42] **Molly O'Shea**: But like the services really has not been tapped into yet because it's just a downstream effect, I think.
[00:07:48] **Molly O'Shea**: If downstream is the right word, but I'm curious from your standpoint, like how large is this opportunity?
[00:07:53] **Molly O'Shea**: You talked about Tams before, but like how large is this and who are they going to be like.
[00:07:59] **Elad Gil**: Yeah, I mean, I think this is a truly massive, massive town.
[00:08:03] **Elad Gil**: And so, you know, it really is, if you look at a startup's life cycle normally that's doing B2B.
[00:08:10] **Elad Gil**: You tend to start off with smaller businesses you're selling to and then you realize that's a tough market and you go mid market and you spend a couple years in mid market.
[00:08:16] **Elad Gil**: And then eventually do big enterprise and you land your first multi-million dollar deal in your ecstatic or you have a $10 million deal.
[00:08:22] **Elad Gil**: It takes you like three to seven years to get there.
[00:08:26] **Elad Gil**: Is there a thing you let's just jump straight to those customers.
[00:08:29] **Elad Gil**: We have access to them.
[00:08:30] **Elad Gil**: We know their needs.
[00:08:32] **Elad Gil**: We can build really aggressively against it.
[00:08:35] **Elad Gil**: But we can also attract a caliber of engineer to work with them that they just won't necessarily have access to in any other way.
[00:08:41] **Elad Gil**: And that's because we have created a team or brought on a team or hired a team that are the types of people that normally be working at the foundation labs, right.
[00:08:51] **Elad Gil**: They'd be working at OpenAI or they'd be working at Google or they'd be working at some of these great companies.
[00:08:55] **Elad Gil**: And we've really taken the approach of saying we're both going to build out this platform.
[00:09:00] **Elad Gil**: So it's a common piece of infrastructure that everybody can use.
[00:09:03] **Elad Gil**: But then on top of that, we can build the spoke apps and then resell those apps to other people in the same vertical.
[00:09:08] **Elad Gil**: And so if you're dealing with one of the world's biggest healthcare chains, you can repeatedly provide that to the world's biggest healthcare organizations because they all have some similar needs.
[00:09:16] **Elad Gil**: And so we think that strategy has actually worked really well on this enormous pent up demand because every CEO is asking, what is my AI approach with my AI strategy.
[00:09:24] **Elad Gil**: I know it can impact my margin or my productivity or my sales output, you know, maybe I can double sales through it.
[00:09:30] **Elad Gil**: But they may not necessarily have the resources to go right at it immediately or they'll have a research team internally.
[00:09:36] **Elad Gil**: This working on it, but that team can use extra resources or they can use some of the product work that we provide.
[00:09:42] **Molly O'Shea**: Sorcery is brought to you by Brex, the financial stack trusted by more than 30,000 companies, including one in three venture back startups in the US.

[00:10:44] **Molly O'Shea**: Do you think that the MIT study was correct?
[00:10:50] **Elad Gil**: I think it had aspects that were correct.
[00:10:55] **Elad Gil**: So basically the study you're referring to is the one that says that AI doesn't really help anything or whatever.
[00:10:59] **Molly O'Shea**: Yeah, it said 95% of AI pilots are garbage.
[00:11:03] **Molly O'Shea**: But if you read it, it says 63% of ones that were internally created were actually successful.
[00:11:11] **Elad Gil**: Yeah. I don't know how much I believe that kind of data.
[00:11:16] **Elad Gil**: I think it depends on what they mean by pilots and garbage and what does it mean?
[00:11:21] **Elad Gil**: And a lot of people mess around with things and try it the first time.
[00:11:25] **Elad Gil**: And so often the AI adoptions that go to big enterprises, you have a small team is doing almost like skunk works or research.
[00:11:30] **Elad Gil**: Some may become the AI team.
[00:11:32] **Elad Gil**: And they go and they try some stuff and they prototype it and they mess around with it.
[00:11:35] **Elad Gil**: And they're just learning how to use it.
[00:11:36] **Elad Gil**: It's a new technology and it takes time to learn how to use it.
[00:11:39] **Elad Gil**: And then usually there's three places you can implement it as an enterprise.
[00:11:43] **Elad Gil**: You can buy something from a vendor.
[00:11:45] **Elad Gil**: So you're like, I'm going to buy a decagon for customer support or I'm going to buy a bridge for medical scrubbing or whatever it may be.
[00:11:52] **Elad Gil**: And so then there's your vendor selection process and you work with and all this stuff.
[00:11:55] **Elad Gil**: Harvey for legal would be an example of that.
[00:11:58] **Elad Gil**: There's a second set of things that you do, which is internal tooling.
[00:12:03] **Elad Gil**: How do I make my internal teams dramatically more effective?
[00:12:06] **Elad Gil**: How do I build apps for them internally to do things?
[00:12:09] **Elad Gil**: My ops team is doing this repetitive work and use AI for that workflow.
[00:12:13] **Elad Gil**: And then there's stuff that gets it into your own product that you're offering externally to your customers.
[00:12:17] **Elad Gil**: This is sort of the three levels of AI for an enterprise.
[00:12:21] **Elad Gil**: And so when I see a study like that, I'm like, okay, which of these things are they doing?
[00:12:24] **Elad Gil**: And did they try and who is actually working on it?
[00:12:26] **Elad Gil**: And is it the right talent and all the stuff?
[00:12:28] **Elad Gil**: And the reality is if you look at mobile as an example, when mobile first came out,
[00:12:33] **Elad Gil**: everybody said the exact same thing or the internet, right?
[00:12:35] **Elad Gil**: The internet was this giant transformative wave.
[00:12:38] **Elad Gil**: People forget that some companies literally spun out.
[00:12:41] **Elad Gil**: Their internet division is a tracking stock because it would trade so highly
[00:12:45] **Elad Gil**: they could pull in a billion dollars through an IPO of some random piece of whatever business they had.
[00:12:50] **Elad Gil**: And then when those stocks collapsed a few years later as a dot com bubble collapse,
[00:12:53] **Elad Gil**: they rolled them back in super cheap.
[00:12:55] **Elad Gil**: And so it's just a way to are getting some money by branding something as an internet company.
[00:13:02] **Elad Gil**: Again, I think the 90s is a very interesting lesson for today in terms of what we're becoming.
[00:13:06] **Elad Gil**: So if you look at the early mobile wave as an example,
[00:13:10] **Elad Gil**: the first BFA like mobile website was really bad, right?
[00:13:14] **Elad Gil**: You go to this jinky kind of HTML site that was on your phone on your browser
[00:13:18] **Elad Gil**: and you couldn't really do anything and it would crash half the time.
[00:13:21] **Elad Gil**: And then 10 years later you can do these amazing things in the app, right?
[00:13:24] **Elad Gil**: You can scan checks in OCR them.
[00:13:26] **Elad Gil**: You can take out money by tapping it against the ETM in case anybody ever uses cash
[00:13:32] **Elad Gil**: for whatever in affairs things people do.
[00:13:34] **Elad Gil**: Or if you just came up that or you know,
[00:13:37] **Elad Gil**: you can send money really easily with Zell or Venmo or other things.
[00:13:40] **Elad Gil**: And so something that be available up is really useful, right?
[00:13:45] **Elad Gil**: But it took a decade.
[00:13:46] **Elad Gil**: And it just takes time to adopt these things to learn new patterns of usage
[00:13:50] **Elad Gil**: to understand how to use it properly for users to adapt themselves to it.
[00:13:54] **Elad Gil**: So I just think it's going to be one of these long arcs
[00:13:56] **Elad Gil**: and to say that things should immediately be working.
[00:13:58] **Elad Gil**: It's not reflective of any technology wave has ever happened.
[00:14:01] **Elad Gil**: And in the internet people said the internet doesn't matter.
[00:14:03] **Elad Gil**: And in the early crypto days people said crypto doesn't matter.
[00:14:05] **Elad Gil**: And people always say these things don't matter.
[00:14:07] **Elad Gil**: Oh, I remember when people said that SaaS was stupid and cloud was stupid
[00:14:11] **Elad Gil**: because why would an enterprise ever move their data to a third party cloud
[00:14:14] **Elad Gil**: that wasn't secure and you know, it's always the same thing.
[00:14:17] **Elad Gil**: So I just view it as like there's that old saying of old wine and new bottles.
[00:14:22] **Elad Gil**: And I think that's what this is.
[00:14:24] **Elad Gil**: Old wine and new bottles.
[00:14:26] **Molly O'Shea**: How do you think about, and I'm sure you've talked to like many Fortune 500 CEOs teams about this,
[00:14:33] **Molly O'Shea**: how do you think about how different companies are approaching AI
[00:14:36] **Molly O'Shea**: and which ones are doing it right?
[00:14:38] **Molly O'Shea**: Like what are they looking to do?
[00:14:40] **Molly O'Shea**: What are the key components of that?
[00:14:42] **Molly O'Shea**: And then how do you decipher, how do you know like which teams are just not going to make it
[00:14:47] **Molly O'Shea**: because they're just not thinking about it correctly?
[00:14:49] **Elad Gil**: Yeah, I mean, I think these things are tenure journeys, right?
[00:14:52] **Elad Gil**: So the migration of the cloud has taken 15 years for many companies.
[00:14:57] **Elad Gil**: Some companies are still using cobalt and very old programming languages for the services they run, right?
[00:15:02] **Elad Gil**: You'll literally find a cobalt installation running some core server for a company
[00:15:05] **Elad Gil**: doing payment processing or whatever and it hasn't been touched in 40 years, right?
[00:15:10] **Elad Gil**: So I think people misunderstand the state of software and sophistication
[00:15:16] **Elad Gil**: and they're maybe very sophisticated. They miss how these old legacy things.
[00:15:19] **Elad Gil**: And so it's kind of hard to say, hey, we're just going to grade somebody on something, right?
[00:15:23] **Elad Gil**: There's all these other things moving pieces, how they deal with data, you know,
[00:15:27] **Elad Gil**: the whole migration to a data bricks would be an example of something that some companies are still doing, right?
[00:15:30] **Elad Gil**: To get to data lakes and modern data infrastructure.
[00:15:34] **Elad Gil**: So it's a very uneven world around these things.
[00:15:38] **Elad Gil**: And so often what you need to look for is early adopters.
[00:15:41] **Elad Gil**: And then you can work with them to really help implement something that's very useful for them.
[00:15:45] **Elad Gil**: Or to build on top of this platform that is an example.
[00:15:48] **Elad Gil**: Brinko has the thing I found striking, having worked in different businesses for a long time,
[00:15:52] **Elad Gil**: is in every industry, there's a set of early adopters.
[00:15:56] **Elad Gil**: And they're trying to be the key influencers or decision leaders or opinion leaders in that area.
[00:16:02] **Elad Gil**: So for example, if you're selling HR software, I think it's Costco and Home Depot.
[00:16:06] **Elad Gil**: And if you others are graded adopting new benefits, new HR software, et cetera, which you wouldn't expect, right?
[00:16:12] **Elad Gil**: These are big, you know, impressive enterprises.
[00:16:15] **Elad Gil**: But they often adopt things before younger companies, well, or smaller companies, well.
[00:16:19] **Elad Gil**: And so often what you ask yourself for any new product is who are the taste makers,
[00:16:23] **Elad Gil**: or who are the people who are in general tend to adopt things more.
[00:16:26] **Elad Gil**: And can I work with them first because they'll be fastest, they'll be easiest, they'll be with the most thoughtful,
[00:16:30] **Elad Gil**: they'll give good feedback.
[00:16:31] **Elad Gil**: But they'll also spread it to other people because other HR departments call them for advice and view them as sort of a leader.
[00:16:39] **Molly O'Shea**: We should talk about the $30 million series A. How did that come together?
[00:16:43] **Elad Gil**: Yeah, I think what we decided to do was there's almost two ways you see people incubate things.
[00:16:49] **Elad Gil**: One is they take a lot of common stock and they try to control the company and they try to...
[00:16:54] **Elad Gil**: And we did the opposite where we said, well, just put money into buyer ownership stakes.
[00:16:58] **Elad Gil**: And you know, the equity should really go to the employees and the founders and the people running it day to day.
[00:17:03] **Elad Gil**: So we kind of approached it as a more traditional financing structure.
[00:17:06] **Molly O'Shea**: And who was involved?
[00:17:08] **Elad Gil**: Yeah, I mean, we had a great group.
[00:17:10] **Elad Gil**: So I, my fund and Jerry's, which is Affinity, Coletta, so we just put in half.
[00:17:19] **Elad Gil**: And then we had a great sort of bevy of angels across AI, you know...
[00:17:25] **Molly O'Shea**: Very reasonable.
[00:17:26] **Molly O'Shea**: I have them.
[00:17:27] **Elad Gil**: Yeah, that would be amazing.
[00:17:28] **Molly O'Shea**: It's a better clip from you.
[00:17:29] **Molly O'Shea**: I was trying to tee you up for this.
[00:17:31] **Elad Gil**: Yeah, please.
[00:17:32] **Molly O'Shea**: Where?
[00:17:33] **Elad Gil**: Oh, here it is.
[00:17:34] **Elad Gil**: I'm memorizing alphabetical order.
[00:17:36] **Elad Gil**: This is going to take a while.
[00:17:38] **Molly O'Shea**: Yeah.
[00:17:39] **Elad Gil**: It's going to be hard for me to pronounce all their names.
[00:17:41] **Elad Gil**: We have the CEO of Databricks.
[00:17:43] **Elad Gil**: We have Andre Carpathi.
[00:17:44] **Elad Gil**: We have former chairman and CEO of Dow Chemical.
[00:17:47] **Elad Gil**: We have the CEO of Proplexity, CEO of Coinbase, CEO of Applications at OpenAI,
[00:17:52] **Elad Gil**: Chief Product Officer at OpenAI, former chairman and CEO of EY.
[00:17:56] **Elad Gil**: Global co-head of Blackstone Real Estate, founder of Angelus.
[00:18:01] **Molly O'Shea**: That's an evolved.
[00:18:02] **Elad Gil**: Yeah, evolved great.
[00:18:03] **Molly O'Shea**: You didn't know.
[00:18:04] **Elad Gil**: Yeah, evolved.
[00:18:05] **Elad Gil**: It's so good.
[00:18:06] **Elad Gil**: Nome Brown, AI Researcher at OpenAI.
[00:18:09] **Elad Gil**: We have Patrick Callison, CEO of Stripe.
[00:18:11] **Elad Gil**: Reid Hoffman.
[00:18:13] **Elad Gil**: We have Sarah Gua, is that how you pronounce it?
[00:18:15] **Molly O'Shea**: I think so.
[00:18:16] **Elad Gil**: I think it's Gua.
[00:18:17] **Elad Gil**: Well, I've been listening to like a lot of different things,
[00:18:20] **Elad Gil**: pronunciation, pronunciations.
[00:18:21] **Molly O'Shea**: We should ask her.
[00:18:22] **Elad Gil**: She's a comedian.
[00:18:23] **Molly O'Shea**: Yeah, she's a caller.
[00:18:24] **Elad Gil**: Sarah Gua.
[00:18:25] **Molly O'Shea**: Yeah.
[00:18:26] **Elad Gil**: And then we also have the CEO of Together AI.
[00:18:30] **Molly O'Shea**: How do you get all of these people on one cap table?
[00:18:33] **Elad Gil**: Well, I mean, I think a number of people helped really pull this round together.
[00:18:36] **Elad Gil**: Eric was very involved.
[00:18:37] **Elad Gil**: Jared was involved.
[00:18:38] **Elad Gil**: Dan, the president of the company, you know, really drove the fundraise day to day.
[00:18:43] **Elad Gil**: So I think it's one of those things where people were just very excited about what we were
[00:18:47] **Elad Gil**: doing.
[00:18:48] **Elad Gil**: It was one of those moments where everybody talked to us like,
[00:18:50] **Elad Gil**: of course, this is needed.
[00:18:51] **Elad Gil**: Of course, I've seen use cases.
[00:18:52] **Elad Gil**: Of course, I've seen people ask me about this.
[00:18:54] **Elad Gil**: So I just think it's one of those things where we thought it was a clear indicator
[00:18:58] **Elad Gil**: of just like how interesting and exciting what we're doing is.
[00:19:01] **Elad Gil**: And then as people met, Dan and Clemens and the team, I would get texts where they're
[00:19:06] **Elad Gil**: like, oh, my God, these are really impressive people, right?
[00:19:09] **Elad Gil**: Like, I want to, I want to back whatever these people do.
[00:19:12] **Elad Gil**: So I think it's also the caliber of the people involved operating the company really matters.
[00:19:17] **Molly O'Shea**: And with Eric Wu, are you guys going to do anything with Open Door?
[00:19:22] **Elad Gil**: Oh, you mean like a take private or something?
[00:19:25] **Molly O'Shea**: I mean, no, but that was interesting.
[00:19:28] **Molly O'Shea**: I know that question was leading.
[00:19:30] **Elad Gil**: Maybe they'll be a customer.
[00:19:31] **Molly O'Shea**: Yeah, they're going to be open door and help fill in that market cap that they just
[00:19:37] **Molly O'Shea**: got.
[00:19:38] **Elad Gil**: Eric is awesome.
[00:19:39] **Elad Gil**: He's so good.
[00:19:40] **Elad Gil**: It's one of those things where he's so impressive in terms of how good he is at operating
[00:19:44] **Elad Gil**: things and getting things done.
[00:19:46] **Elad Gil**: And thinking about things strategically, like, you know, I backed his very first company
[00:19:50] **Elad Gil**: Movedie like years ago.
[00:19:52] **Elad Gil**: And then I backed Open Door.
[00:19:54] **Elad Gil**: And I've worked with him over the years.
[00:19:56] **Elad Gil**: And then I started working with him on on Branco.
[00:19:59] **Elad Gil**: And I was just so impressed.
[00:20:00] **Elad Gil**: I already knew him and I already knew he was very good, but he's really taking things
[00:20:04] **Elad Gil**: at the next level.
[00:20:05] **Molly O'Shea**: In today's high speed business world, staying ahead means using the smartest tools possible,

[00:20:41] **Molly O'Shea**: Between all of your investments and the companies that you've funded,
[00:20:45] **Molly O'Shea**: what is the best redemption story that you've seen?
[00:20:47] **Elad Gil**: A redemption story.
[00:20:48] **Elad Gil**: How do you define redemption?
[00:20:50] **Molly O'Shea**: Coming back from the ashes.
[00:20:51] **Elad Gil**: Oh, I mean, I think there's a couple examples of that.
[00:20:54] **Elad Gil**: What's meant by the ashes, right?
[00:20:56] **Elad Gil**: There's a few founders that I've backed where there are some bumps along the way
[00:21:05] **Elad Gil**: with their first company in one form or another, even if the company was successful.
[00:21:08] **Elad Gil**: An example would be Parker Conrad from Rippling.
[00:21:12] **Elad Gil**: I backed him at Zenefitz.
[00:21:13] **Elad Gil**: I was an angel in that company, and then I invested in the first round of Rippling.
[00:21:16] **Elad Gil**: That was a good example where there was obviously controversy around the company.
[00:21:22] **Elad Gil**: I always thought he was amazing.
[00:21:23] **Elad Gil**: I always thought he would have some amazing redemption arc,
[00:21:26] **Elad Gil**: and so I got involved with Rippling in the very first round
[00:21:28] **Elad Gil**: as sort of a vote of confidence behind him in what he was doing.
[00:21:31] **Elad Gil**: Palmer Lucky is another one where I backed Andrew in the very first round,
[00:21:35] **Elad Gil**: and he was controversial given what happened at Metta early on with him.
[00:21:39] **Elad Gil**: I think in both cases they basically got thrown into the bus in one form or another.
[00:21:43] **Elad Gil**: So I think they deserved that arc.
[00:21:47] **Elad Gil**: So I think they've done amazing things.
[00:21:49] **Elad Gil**: I mean, when I met Jared Kushner, I think similarly,
[00:21:52] **Elad Gil**: the media had portrayed him in a way that was him and Ivanka,
[00:21:55] **Elad Gil**: both actually in a way that was very different from what they're like in person
[00:21:58] **Elad Gil**: in terms of being very smart driven,
[00:22:00] **Elad Gil**: wanting to do the right thing for the world.
[00:22:03] **Elad Gil**: So at this point, I think I've worked with lots of people
[00:22:05] **Elad Gil**: who in one form or another at one time or another had gone a little bit through some firestorm
[00:22:11] **Elad Gil**: and came out the other side stronger and more motivated and crisp on what they care about
[00:22:18] **Elad Gil**: and what's important in life.
[00:22:20] **Elad Gil**: You know, because I think experience is like that for many people.
[00:22:23] **Elad Gil**: And I'm not saying anything specific to any of these individuals.
[00:22:26] **Elad Gil**: I've just observed in general that sometimes a controversy also just makes you crisper about what's important to you,
[00:22:33] **Elad Gil**: like as a person.
[00:22:34] **Molly O'Shea**: Most of those do run through the media cycles
[00:22:37] **Molly O'Shea**: and the harsh reality of what can happen to you in the news.
[00:22:42] **Molly O'Shea**: I'm curious from your standpoint,
[00:22:44] **Molly O'Shea**: you have podcasts, you put out a book, you're like close to all these worlds,
[00:22:48] **Molly O'Shea**: these personal stories.
[00:22:50] **Molly O'Shea**: What do you think people most get wrong about headlines versus reality?
[00:22:54] **Elad Gil**: Oh, I mean, for certain media, the headline is literally the opposite of reality.
[00:22:59] **Elad Gil**: And we've seen that a lot throughout COVID and some of the claims that were made
[00:23:03] **Elad Gil**: and then reversed a year or two later.
[00:23:05] **Elad Gil**: I mean, literally reversed.
[00:23:06] **Elad Gil**: It wasn't like, oh, we were slightly wrong.
[00:23:08] **Elad Gil**: It was we were completely wrong, right on so many topics.
[00:23:12] **Elad Gil**: And so I think it's very hard to trust reasonably large swaths of the media.
[00:23:16] **Elad Gil**: And you've probably heard or talked about like the Marie-Gelle Manifact,
[00:23:19] **Elad Gil**: or Jelman, I never know his name, his name.
[00:23:22] **Elad Gil**: Do you know this whole story?
[00:23:23] **Molly O'Shea**: Okay, so Michael Crichton, the author who wrote Jurassic Park and all these things,
[00:23:28] **Elad Gil**: was trying to coin a phrase that would reflect a situation
[00:23:32] **Elad Gil**: where say you're reading the New York Times
[00:23:35] **Elad Gil**: and you read an article about something that you're an expert in.
[00:23:39] **Elad Gil**: You're like, oh, my God, they got all this wrong.
[00:23:41] **Elad Gil**: It's complete bullshit.
[00:23:42] **Elad Gil**: And then you flip the page and you read an article about something
[00:23:45] **Elad Gil**: that you don't know anything about and you believe it, right?
[00:23:48] **Elad Gil**: But you just read something that they wrote that was completely false.
[00:23:50] **Elad Gil**: So he called this the Marie-Gelle Manifact because Marie-Gelle Man was a two-time noble physicist
[00:23:55] **Elad Gil**: and so he's trying to choose the name of somebody really smart and attributed to them
[00:23:59] **Elad Gil**: to make the effects seem more wady or important.
[00:24:01] **Elad Gil**: So it was kind of like a branding exercise, the name and effort of this physicist.
[00:24:04] **Elad Gil**: But I think everybody has that, right?
[00:24:07] **Elad Gil**: You'll read something and be like, oh, I know this and this is obviously false
[00:24:10] **Elad Gil**: and then I'll read the next one and be like, oh, of course this must be true.
[00:24:13] **Elad Gil**: And I think one of the big lessons for me was a lot of the stuff is just false
[00:24:18] **Elad Gil**: and a lot of it is manufactured and there's agendas behind these things.
[00:24:21] **Elad Gil**: I don't think it's an accident over and over and over again.
[00:24:23] **Elad Gil**: I think it's purposeful.
[00:24:25] **Elad Gil**: I think it's really bad for society that people act this way.
[00:24:30] **Elad Gil**: But also, I think it just reinforces and it's interesting.
[00:24:34] **Elad Gil**: A lot of the outcry in either traditional media or online is, oh, well, don't trust that person.
[00:24:40] **Elad Gil**: They're not an expert. They haven't, you know, they're looking at the data directly.
[00:24:43] **Elad Gil**: But what did they know? And you're like, well, actually, that's the best way to actually understand things.
[00:24:46] **Elad Gil**: And so I remember early on in COVID, in late January, early February of 2020,
[00:24:53] **Elad Gil**: I actually sent out an email to founder saying, hey, I think this COVID thing is real
[00:24:56] **Elad Gil**: and it's going to be really bad and they may shut down cities and all the stuff, right?
[00:25:00] **Elad Gil**: Because you saw them weld people into their apartments in Wuhan, right?
[00:25:03] **Molly O'Shea**: Yeah, which doesn't happen.
[00:25:05] **Elad Gil**: It was kind of an out of thing every day.
[00:25:07] **Molly O'Shea**: Yeah, you kind of notice it if you're paying attention.
[00:25:10] **Elad Gil**: And then a few months later, my chief of staff pulled all the data off of the government websites
[00:25:14] **Elad Gil**: and it was very clear the demographics that were actually impacted by COVID
[00:25:18] **Elad Gil**: and that had very deep policy implications in terms of what you should be doing societally.
[00:25:22] **Elad Gil**: Should you be shutting down schools or not? Probably not actually.
[00:25:25] **Elad Gil**: And so we wrote this up and it got circulated a bunch of governments
[00:25:29] **Elad Gil**: and we got calls from the White House. We got calls from the UK government.
[00:25:32] **Elad Gil**: We actually got a number of phone calls on what we wrote up because it was very data driven.
[00:25:35] **Elad Gil**: It was just like, here's the data.
[00:25:37] **Elad Gil**: And here's some basic implications.
[00:25:39] **Elad Gil**: And then of course policy went in the opposite direction, right?
[00:25:42] **Elad Gil**: But I think it was clear.
[00:25:44] **Elad Gil**: Like what was real, wasn't real quite early.
[00:25:47] **Elad Gil**: So I think you kind of ran into that over and over again.
[00:25:50] **Elad Gil**: And to some extent, if to tie that back to startup investing,
[00:25:53] **Elad Gil**: I think people tend to project a lot of things under the world.
[00:25:58] **Elad Gil**: And there's lots of forms of that.
[00:26:00] **Elad Gil**: As a founder, for example, you project the way that you act on to employees
[00:26:05] **Elad Gil**: if you haven't managed before.
[00:26:07] **Elad Gil**: And founders are perfectly fine with chaos and uncertainty and risk.
[00:26:10] **Elad Gil**: And most people aren't. Most of your employees want a stable direction.
[00:26:14] **Elad Gil**: They want to feel like the thing is working and they want to know where to go.
[00:26:17] **Elad Gil**: But as a founder often early on in your career, you don't provide that
[00:26:19] **Elad Gil**: because you don't realize you're projecting on to people your own viewpoint.
[00:26:22] **Elad Gil**: That happened societally or how do you interpret certain information
[00:26:25] **Elad Gil**: or how do you really see the world in a clear and crisp way?
[00:26:28] **Elad Gil**: And so one of the things I try to do as an investor is ask,
[00:26:30] **Elad Gil**: what is the reality of this thing?
[00:26:31] **Elad Gil**: Not what is the thing?
[00:26:32] **Elad Gil**: I hope it is.
[00:26:33] **Elad Gil**: The thing the founder is telling me that, you know,
[00:26:35] **Elad Gil**: what do I, what is really going to happen here?
[00:26:38] **Elad Gil**: What is the physics of the situation?
[00:26:40] **Elad Gil**: A friend of mine used to work with Steve Jobs.
[00:26:43] **Elad Gil**: And he said that the thing that he felt that Steve Jobs had
[00:26:48] **Elad Gil**: wasn't a reality distortion field.
[00:26:50] **Elad Gil**: You don't change reality.
[00:26:51] **Elad Gil**: Reality is what it is.
[00:26:53] **Elad Gil**: He just was able to see things more crisply
[00:26:56] **Elad Gil**: and articulate them with the fewest number of words in a way
[00:26:59] **Elad Gil**: that would motivate the person to act against that reality.
[00:27:02] **Elad Gil**: So it wasn't reality distortion.
[00:27:04] **Elad Gil**: It was clarity of seeing and clarity of communication.
[00:27:08] **Elad Gil**: And one of the things I found that tends to correlate
[00:27:11] **Elad Gil**: with very good founders is that clarity of thought
[00:27:14] **Elad Gil**: and it's often reflected in crisp communication.
[00:27:18] **Molly O'Shea**: What's the worst advice you've ever received?
[00:27:20] **Elad Gil**: The worst advice I've ever received?
[00:27:22] **Elad Gil**: I mean, I think there's a lot of advice out there
[00:27:25] **Elad Gil**: that I just don't agree with, like, follow what you're passionate about.
[00:27:28] **Molly O'Shea**: Really?
[00:27:29] **Elad Gil**: Yeah.
[00:27:30] **Molly O'Shea**: Why?
[00:27:31] **Elad Gil**: Because most people's passions are really bad dead end things
[00:27:34] **Elad Gil**: to follow, like, realistically, right?
[00:27:36] **Elad Gil**: Do you want to have a good job or not?
[00:27:37] **Elad Gil**: Do you want to have a family?
[00:27:39] **Elad Gil**: Do you want to, you know, et cetera?
[00:27:41] **Elad Gil**: I think, societally, we've been giving really bad advice
[00:27:43] **Elad Gil**: around very basic aspects like that.
[00:27:48] **Elad Gil**: So, you know, one thing I've always wanted to do is,
[00:27:52] **Elad Gil**: like, imagine that I, well, I actually don't want to talk about this.
[00:27:57] **Elad Gil**: I can tell you after I still want to get on there.
[00:28:00] **Molly O'Shea**: Off the record.
[00:28:01] **Molly O'Shea**: We have an exclusive.
[00:28:02] **Elad Gil**: Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:03] **Elad Gil**: Print it.
[00:28:04] **Elad Gil**: Yeah, I think that's one piece of advice that usually isn't good.
[00:28:09] **Elad Gil**: Everyone's while your passion lines up with something really important
[00:28:11] **Elad Gil**: for the world or really important for a field or discipline
[00:28:14] **Elad Gil**: or industry or society and great follow your passion.
[00:28:16] **Elad Gil**: But most of the time, it's really bad advice
[00:28:18] **Elad Gil**: and it actually leads people to a suboptimal state in life.
[00:28:22] **Elad Gil**: I've also find that people, you know, sometimes founders ask me,
[00:28:25] **Elad Gil**: what's the biggest way to create a good culture?
[00:28:28] **Elad Gil**: And the answer is winning.
[00:28:30] **Elad Gil**: That's the best way to create a good culture.
[00:28:31] **Elad Gil**: It's not the motivational speeches and the kombucha or what.
[00:28:34] **Elad Gil**: It's like, when you're winning, everybody's excited
[00:28:36] **Elad Gil**: and they want to show up and they want to do good work.
[00:28:39] **Elad Gil**: And that's true in many aspects of life.
[00:28:41] **Molly O'Shea**: Okay, so sorcery is sponsored by Brex.
[00:28:44] **Molly O'Shea**: One of your really investments, love Brex.
[00:28:47] **Molly O'Shea**: And they're all about spending smarter moving faster.
[00:28:51] **Molly O'Shea**: They are a performance modern intelligence finance platform.
[00:28:55] **Molly O'Shea**: And I'm really curious from your standpoint on how you manage performance
[00:28:59] **Molly O'Shea**: between all of your projects.
[00:29:00] **Molly O'Shea**: You are constantly context switching.
[00:29:03] **Molly O'Shea**: How do you manage that?
[00:29:04] **Elad Gil**: You know, I'd like to get to, well, I think there's lots of different approaches
[00:29:08] **Elad Gil**: that people take to sort of manage context switching.
[00:29:10] **Elad Gil**: Sometimes people block out hours of the day to do certain things.
[00:29:13] **Elad Gil**: You know, Jack Dorsey, when he was running Twitter and Square famously,
[00:29:17] **Elad Gil**: would have chunks of the day for Square and chunks of the day for Twitter.
[00:29:20] **Elad Gil**: Or so he could just show up and be focused.
[00:29:22] **Elad Gil**: So some people take that approach.
[00:29:24] **Elad Gil**: Obviously, if you have a team, there's things you can delegate specifically
[00:29:27] **Elad Gil**: that allow you to sort of multitask things
[00:29:29] **Elad Gil**: or create a distributed environment to getting things done.
[00:29:31] **Elad Gil**: So I think there's lots of things like that.
[00:29:34] **Molly O'Shea**: What do you use?
[00:29:35] **Elad Gil**: It's a mixture of some team leverage.
[00:29:37] **Elad Gil**: And then, you know, I think it's just trying to emphasize
[00:29:45] **Elad Gil**: what are the most important things to get done in a given day or week.
[00:29:50] **Elad Gil**: And so sometimes I'll sit down in the morning and say,
[00:29:52] **Elad Gil**: what do I actually have to do today?
[00:29:53] **Elad Gil**: There's all these things I could do today or I'll get sucked into today.
[00:29:55] **Elad Gil**: But what are the two or three things that if I get them done are actually important?
[00:29:59] **Elad Gil**: And then what's that for the week?
[00:30:00] **Elad Gil**: And I think that's really useful.
[00:30:02] **Elad Gil**: One exercise that I'm about to go through is I'm going to try and think 10 years ahead,
[00:30:07] **Elad Gil**: which is of course silly and stupid and it never actually works.
[00:30:10] **Elad Gil**: But I basically want to think in terms of one, three and 10 years
[00:30:14] **Elad Gil**: and think across force fears and kind of plan against that.
[00:30:18] **Elad Gil**: And so I don't want to wake up 10 years from now and say,
[00:30:20] **Elad Gil**: where did the 10 years go?
[00:30:21] **Elad Gil**: John Lennon has this quote that life is what's happening when you're making other plans.
[00:30:25] **Elad Gil**: Right.
[00:30:26] **Elad Gil**: And so this fears I want to start thinking about are obviously there's personal life
[00:30:31] **Elad Gil**: and kids and family and how do you want to think about that?
[00:30:33] **Elad Gil**: There's society and societal impact.
[00:30:35] **Elad Gil**: That's things like the monuments projects or other things like that.
[00:30:38] **Elad Gil**: Like how do you want to actually make the world or your neighborhood or your society better?
[00:30:42] **Elad Gil**: There's the work side of it.
[00:30:44] **Elad Gil**: You know, like what do you want to impact?
[00:30:46] **Elad Gil**: What do you want to build?
[00:30:47] **Elad Gil**: What sort of institution do you want to leave behind?
[00:30:48] **Elad Gil**: Or what do you want to accomplish?
[00:30:50] **Elad Gil**: And that could be impact goals.
[00:30:54] **Elad Gil**: It could be financial goals.
[00:30:55] **Elad Gil**: It could be right different goals.
[00:30:57] **Elad Gil**: And then the last piece is more like how do you think about relevance in the world
[00:31:01] **Elad Gil**: and society over a longer arc?
[00:31:03] **Elad Gil**: And so I'm kind of thinking across those those four things.
[00:31:06] **Molly O'Shea**: It's a perfect answer.
[00:31:08] **Molly O'Shea**: Thank you, Brex.

[00:31:59] **Elad Gil**: That's great.
[00:32:00] **Molly O'Shea**: Is he in the room with us right now?

[00:32:02] **Elad Gil**: He's with us today.
[00:32:03] **Molly O'Shea**: Okay, so as we close out, I want to go through some quick future predictions.
[00:32:08] **Elad Gil**: Okay.
[00:32:09] **Molly O'Shea**: Okay, first we're going to do some from Calche.
[00:32:11] **Molly O'Shea**: Are you ready for this?
[00:32:12] **Elad Gil**: Yeah.
[00:32:13] **Molly O'Shea**: It'll be fast.
[00:32:14] **Molly O'Shea**: Okay.
[00:32:15] **Molly O'Shea**: When will OpenAI achieve AGI?
[00:32:16] **Elad Gil**: I have no idea.
[00:32:17] **Elad Gil**: Because people always say what's the definition of AGI and what is AGI?
[00:32:20] **Elad Gil**: You know, people always dodge the question that way.
[00:32:22] **Elad Gil**: So it's going to dodge the question.
[00:32:23] **Molly O'Shea**: Thank you.
[00:32:24] **Molly O'Shea**: I know what it means.
[00:32:25] **Molly O'Shea**: Before 2030.
[00:32:26] **Elad Gil**: Before 2020.
[00:32:27] **Elad Gil**: I don't want to buy his Calche.
[00:32:28] **Elad Gil**: I don't want to destroy their marketplace.
[00:32:32] **Elad Gil**: Look, the markets.
[00:32:34] **Elad Gil**: It's up to the markets, free markets.
[00:32:35] **Molly O'Shea**: Yeah.
[00:32:36] **Elad Gil**: Free markets.
[00:32:37] **Molly O'Shea**: Yeah.
[00:32:38] **Molly O'Shea**: Okay.
[00:32:39] **Molly O'Shea**: This one's a little bit more fun.
[00:32:40] **Molly O'Shea**: Will a humanoid robot walk on Mars before a human does?
[00:32:43] **Molly O'Shea**: What do you think the odds are?
[00:32:45] **Elad Gil**: Probably quite high, like 80%.
[00:32:47] **Molly O'Shea**: Really?
[00:32:48] **Molly O'Shea**: Why?
[00:32:49] **Elad Gil**: You can send them any time of year.
[00:32:50] **Elad Gil**: The length of the journey doesn't matter.
[00:32:53] **Elad Gil**: You don't need to worry about life support and other systems being built in.
[00:32:56] **Elad Gil**: That are self-sustainable.
[00:32:57] **Elad Gil**: You don't have to worry about food.
[00:32:58] **Elad Gil**: There's a lot of things you don't have to worry about.
[00:33:01] **Elad Gil**: I mean, we've already sent a robot to Mars.
[00:33:03] **Elad Gil**: Right?
[00:33:04] **Elad Gil**: We have Mars Rovers.
[00:33:05] **Elad Gil**: So we've already accomplished that part.
[00:33:06] **Elad Gil**: So a humanoid version of that seems fine.
[00:33:08] **Elad Gil**: I don't know why we care if it's humanoid.
[00:33:10] **Elad Gil**: But let's do it.
[00:33:12] **Molly O'Shea**: I think they're thinking of Optimus in particular.
[00:33:16] **Elad Gil**: Yeah.
[00:33:17] **Elad Gil**: That probably makes some sense.
[00:33:18] **Molly O'Shea**: Yeah.
[00:33:19] **Molly O'Shea**: Somebody's brain uploaded into it.
[00:33:20] **Molly O'Shea**: I wonder who's brain is going to be?
[00:33:21] **Elad Gil**: Oh my gosh.
[00:33:22] **Molly O'Shea**: Yeah.
[00:33:23] **Molly O'Shea**: It's going to be very exciting.
[00:33:24] **Elad Gil**: That's really interesting.
[00:33:25] **Elad Gil**: Well, it's probably...
[00:33:26] **Elad Gil**: Who do you send?
[00:33:28] **Elad Gil**: X-A-I's brain.
[00:33:29] **Elad Gil**: You probably send X-A-I.
[00:33:30] **Molly O'Shea**: Yeah.
[00:33:31] **Molly O'Shea**: So it's going to be...
[00:33:32] **Molly O'Shea**: Everyone's...
[00:33:33] **Elad Gil**: Yeah, it's going to be making memes from Mars.
[00:33:34] **Elad Gil**: That'll be amazing.
[00:33:35] **Molly O'Shea**: I would be down for that.
[00:33:36] **Molly O'Shea**: I would love memes from Mars.
[00:33:37] **Molly O'Shea**: I would follow that.
[00:33:38] **Molly O'Shea**: On the X.
[00:33:39] **Elad Gil**: Yeah.
[00:33:40] **Molly O'Shea**: How do they make memes from Mars?
[00:33:42] **Elad Gil**: They would just tweet them.
[00:33:43] **Elad Gil**: They're going to post them.
[00:33:44] **Elad Gil**: I'm sorry.
[00:33:45] **Elad Gil**: They're going to say tweets anywhere.
[00:33:46] **Elad Gil**: I used to work at Twitter or so.
[00:33:47] **Elad Gil**: I think I'm allowed to still use OG terms.
[00:33:49] **Elad Gil**: But most people can't.
[00:33:50] **Elad Gil**: I don't know.
[00:33:51] **Elad Gil**: I'm not the...
[00:33:52] **Molly O'Shea**: You get banned.
[00:33:53] **Molly O'Shea**: You get thrown off.
[00:33:54] **Elad Gil**: Yeah.
[00:33:55] **Molly O'Shea**: Well, right now, the odds for this are at 32%.
[00:33:57] **Elad Gil**: Oh, really?
[00:33:58] **Molly O'Shea**: I think there's tremendous upside in this one.
[00:34:01] **Elad Gil**: Yeah, I should actually invest in that one.
[00:34:03] **Elad Gil**: That's good.
[00:34:04] **Molly O'Shea**: On the theme of Outer Space, I really want to get your opinion on this.
[00:34:08] **Molly O'Shea**: First, on what the odds are for this, and then also your opinion on the topic in general.
[00:34:14] **Molly O'Shea**: Are you ready?
[00:34:15] **Elad Gil**: Yeah.
[00:34:16] **Molly O'Shea**: Will the USA that aliens exist this year?
[00:34:18] **Elad Gil**: I think the odds are that are low.
[00:34:20] **Elad Gil**: Just given historical precedent.
[00:34:22] **Molly O'Shea**: Why?
[00:34:23] **Elad Gil**: Well, just given historical precedent.
[00:34:25] **Elad Gil**: There's three scenarios.
[00:34:27] **Elad Gil**: One is aliens exist, and the US government knows about it, and they won't tell us.
[00:34:32] **Elad Gil**: Why would they tell us specifically this year if they've known for a while?
[00:34:36] **Elad Gil**: There's they don't exist.
[00:34:38] **Elad Gil**: In which case, they could tell us, but then they're lying.
[00:34:41] **Elad Gil**: There's a reason to do that.
[00:34:43] **Elad Gil**: Or they don't exist, and they don't tell us.
[00:34:45] **Elad Gil**: And the last one is that they exist, and they don't know.
[00:34:47] **Elad Gil**: And so if they don't know, why would they sell me discover it this year?
[00:34:50] **Molly O'Shea**: Do you think they exist?
[00:34:51] **Elad Gil**: I'm sure there's alien intelligence somewhere in the universe.
[00:34:54] **Elad Gil**: It's a big universe.
[00:34:55] **Molly O'Shea**: I don't know what do you think.
[00:34:56] **Molly O'Shea**: Definitely.
[00:34:57] **Elad Gil**: Yeah.
[00:34:58] **Elad Gil**: Definitely.
[00:34:59] **Molly O'Shea**: Do you think you've met alien life?
[00:35:00] **Elad Gil**: Probably.
[00:35:01] **Molly O'Shea**: Yeah.
[00:35:02] **Molly O'Shea**: I think this goes kind of weird sometimes.
[00:35:03] **Elad Gil**: Yeah.
[00:35:04] **Elad Gil**: I think I like definitely walked across the street with a few this morning.
[00:35:08] **Molly O'Shea**: Mm-hmm.
[00:35:09] **Elad Gil**: Yeah.
[00:35:10] **Molly O'Shea**: It gets a little sketchy, you never know.
[00:35:11] **Elad Gil**: Yeah.
[00:35:12] **Elad Gil**: It's kind of rough.
[00:35:13] **Molly O'Shea**: Yeah.
[00:35:14] **Elad Gil**: That's why I don't walk around us up anymore.
[00:35:16] **Elad Gil**: The alien life.
[00:35:17] **Molly O'Shea**: You don't?
[00:35:18] **Molly O'Shea**: How do you get around?
[00:35:19] **Molly O'Shea**: Waymo?
[00:35:20] **Elad Gil**: I don't.
[00:35:21] **Elad Gil**: I don't really.
[00:35:22] **Molly O'Shea**: Yeah.
[00:35:23] **Molly O'Shea**: I'm not going to do that.
[00:35:24] **Molly O'Shea**: But thank you.
[00:35:25] **Elad Gil**: The biking or the waymo?
[00:35:26] **Elad Gil**: I'm not going to think.
[00:35:27] **Molly O'Shea**: Yeah.
[00:35:28] **Elad Gil**: Smart.
[00:35:29] **Elad Gil**: It affects my podcast outfits.
[00:35:30] **Elad Gil**: It's a good optimization function.
