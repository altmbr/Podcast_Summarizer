[00:00:00] The two smartest people that I've ever worked with closely are Mike Bloomberg and Travis
[00:00:04] SPEAKER_00: County.
[00:00:05] SPEAKER_00: Barnum.
[00:00:06] SPEAKER_00: I'm sitting in a Walmart meeting and a friend of mine called and said, Hey, there's
[00:00:09] SPEAKER_00: a guy with a small transportation start up.
[00:00:11] SPEAKER_00: He's having some regulatory problems with your mind talking to him.
[00:00:14] SPEAKER_00: I become Uber's first political advisor that day.
[00:00:16] SPEAKER_00: I get really lucky when Travis calls back.
[00:00:18] SPEAKER_00: It's his lesson.
[00:00:19] SPEAKER_00: Can't afford your fee.
[00:00:20] SPEAKER_00: Would you take that quickly?
[00:00:21] SPEAKER_00: And thank God I think, yes.
[00:00:23] SPEAKER_00: What is the biggest lesson you learned from working with Travis County?
[00:00:28] SPEAKER_02: I am an unapologetic Travis enthusiast.
[00:00:31] SPEAKER_00: Did he make mistakes?
[00:00:32] SPEAKER_00: Absolutely.
[00:00:33] SPEAKER_00: No, Travis fans will hear this and be angry about it.
[00:00:36] SPEAKER_00: I don't care.
[00:00:37] SPEAKER_00: Bradley Tusk, welcome to Sorcery.
[00:00:48] SPEAKER_02: Hey, Molly, thanks for having me.
[00:00:49] SPEAKER_00: We have so much to talk about today.
[00:00:51] SPEAKER_02: I know.
[00:00:52] SPEAKER_00: So just to tell the audience, we were chatting.
[00:00:54] SPEAKER_00: And then Molly looks at the producer.
[00:00:57] SPEAKER_00: Tell me what you're doing.
[00:00:58] Lance Lance, right?
[00:00:59] SPEAKER_00: And said, we got that right.
[00:01:01] SPEAKER_00: And it's like, no, you didn't tell me to press for court.
[00:01:03] SPEAKER_00: So we're going to have to do all of it.
[00:01:05] We're going to have to do it all over again.
[00:01:06] SPEAKER_02: Let's talk about that.
[00:01:07] SPEAKER_02: Let's talk about the sub stack you're putting out right now.
[00:01:09] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:01:10] SPEAKER_00: So what we were just talking about is I've got a sub stack about to come out that
[00:01:14] SPEAKER_00: says that I at least have a suspicion that all of this massive AI infrastructure
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_00: investment.
[00:01:21] SPEAKER_00: So it's 1.5 trillion and 2025, projected to be 2 trillion in 2026, is really about the
[00:01:30] SPEAKER_00: short-term share price evaluation of the big AI companies, the generative companies,
[00:01:35] SPEAKER_00: where the company supply CPUs.
[00:01:37] SPEAKER_00: That's disguised as long-term thinking.
[00:01:39] SPEAKER_00: So investors like two things, and you know, this better than I do at this point, but
[00:01:43] SPEAKER_00: like, A would be the fundamentals of a company itself, but B oftentimes even more so is
[00:01:48] SPEAKER_00: the narrative.
[00:01:49] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[00:01:50] SPEAKER_00: But it should not be worth a fraction of what it's worth today if not for the narrative
[00:01:55] SPEAKER_00: and the belief by investors that Elon, and he is a genius, but like that Elon will
[00:01:59] SPEAKER_00: just figure things out that no one can predict, including Elon right now.
[00:02:03] SPEAKER_00: And therefore the value is worth it, right?
[00:02:05] SPEAKER_00: And then occasionally someone short-stocked, they looked it for a little while.
[00:02:08] SPEAKER_00: The way that's on narrative, right?
[00:02:10] SPEAKER_00: I mean, Toyota should be an infinitely more valuable company than Tesla.
[00:02:14] SPEAKER_00: And yet, yeah, I haven't checked it in more capital while, but last I checked it was like
[00:02:16] SPEAKER_00: less than a quarter.
[00:02:18] SPEAKER_00: So oftentimes if you can sell investors aren't, hey, we're doing something really brilliant
[00:02:25] SPEAKER_00: for the long-term future of people like, great, here's my money.
[00:02:30] SPEAKER_00: And they double down, they triple down.
[00:02:32] SPEAKER_00: And in reality, it may be that the way that we think AI will happen in the next 10, 20
[00:02:39] SPEAKER_00: years is the way that we is today.
[00:02:41] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[00:02:42] SPEAKER_00: So right now what we assume is you need massive amounts of compute.
[00:02:45] SPEAKER_00: So the chips from the video and everyone else are incredibly valuable.
[00:02:48] SPEAKER_00: You need mass amounts of energy to power that compute.
[00:02:52] SPEAKER_00: So all the insular businesses are valuable.
[00:02:55] SPEAKER_00: And therefore, you need to produce as much capacity as possible for the future.
[00:03:00] SPEAKER_00: That might be true, but it might not be true, right?
[00:03:03] SPEAKER_00: So for example, we know that when DeepSea came out with their model, it was an inference
[00:03:08] SPEAKER_00: model, right?
[00:03:09] SPEAKER_00: That basically said, instead of having to sort of generate everything from scratch every
[00:03:11] SPEAKER_00: time, we'll say that if A leads to B and B leads to C, we'll assume C is correct and
[00:03:16] SPEAKER_00: just give you D.
[00:03:18] SPEAKER_00: Now, is it as accurate?
[00:03:20] SPEAKER_00: No, but is it possibly 90% of the accurate?
[00:03:23] SPEAKER_00: Yes.
[00:03:24] SPEAKER_00: Now it's Chinese companies, so for all we know, it's all bullshit, right?
[00:03:26] SPEAKER_00: And it might not be true at all.
[00:03:27] SPEAKER_00: We don't know.
[00:03:28] SPEAKER_00: But let's just take the off chance that they're not lying, right?
[00:03:32] SPEAKER_00: And it's true.
[00:03:34] SPEAKER_00: At least for the way that I use AI, 90% is more than good enough, right?
[00:03:38] SPEAKER_00: I'm basically using it in lieu of Google these days.
[00:03:41] SPEAKER_00: And so ultimately, if you said to me, this thing costs $10 and this thing costs $1 and
[00:03:48] SPEAKER_00: this thing costs $1 and 90% is good, I'm taking the thing that costs $1.
[00:03:52] SPEAKER_00: If that's true, you probably didn't need the $2 trillion in infrastructure spending,
[00:03:57] SPEAKER_00: which means these companies are going to be crippled by debt, right?
[00:04:01] SPEAKER_00: It's fine to take out the debt and everyone to be excited while you're doing so and boost
[00:04:04] SPEAKER_00: the share price.
[00:04:06] SPEAKER_00: And by the way, if you are the executive of these companies, you're not worth is the current
[00:04:11] SPEAKER_00: share price and whatever you can sell, right?
[00:04:12] SPEAKER_00: Not what it's going to be in 20 years.
[00:04:14] SPEAKER_00: If anyone knows to get out, it's probably you.
[00:04:17] SPEAKER_00: So I do worry a little bit that a lot of the investment that's happening is really about
[00:04:22] SPEAKER_00: driving the narrative and therefore the valuation, if it's private or the share price
[00:04:26] SPEAKER_00: of its public today, as opposed to what the economy will actually need in a decade or two
[00:04:31] SPEAKER_00: from now.
[00:04:32] Can you break down where that capital is going within the $2 trillion?
[00:04:36] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:04:37] SPEAKER_02: A lot of it are things like data centers.
[00:04:40] SPEAKER_00: So data center ultimately, I don't invest in them because there's no real regulatory
[00:04:46] SPEAKER_00: issue.
[00:04:47] SPEAKER_00: We'll get into it that.
[00:04:48] SPEAKER_00: I mean, a little bit of permitting in its own name, but not that much.
[00:04:50] SPEAKER_00: But I see deals, right?
[00:04:51] SPEAKER_00: And I occasionally take a look at them.
[00:04:54] SPEAKER_00: Some of it is physical capacity, servers, land.
[00:04:59] SPEAKER_00: You can't really put a giant data center in the middle of Manhattan because it would cost
[00:05:03] SPEAKER_00: 10 times as much, right?
[00:05:04] SPEAKER_00: One is where you're going to put it, right?
[00:05:06] SPEAKER_00: So our landslives in New Jersey, it's a better location for a data center that where I live
[00:05:10] SPEAKER_00: and so on, right?
[00:05:11] SPEAKER_00: That's one.
[00:05:12] SPEAKER_00: Two would be actual chips from the video or whoever the maker might be until whoever it
[00:05:18] SPEAKER_00: is because you need very, very advanced GPUs, processing units in order to be able to generate
[00:05:26] SPEAKER_00: that level of AGI.
[00:05:28] SPEAKER_00: And therefore those are really, really expensive because the demand is so high, basic economics.
[00:05:34] SPEAKER_00: If there's massive demand for GPUs, guess what?
[00:05:36] SPEAKER_00: Cost more money, GPUs.
[00:05:39] SPEAKER_00: And especially if there are trade restrictions around it, that further shapes the market, right?
[00:05:44] SPEAKER_00: So that's, and then energy, right?
[00:05:45] SPEAKER_00: So essentially I was talking, I won't name them, I was talking to a guy who, right,
[00:05:48] SPEAKER_00: wrote for governor for months, give it that.
[00:05:51] SPEAKER_00: And he was, you know, basically when you are a political donor like me, they pretend
[00:05:55] SPEAKER_00: to ask you for sort of strategy and policy ideas before they ask you for the money.
[00:05:59] SPEAKER_00: And so we were doing that.
[00:06:01] SPEAKER_00: Give my back where I have a little bit of that today on the campaign side, I guess.
[00:06:04] SPEAKER_00: But, and I was saying to him, because Vermont is a state that has great hydroelectric power,
[00:06:11] SPEAKER_00: if I were you, I would really build a campaign platform around building data centers in Vermont,
[00:06:18] SPEAKER_00: generate economic development, generate tax revenue, generate jobs.
[00:06:22] SPEAKER_00: And the play is, hey, we can provide this energy for incredibly low cost and it's clean
[00:06:28] SPEAKER_00: energy, which voters in Vermont care about, right?
[00:06:31] SPEAKER_00: Some states that wouldn't matter, but it does there.
[00:06:33] SPEAKER_00: And I said, I don't even know if it's absolutely right or not, but it's no more wrong
[00:06:37] SPEAKER_00: than the narrative right now driving the market.
[00:06:39] SPEAKER_00: And if investors are buying it with their money, my guess is that it'll more than stand
[00:06:43] SPEAKER_00: up to some political reporter, take a quick look at it.
[00:06:46] SPEAKER_00: We'll see if he does it or not.
[00:06:47] SPEAKER_00: We'll see if he runs or not.
[00:06:49] SPEAKER_00: But, but nonetheless, you know, energy is obviously a really big component.
[00:06:54] SPEAKER_00: And in fact, if there's one larger societal externality that's positive around this,
[00:07:01] SPEAKER_00: even if it turns out the money's a little bit of a waste and stop me when this gets too
[00:07:04] SPEAKER_00: walkie, but is we really do need to return to nuclear energy in this country.
[00:07:11] SPEAKER_00: And if microgrid nuclear becomes a thing because of the need for energy to power the compute,
[00:07:20] SPEAKER_00: that's a worthwhile outcome.
[00:07:23] SPEAKER_00: It's interesting, you know, I'm a lot older than you.
[00:07:27] SPEAKER_00: And yet I'm still young enough that three mile an hour happened before my level of consciousness,
[00:07:33] SPEAKER_00: right?
[00:07:34] SPEAKER_00: And what I have noticed, try this out, going forward as an experiment.
[00:07:37] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:07:38] If you talk to anyone who's probably so I'm 52, right?
[00:07:41] SPEAKER_00: So anyone who's my age or younger, yeah, there are, we should have nuclear power.
[00:07:46] SPEAKER_00: Absolutely.
[00:07:47] SPEAKER_00: It is plentiful.
[00:07:48] SPEAKER_00: It's expensive to generate, but the ones you do, it's a lot cheaper and it's totally
[00:07:52] SPEAKER_00: environmentally clean.
[00:07:54] SPEAKER_00: It makes total sense.
[00:07:55] SPEAKER_00: Yes, there's some risk, but the tradeoff is we're destroying the climate right now,
[00:07:59] SPEAKER_00: which has all kinds of risk, right?
[00:08:00] SPEAKER_00: Massive hurricanes and earthquakes and tornadoes.
[00:08:02] SPEAKER_00: So like those risky their way, anyone for whom they were kind of aware enough, maybe
[00:08:09] SPEAKER_00: I don't know, 10 or 12 and older, when three mile an hour happened, totally different
[00:08:13] SPEAKER_00: perspective for them.
[00:08:14] SPEAKER_00: They're like, no, no, no, that's crazy.
[00:08:17] SPEAKER_00: Way too risky.
[00:08:18] SPEAKER_00: We got it.
[00:08:19] SPEAKER_00: We can't do nuclear.
[00:08:20] SPEAKER_00: And so I think that as that group ages out of power, there will be a lot more acceptance
[00:08:28] SPEAKER_00: of nuclear again because I'm pretty old at this point and I'm still on the young side
[00:08:31] SPEAKER_00: for this particular issue.
[00:08:34] SPEAKER_00: So one good thing that might come out of all this, even if it turns out that a lot of
[00:08:38] SPEAKER_00: the spend ends up being unnecessary and therefore, by the way, it lost for the shareholders
[00:08:43] SPEAKER_00: of those companies eventually, right?
[00:08:46] SPEAKER_00: Because maybe we will get a much better clean energy system out of it.
[00:08:50] SPEAKER_00: And for whatever reason, Trump who is wildly opposed to wind and solar for reasons that
[00:08:55] SPEAKER_00: still don't make that much sense to me, doesn't seem to have a problem with clear.
[00:08:59] SPEAKER_00: There's like many different points in there that we can unpack.
[00:09:02] SPEAKER_02: It's really interesting seeing how many data center deals are coming through.
[00:09:05] SPEAKER_02: Endless.
[00:09:06] SPEAKER_02: I see endless because it's a new gold rush.
[00:09:09] SPEAKER_02: It has a gold rush.
[00:09:10] SPEAKER_02: It's causing all these different picks and shovels.
[00:09:13] SPEAKER_02: Infrastructure is definitely a part of that.
[00:09:14] SPEAKER_02: We have like training, we have nuclear, we've got energy, we've got the power bottlenecks,
[00:09:19] SPEAKER_02: and then we also have the data center bottlenecks.
[00:09:21] SPEAKER_02: And then we also don't know what is actually going to be the moonshot unlock here.
[00:09:27] SPEAKER_02: Because there are lots of things going on under the surface that we're just, we're betting
[00:09:32] SPEAKER_02: on incrementalism for most of these valuations.
[00:09:34] SPEAKER_02: We're betting on incrementalism with these companies and how they're going to compound.
[00:09:38] SPEAKER_02: We're not taking into effect what's going to be the moonshot unlock.
[00:09:42] SPEAKER_02: What if deep seek was the moonshot?
[00:09:44] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:09:45] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:09:46] SPEAKER_00: What if the inference model was the thing that's like, oh, we only need 10% of the energy
[00:09:49] SPEAKER_00: in the compute.
[00:09:50] SPEAKER_00: And it turns out that this other 90% is basically wasteful.
[00:09:54] SPEAKER_00: I mean, I don't know.
[00:09:56] SPEAKER_00: And it will weird briefly American economy.
[00:09:58] SPEAKER_00: I guess I hope that deep seek is wrong.
[00:10:01] SPEAKER_00: But putting that aside, yeah, we don't know.
[00:10:04] SPEAKER_00: And by the way, the most ironic thing is the underlying thing we're talking about here
[00:10:08] SPEAKER_00: is AI.
[00:10:10] SPEAKER_00: And if anything can figure out the moonshot, it's AI.
[00:10:13] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[00:10:14] SPEAKER_00: So that's the most ironic part of all of it.
[00:10:16] SPEAKER_00: Or for example, if you start taking this as like third and fourth kind of gradient thinking,
[00:10:22] SPEAKER_00: like, okay, so maybe most AI infrastructure spend turns out to be wasteful.
[00:10:27] SPEAKER_00: But maybe the upside is that nuclear happens as a result.
[00:10:31] SPEAKER_00: And maybe because of that, we have so much AI processing power that then the AI exists
[00:10:39] SPEAKER_00: to figure out decarbonization overall.
[00:10:41] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:10:42] SPEAKER_00: Like it seems to me.
[00:10:43] SPEAKER_00: You know, I'll recycle something today.
[00:10:45] SPEAKER_00: I'm sure.
[00:10:46] SPEAKER_00: But as someone who works in New York City government for a long time, it all goes from the
[00:10:49] SPEAKER_00: same way.
[00:10:50] SPEAKER_02: It does.
[00:10:51] SPEAKER_02: It does.
[00:10:52] SPEAKER_02: I don't know why people do this.
[00:10:53] SPEAKER_00: I do it just because it's like literally two bins I put in the right one.
[00:10:54] SPEAKER_00: My sister gets fined at her apartment.
[00:10:55] SPEAKER_02: I'm like, I don't care.
[00:10:56] SPEAKER_02: I'm not washing it because it's all going to the same place.
[00:10:59] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:11:00] SPEAKER_00: But so to me, that's not going to solve climate change.
[00:11:03] SPEAKER_00: If we solve climate change, if it's because we eventually figure out how to effectively
[00:11:08] SPEAKER_00: remove carbon from the atmosphere and think of like that, whether it's sucking it out
[00:11:13] SPEAKER_00: or trees that can absorb more CO2 or whatever it might be.
[00:11:17] SPEAKER_00: And that probably is a challenge for AI because they're carbon capture plants and startups
[00:11:23] SPEAKER_00: right now.
[00:11:24] SPEAKER_00: You've probably even talked to some of them.
[00:11:25] SPEAKER_00: And they're really interesting, but it's like very nascent.
[00:11:28] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:11:29] SPEAKER_00: It's still a pretty big risk if you were an investor because it's an incredible amount
[00:11:34] SPEAKER_00: of catbacks for something that still may or may not work.
[00:11:39] SPEAKER_00: But if we do solve climate change, I have this general view and now I'm probably getting
[00:11:43] SPEAKER_00: wake off.
[00:11:44] SPEAKER_00: You have to land scrap that in the South.
[00:11:45] SPEAKER_00: It's going to lay off, of course.
[00:11:47] SPEAKER_00: But I have a token of humanity sometimes as we are an erase to save ourselves before
[00:11:53] SPEAKER_00: we destroy ourselves because we are doing both things simultaneously all the time.
[00:11:58] SPEAKER_00: So think about climate change.
[00:12:02] SPEAKER_00: And they meant the car when they meant the hairspray, whatever it is, right.
[00:12:05] SPEAKER_00: Things are ended up in one way or another being badly.
[00:12:08] SPEAKER_00: No one said my goal is to destroy the ozone layer.
[00:12:12] SPEAKER_00: What I really want to do is make the earth uninhabitable in a hundred years.
[00:12:16] SPEAKER_00: That's why I'm preventing this product.
[00:12:17] SPEAKER_00: It was I have something that has value to consumers, right?
[00:12:21] SPEAKER_00: That has value to society.
[00:12:23] SPEAKER_00: The car fundamentally transformed the economy, right?
[00:12:26] SPEAKER_00: Hairspray, aerosol as a product is before my time, but obviously became a time of more
[00:12:33] SPEAKER_00: convenient cost effective way for people to be able to do their hair.
[00:12:37] SPEAKER_00: Fine, right?
[00:12:38] SPEAKER_00: There's nothing really wrong with that.
[00:12:39] SPEAKER_00: I mean, if you think about every startup founder that I talked to about investing or
[00:12:41] SPEAKER_00: you talked to, you know, in an interview, it's fundamentally, they believe they have
[00:12:48] SPEAKER_00: a product or service that has some utility.
[00:12:50] SPEAKER_00: Otherwise, they wouldn't be doing it, right?
[00:12:54] So in all these cases, and then it turns out that in these good things that happen like
[00:12:58] SPEAKER_00: economic transformation, because now we have a car instead of a horse and buggy, there's
[00:13:02] SPEAKER_00: also fossil fuels that are being burned and polluted, which then lead to other things.
[00:13:08] SPEAKER_00: So then we have new technology, ultimately, you know, hopefully through AI, until like,
[00:13:12] SPEAKER_00: okay, now we're going to find a way to take the fuel and take the toxins that came from
[00:13:17] SPEAKER_00: the fuel out of the atmosphere, right?
[00:13:19] SPEAKER_00: So we're vaccines, right?
[00:13:24] SPEAKER_00: So like putting aside the whole crazy anti-vaxxer thing right now, like vaccines were a scientific
[00:13:30] SPEAKER_00: development to figure out how to take diseases that occurred typically in nature and protect
[00:13:36] SPEAKER_00: people from them, right?
[00:13:38] SPEAKER_00: A lot of that same learning leads to advancement of bioethans, right?
[00:13:43] SPEAKER_00: Which could be incredibly dangerous and wipe us all out.
[00:13:48] SPEAKER_00: And then at the same time, they're working on more vaccines to be able to contradict
[00:13:53] SPEAKER_00: the potential risk of bio-opens, right?
[00:13:55] SPEAKER_00: We're even nuclear.
[00:13:57] SPEAKER_00: You know, when Truman dropped the bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, you can debate today whether
[00:14:05] SPEAKER_00: or not it was a good idea, but like, there was a clear purpose to it, right?
[00:14:09] SPEAKER_00: Which was, we were a war, we had been at war at that point for five or six years, 38th
[00:14:14] or now, wherever we got in.
[00:14:17] Anyway, so, and it needed to end, right?
[00:14:21] SPEAKER_00: And that was the way to end the war.
[00:14:23] SPEAKER_00: Like, I don't know that if I were president, I would have reached any different conclusion
[00:14:26] SPEAKER_00: than Truman did, right?
[00:14:28] SPEAKER_00: However, it's also the thing that is easiest way for us to sort of destroy humanity.
[00:14:35] And arguably, the greatest achievement of human history is that no one of the last eight
[00:14:39] SPEAKER_00: of years has used nuclear weapons, even though it's pull it free to now, to I think nine
[00:14:44] SPEAKER_00: countries, plus whatever Iran does or doesn't have.
[00:14:47] SPEAKER_00: So, and then the question becomes, in that case, there might not be a technology that can
[00:14:53] SPEAKER_00: counteract nuclear, but can we advance enough as human beings to remove them as a threat,
[00:15:00] SPEAKER_00: right?
[00:15:01] SPEAKER_00: So it's just, it's always like, by definition, because human beings are so unavoidable,
[00:15:06] right?
[00:15:07] SPEAKER_00: We're only like, at most, we've been a species in this form for a couple of hundred
[00:15:11] SPEAKER_00: thousand years, and most of the stuff that I read is more like 60,000 years.
[00:15:15] SPEAKER_00: I mean, the universe is 14.8 billion years old.
[00:15:20] SPEAKER_00: The earth is something like four and a half billion years old.
[00:15:23] SPEAKER_00: So, you know, like the average human lifetime, even with a hundred years, is like point zero,
[00:15:29] SPEAKER_00: and you have like 10 zeros before you even get to a one of the entirety of the universe.
[00:15:36] SPEAKER_00: So, like we're so new and so unvolved that we're like just fascinating.
[00:15:42] SPEAKER_00: Like in some ways, like you can almost see humanity as like the ultimate Shakespearean
[00:15:47] SPEAKER_00: play that the gods created to be like, let's entertain ourselves.
[00:15:51] SPEAKER_00: Let's create these beings.
[00:15:52] SPEAKER_00: There are some ways amazing and some ways horrible, some ways brilliant, some ways moronic,
[00:15:58] SPEAKER_00: right?
[00:15:59] SPEAKER_00: And let's just draw all fucking together and see what happens.
[00:16:02] SPEAKER_00: It's reality TV, right?
[00:16:03] SPEAKER_00: But like in some ways, you know, imagine it from a macro standpoint, you know, and we're
[00:16:10] SPEAKER_00: so perfectly imperfect that we're just in this constant race to sort of both advance
[00:16:16] SPEAKER_00: ourselves and save ourselves without destroying ourselves.
[00:16:20] SPEAKER_00: And then that gets to, and this is anything of far more philosophical podcasts than you
[00:16:24] SPEAKER_00: meant to have.
[00:16:25] SPEAKER_00: I love it.
[00:16:26] SPEAKER_00: But like arguably I would say the central question of our time is zero or some verse
[00:16:31] SPEAKER_00: abundance, right?
[00:16:33] SPEAKER_00: So there are really two fundamental ways to do the world.
[00:16:37] SPEAKER_00: One would be the everyone's for themselves, everyone's first, everyone, and you just have
[00:16:42] SPEAKER_00: to get as much as you can in the time that you have without the cost to you being so severe
[00:16:46] SPEAKER_00: that it outweighs the benefit, right?
[00:16:48] SPEAKER_00: Which, you know, in some cases, means people like literally just figure out ways to not
[00:16:52] SPEAKER_00: get indicted for things or whatever it is.
[00:16:56] SPEAKER_00: And whoever has the most toys wins, right?
[00:16:58] SPEAKER_00: And I think Trump in many ways is the ultimate manifestation of his hero, some mentality,
[00:17:03] SPEAKER_00: right?
[00:17:04] SPEAKER_00: You know, he views success in life as who has the most money, who has the most power,
[00:17:08] SPEAKER_00: who has the most influence, who has the most beautiful woman, who has the most luxurious
[00:17:12] SPEAKER_00: airplane, the most gold plating, literally whatever it is.
[00:17:16] SPEAKER_00: He doesn't ever seem particularly happy to me, even though he accumulates more of that
[00:17:21] SPEAKER_00: at this point combined, maybe than anyone, right?
[00:17:24] SPEAKER_00: And the other way would be sort of an abundance mentality, which is we're happier when we're
[00:17:32] SPEAKER_00: doing things that give us some sense of purpose and meaning.
[00:17:35] SPEAKER_00: So I've studied like a ton of happiness science and behavioral economics, like I studied
[00:17:38] SPEAKER_00: behavioral economics when I was in school.
[00:17:40] SPEAKER_00: And then in my 40s, I started studying happiness science in part because my own life wasn't
[00:17:46] SPEAKER_00: that happy at the time.
[00:17:47] SPEAKER_00: And as I was realizing I needed to get a divorce at the same time, I was sort of trying to
[00:17:50] SPEAKER_00: really understand what is it that makes human beings happy.
[00:17:54] SPEAKER_00: And there's really just two things, right?
[00:17:58] SPEAKER_00: It's relationships where there are people in your life who love and support you unconditionally
[00:18:03] SPEAKER_00: and you love and support them unconditionally.
[00:18:05] SPEAKER_00: It doesn't mean you can have disagreements with them or disapprove of something, but fundamentally
[00:18:09] SPEAKER_00: that's there and the things that give you meaning and purpose, right?
[00:18:13] SPEAKER_00: So for example, you've been to my bookstore.
[00:18:15] SPEAKER_00: I'm trying to book store on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
[00:18:18] SPEAKER_00: It is a bookstore.
[00:18:19] SPEAKER_00: It is a podcast idea that anyone in New York can use or anyone wherever it can use for
[00:18:22] SPEAKER_00: free, an event space and a cafe.
[00:18:25] SPEAKER_00: It loses so much money.
[00:18:27] SPEAKER_00: It is the worst business in all of New York.
[00:18:30] SPEAKER_00: However, the way I look at it is, I look at how much money do I lose on the bookstore.
[00:18:37] SPEAKER_00: It's funny how they came up with lunch with friends and they literally gasped.
[00:18:42] SPEAKER_00: But at the same time, I mean, I was around million bucks here.
[00:18:45] SPEAKER_00: Oh my God.
[00:18:46] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:18:47] SPEAKER_00: But so here's what I did.
[00:18:50] SPEAKER_00: I don't fly private.
[00:18:52] SPEAKER_00: And yesterday I had a disaster trip up for time.
[00:18:54] SPEAKER_00: I'm just going probably what's that I had.
[00:18:56] SPEAKER_00: But like most of the time, it's fine, right?
[00:18:58] SPEAKER_00: 98% of the time.
[00:19:00] SPEAKER_00: And I looked at, okay, let's say that over the course of the year, I travel a lot, right?
[00:19:06] SPEAKER_00: Domestically, if I just flew private instead of flying commercial, or what I spent.
[00:19:10] SPEAKER_00: And ended up being about the same amount of money that I lose on the bookstore.
[00:19:14] SPEAKER_00: So I was like, okay, this is a great A, B test.
[00:19:16] SPEAKER_00: Forget about whatever the bookstore does for anybody else.
[00:19:19] SPEAKER_00: And you know, sure, great some jobs, people who are the podcast are take, put all that
[00:19:24] SPEAKER_00: of stuff, right?
[00:19:25] SPEAKER_00: Just fundamentally for me, for Bradley, which of these two things will make me happier?
[00:19:29] SPEAKER_00: Because it's the ultimate sort of zero sum versus abundance sort of A, B test, right?
[00:19:34] SPEAKER_00: So if I spent that money on flying private, what do I get?
[00:19:38] SPEAKER_00: A little more convenience to avoid the TSA line, which usually with clear and pre-shacks
[00:19:42] SPEAKER_00: like a minute, right?
[00:19:44] SPEAKER_00: But sometimes maybe it's 10.
[00:19:47] And I would find ways to brag to people sort of like, you know, in a nuanced way that
[00:19:52] SPEAKER_00: I flew private, right?
[00:19:53] SPEAKER_00: And then they probably think I'm a douchebag anyway, right?
[00:19:55] SPEAKER_00: But nonetheless, that's sort of the upside of flying private.
[00:19:58] And upside of the bookstore, I record my podcast there twice a week.
[00:20:02] SPEAKER_00: I should plug it.
[00:20:03] SPEAKER_00: It's called Firewall.
[00:20:04] SPEAKER_00: If you like this, you know, like that.
[00:20:05] SPEAKER_00: If you don't like this, you definitely won't like that.
[00:20:08] SPEAKER_00: We have events there all the time.
[00:20:11] SPEAKER_00: I take meetings there on Fridays usually.
[00:20:14] SPEAKER_00: But most of all, do you know what I like about it?
[00:20:16] SPEAKER_00: People pat me on the head constantly and tell me how wonderful I am because I own a money
[00:20:20] SPEAKER_00: losing indie bookstore in New York City.
[00:20:22] SPEAKER_00: And people like bookstores.
[00:20:23] SPEAKER_00: And I get a lot of validation information.
[00:20:27] SPEAKER_00: So the meaning and purpose I got from the bookstore, not because it does anything for
[00:20:31] SPEAKER_00: anyone else, but simply because if you just said, which are these two things will make
[00:20:37] SPEAKER_00: me feel better?
[00:20:39] SPEAKER_00: People admire me and praising me because I flew private or people admire me and praising
[00:20:44] SPEAKER_00: me because I own a money losing bookstore.
[00:20:46] SPEAKER_00: It is like the ROI significantly greater on the bookstore, right?
[00:20:50] SPEAKER_00: It's from a pure, selfish standpoint.
[00:20:52] SPEAKER_00: So I would argue that for happiness generation, the two things that are proven to be the most
[00:20:58] SPEAKER_00: effective are cultivating and really investing in relationships with people who you really
[00:21:02] SPEAKER_00: care about and really care about you.
[00:21:04] SPEAKER_00: So like, for example, I keep a running list of the 50 people at a given moment who I kind
[00:21:08] SPEAKER_00: of mattered to me the most.
[00:21:10] SPEAKER_00: And it involves a little bit of a time.
[00:21:12] SPEAKER_00: And then usually once a week on the weekend, I'll just run through it.
[00:21:15] SPEAKER_00: I'm like, okay, I haven't talked to someone so in a week or two weeks or three weeks or
[00:21:18] SPEAKER_00: whatever.
[00:21:19] SPEAKER_00: So I'll call and you know what?
[00:21:22] SPEAKER_00: No one has ever done tax back saying, why are you bothered me?
[00:21:25] SPEAKER_00: It's always like, hey, great to hear from you, right?
[00:21:27] SPEAKER_00: And then you have a pleasant exchange that might lead to some sort of plan or it might
[00:21:30] SPEAKER_00: just be a nice check in or whatever it is, but either way.
[00:21:35] SPEAKER_00: And then I try to really look at almost and look, I am lucky to be a point in life where
[00:21:38] SPEAKER_00: I have enough money to do what I want to do.
[00:21:41] SPEAKER_00: But I also choose not to do certain.
[00:21:43] SPEAKER_00: I don't have a big house in the himptons, right?
[00:21:44] SPEAKER_00: I don't have a plane or boat or anything like that because I invest in stuff that I care
[00:21:48] SPEAKER_00: about instead.
[00:21:50] SPEAKER_00: And I truly believe that I have figured out kind of the formula in many ways to happiness
[00:21:56] SPEAKER_00: because I effectively just prioritize relationships and purpose out of everything else.
[00:22:01] SPEAKER_00: Still make money.
[00:22:02] SPEAKER_00: I still need to make money to do the things that I care about and to further them.
[00:22:07] SPEAKER_00: But and I also just like making money and not being a business.
[00:22:11] SPEAKER_00: But nonetheless, I truly believe that if you can adopt the mentality, your odds of long
[00:22:16] SPEAKER_00: terms, just staying happiness or significantly greater.
[00:22:19] SPEAKER_00: And I think whether or not humanity realizes that, especially in the first world where
[00:22:24] SPEAKER_00: you don't have to worry about, you know, some people do, but the vast majority of Americans
[00:22:28] SPEAKER_00: don't have to worry about, you know, being homeless or don't have to worry about not having
[00:22:33] SPEAKER_00: any access to healthcare of any kind, right?
[00:22:35] SPEAKER_00: This Lisa is an emergency room or something.
[00:22:37] SPEAKER_00: Assuming that you have the very basic covered, at that point, it becomes really a question
[00:22:42] SPEAKER_00: of maximizing happiness becomes a math question.
[00:22:46] SPEAKER_00: And that ultimately gets to zero sum versus abundance.
[00:22:49] SPEAKER_00: And I really think that it is both on an individual level, the most important question that we
[00:22:53] SPEAKER_00: can answer for ourselves and on a societal level.
[00:22:56] SPEAKER_00: If we want to sort of bring ourselves to extension in the next 50 or 100 years, zero sum
[00:23:01] SPEAKER_00: is a great way to do that.
[00:23:03] SPEAKER_00: If we want to see our children, children, children, children live and thrive, then it's
[00:23:09] SPEAKER_00: got to be an abundant approach.
[00:23:10] SPEAKER_00: And like, ultimately to me, that's what life comes down to.

[00:25:37] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:25:38] SPEAKER_02: It's really interesting.
[00:25:39] SPEAKER_02: I'm thinking about a couple of the past conversations I've had and how this relates
[00:25:43] SPEAKER_02: to job and purpose and meaning.
[00:25:46] SPEAKER_02: And there are some people I interviewed, Navine Shada from Mayfield, and he says, oh, well,
[00:25:53] SPEAKER_02: with AI, we'll be able to do as much as we want.
[00:25:55] SPEAKER_02: We'll be able to work from Hawaii.
[00:25:56] SPEAKER_02: We can have five jobs because it'll all be running and we'll have just more time to
[00:26:00] SPEAKER_02: ourselves.
[00:26:01] SPEAKER_02: Same with Jonathan from Turing.
[00:26:02] SPEAKER_02: He says the same thing.
[00:26:03] SPEAKER_02: Like, why can't I run like 10 companies like Elon?
[00:26:06] SPEAKER_02: Like, I could do multiple things if I wanted to or maybe not, but it does present an opportunity
[00:26:12] SPEAKER_02: because I mean, I've seen in my day today, like I now have like so many projects all the
[00:26:16] SPEAKER_02: time because I can get so much more done.
[00:26:18] SPEAKER_02: But for some people, like there are other constraints.
[00:26:21] SPEAKER_02: So much of that though.
[00:26:22] SPEAKER_00: Let me just challenge it for a second, right?
[00:26:23] SPEAKER_00: Which is yes.
[00:26:25] SPEAKER_00: But you choosing to do that is that ultimately your ability to do it successfully, which
[00:26:30] SPEAKER_00: you do, is it the product of, oh, here's this technology that before just wasn't available
[00:26:36] SPEAKER_00: to me and therefore it made impossible or you make choices, right?
[00:26:40] SPEAKER_00: And the choices you make, by the way, include all kinds of sacrifices, right?
[00:26:44] SPEAKER_00: I mean, we were talking before the podcast about like you live in LA.
[00:26:47] SPEAKER_00: I hope you're scared of that.
[00:26:50] SPEAKER_00: Like, it's a pain in the ass.
[00:26:52] SPEAKER_00: Because you're what's in New Yorkers and Francesco, right?
[00:26:54] SPEAKER_00: But like the only way we make choices and the choices facilitate what you can then do,
[00:27:00] SPEAKER_00: right?
[00:27:01] SPEAKER_00: Like, for example, I spent a ton of money on my team because everything that I don't want
[00:27:07] SPEAKER_00: to do and don't have to do, I don't do.
[00:27:10] SPEAKER_00: And that frees me up to do all the things that I do want to do.
[00:27:13] SPEAKER_00: And that's why I have like multiple companies and foundation and all kinds of other stuff.
[00:27:17] SPEAKER_00: Because in part, I pay other people to do a lot of things for me.
[00:27:21] SPEAKER_00: What does that mean?
[00:27:22] SPEAKER_00: I have less money at the end of the day, right?
[00:27:25] SPEAKER_00: I made that choice.
[00:27:26] SPEAKER_00: So do you buy the notion that it's technology or is it really fundamentally just about
[00:27:31] SPEAKER_00: your choices?
[00:27:32] SPEAKER_02: No, I think it's absolutely choices.
[00:27:33] SPEAKER_02: Like, I choose to work really hard because I like working really hard.
[00:27:36] SPEAKER_02: And I also have this like moment in time where there's so much momentum that I am taking
[00:27:41] SPEAKER_02: opportunity.
[00:27:42] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[00:27:43] SPEAKER_02: I do know that I am making so many sacrifices.
[00:27:45] SPEAKER_02: I'm making sacrifices to friends.
[00:27:47] SPEAKER_02: I'm constantly letting them down because I have to work making sacrifices to my family.
[00:27:51] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:27:52] SPEAKER_02: I'm not going to certain events.
[00:27:53] SPEAKER_02: I'm close.
[00:27:54] SPEAKER_02: They all live in Connecticut.
[00:27:55] SPEAKER_02: I don't do that much.
[00:27:56] SPEAKER_02: I have sacrifices for my own personal life.
[00:27:57] SPEAKER_02: Like different decisions not to go on dates.
[00:27:59] SPEAKER_02: So just cancel things because I just want to work.
[00:28:02] SPEAKER_02: And like I'm constantly traveling between cities.
[00:28:04] SPEAKER_02: I have a selfish region of like having my apartment in a life because between all this chaos
[00:28:09] SPEAKER_02: I like to go back to there and like have a weekend.
[00:28:12] SPEAKER_02: And then I like to go run around and like do all my interviews.
[00:28:15] SPEAKER_02: But I know that's a choice.
[00:28:17] SPEAKER_02: Like I know for a fact, there are some people that do have access to this technology and
[00:28:20] SPEAKER_02: they don't care.
[00:28:21] SPEAKER_02: But like they just they just use it for the day to day and then they you know have their
[00:28:24] SPEAKER_02: leisurely activities.
[00:28:26] SPEAKER_02: But unfortunately I'm competitive and I want to succeed.
[00:28:30] SPEAKER_02: So I'm like, how can I maximize my opportunities right now in this window?
[00:28:34] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[00:28:35] You at least I will say, how do you?
[00:28:38] You have vastly more self-awareness than I had.
[00:28:41] SPEAKER_00: And so I the same.
[00:28:43] SPEAKER_00: In some ways still do have the same mentality that you have right now.
[00:28:48] SPEAKER_00: But I think where you're probably way advanced to me and that probably gender is part of
[00:28:52] SPEAKER_00: that too is now that I think what you thought, but I thought the people who didn't make the
[00:28:57] SPEAKER_00: choice I was making though something wrong with them.
[00:29:00] SPEAKER_00: Like they were leading a lesser life if they chose to live a more subdued you know work
[00:29:05] SPEAKER_00: eight hours a day.
[00:29:07] SPEAKER_00: It's just part of your life and spend a lot more time doing leisure activities.
[00:29:11] SPEAKER_00: And then I've come to realize that like you're you for reasons good and bad.
[00:29:15] SPEAKER_00: I'm sure some of his you know, jettic and some of its trauma or whatever else it is shaped
[00:29:19] SPEAKER_00: you just like to think for me.
[00:29:22] SPEAKER_00: And therefore that's how we need to act.
[00:29:25] SPEAKER_00: But ultimately if someone else can have fulfillment and contentment with half of the effort because
[00:29:30] SPEAKER_00: that's better for them like that's fine.
[00:29:33] SPEAKER_00: But it took me much later in life to have the wisdom to understand that.
[00:29:37] SPEAKER_00: Whereas everything you just said was basically almost an acknowledgement of like, hey this
[00:29:44] SPEAKER_00: is what I choose.
[00:29:45] SPEAKER_00: It's right for me.
[00:29:46] SPEAKER_00: But there's no judgment on someone who chooses something else.
[00:29:50] SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
[00:29:51] SPEAKER_00: So you should feel pretty good because it definitely took me like several decades to get
[00:29:54] SPEAKER_00: to where you are.
[00:29:56] SPEAKER_02: Sometimes I feel good.
[00:29:57] SPEAKER_02: Sometimes I need to go to the spa and get a massage.
[00:30:01] SPEAKER_02: This will be a shift into investing.
[00:30:03] SPEAKER_02: Because I think this does package itself well into how you chose to lead task ventures
[00:30:09] SPEAKER_02: and how you're now going into services for equity.
[00:30:12] SPEAKER_02: So can you talk about that shift?
[00:30:14] SPEAKER_00: Sure.
[00:30:15] SPEAKER_00: So unlike most people you talk to, like I didn't start off in business or technology.
[00:30:21] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[00:30:22] SPEAKER_00: I worked in politics and government for years and years and years.
[00:30:25] SPEAKER_00: You know, I made government salaries or campaigns salaries for years and years.
[00:30:30] SPEAKER_00: And then I kind of found the tech totally by accident.
[00:30:32] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[00:30:33] SPEAKER_00: So my last like real job was in 2009.
[00:30:37] SPEAKER_00: I was my Bloomberg campaign manager and ran for mayor of New York City.
[00:30:41] SPEAKER_00: We won.
[00:30:42] SPEAKER_00: And I decided that I thought there was sort of in the kind of political consulting business,
[00:30:47] SPEAKER_00: a hole in the model where typically people did one of two things.
[00:30:52] SPEAKER_00: Either they ran comprehensive campaigns for companies or institutions or candidates
[00:30:58] SPEAKER_00: wherever it was, but in one place or they would work nationally, but they would offer
[00:31:03] SPEAKER_00: one skill set.
[00:31:04] SPEAKER_00: They were a pollster.
[00:31:05] SPEAKER_00: They made ads, whatever it was.
[00:31:07] SPEAKER_00: And my view was that the world had changed enough that the way to get things done in government
[00:31:12] SPEAKER_00: and politics was no longer like a guy knows a guy and you know, the right guy.
[00:31:17] SPEAKER_00: It's really multifaceted.
[00:31:18] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[00:31:19] SPEAKER_00: So yes, it's the inside game of lobbying, but it is also earn media and pay media and social
[00:31:24] SPEAKER_00: media and grassroots and all these other tools.
[00:31:26] SPEAKER_00: And I felt like the amalgamation experiences I had had both in terms of the things I've
[00:31:31] SPEAKER_00: done and different places that I've lived and worked said to me, I think someone could
[00:31:36] SPEAKER_00: do everything everywhere.
[00:31:38] SPEAKER_00: And that was sort of the genesis of my first company, test strategies, which I don't
[00:31:42] SPEAKER_00: run any more, but still it's a little consulting firm.
[00:31:46] SPEAKER_00: And so about a year into that, I'm sitting in a Walmart meeting and a friend of mine called
[00:31:50] SPEAKER_00: and said, Hey, there's a guy with a small transportation startup.
[00:31:53] SPEAKER_00: He's having some regulatory problems.
[00:31:55] SPEAKER_00: Would you mind talking to him?
[00:31:57] SPEAKER_00: I become Uber's first political advisor that day.
[00:31:59] SPEAKER_00: I get really lucky when Travis calls back and says, listen, I can't afford your fee.
[00:32:04] SPEAKER_00: I'm going to take equity and thank God I said yes.
[00:32:08] SPEAKER_00: And I became very lucrative for a lot of other stuff that I do today.
[00:32:13] SPEAKER_00: But the experience that I had was effectively running campaigns all over the US to legalize
[00:32:19] SPEAKER_00: ride sharing and what we figured out that was really both transformative for Uber, but
[00:32:24] SPEAKER_00: really informed a lot of the investing up there ever since is in certain cases, you can
[00:32:31] SPEAKER_00: turn your customers into political advocates.
[00:32:33] SPEAKER_00: And you can use the very technology that they engage them on for business politically.
[00:32:39] SPEAKER_00: So for Uber, the taxi industry was a very, very big, it's hard for someone your age
[00:32:46] SPEAKER_00: not to sort of imagine this, but like was this incredibly powerful industry, right?
[00:32:51] SPEAKER_00: And we were a tiny, tiny seed series, a startup, right?
[00:32:57] SPEAKER_00: And Travis, you know, is a genius and has transformed society, but he didn't have this great
[00:33:03] SPEAKER_00: track record.
[00:33:04] SPEAKER_00: He had a couple of failed startups before that.
[00:33:06] SPEAKER_00: It wasn't like someone had like, what's an Elon Musk doing his next company, right?
[00:33:10] SPEAKER_00: And but the experience of taxi was so bad for so many people and Travis figured out
[00:33:18] SPEAKER_00: a way to do it.
[00:33:19] SPEAKER_00: That was so fundamentally better that he had this belief.
[00:33:22] SPEAKER_00: And he was right that ultimately people would fight to keep that opportunity.
[00:33:28] SPEAKER_00: And as taxi would then use their lobbyists and their political muscle, try to put his
[00:33:32] SPEAKER_00: data business, which they tried to do in every single market in America.
[00:33:37] We saved ourselves by going to our customers and saying, look, if you like this Uber thing,
[00:33:42] SPEAKER_00: we need you to let people know and we built functionality directly into the app that
[00:33:46] SPEAKER_00: let people tell their city councilman, their state center, whoever the relevant person
[00:33:50] SPEAKER_00: was, leave this thing alone.
[00:33:52] SPEAKER_00: I like it.
[00:33:53] SPEAKER_00: And so many people did that ultimately became more powerful than the donations and lobbyists
[00:33:57] SPEAKER_00: tax you had.
[00:33:59] SPEAKER_00: And we want.
[00:34:01] And so as that's all emerging, I'm like, okay, this equity thing, I remember literally
[00:34:06] SPEAKER_00: the first time, but I took the equity mainly just because like I like Travis, that was interesting
[00:34:10] SPEAKER_00: and I kind of wanted to work on it.
[00:34:12] SPEAKER_00: That was it.
[00:34:13] SPEAKER_00: I literally didn't even know what the phrase equity meant from that from a business context.
[00:34:15] SPEAKER_00: When I said yes.
[00:34:16] SPEAKER_00: And I remember one day, it was like one, it was nighttime.
[00:34:21] SPEAKER_00: We were on the phone about some issue regulatory issue somewhere.
[00:34:24] SPEAKER_00: And he said, I'm like, how many shares do you have?
[00:34:25] SPEAKER_00: Like, I mean, no.
[00:34:26] SPEAKER_00: And then like he helped me figure out how many I had.
[00:34:28] SPEAKER_00: And he said, oh, we just close around.
[00:34:32] SPEAKER_00: Your shares worth $12 million.
[00:34:34] SPEAKER_00: I was fucking, I mean, sometimes you remember like literally exactly where you were and
[00:34:38] SPEAKER_00: what you, like I remember where I was in my apartment, what I was looking at because
[00:34:43] SPEAKER_00: I was floored because I'm a first generation American.
[00:34:46] SPEAKER_00: I didn't grumble that much money.
[00:34:47] SPEAKER_00: I worked in government for years.
[00:34:49] SPEAKER_00: I mean, after law school, I turned down all these jobs at law firms offering a 150 grand
[00:34:54] SPEAKER_00: or whatever it was at the time to make $28,000 with the public department of New York City.
[00:34:59] SPEAKER_00: Right.
[00:35:00] SPEAKER_00: So like to me, money wasn't like a thing.
[00:35:02] SPEAKER_00: And it's not that I didn't want it.
[00:35:03] SPEAKER_00: It just didn't, I didn't really understand why I was money needed.
[00:35:07] SPEAKER_00: It never had literally occurred to me that I would ever have 12 million dollars.
[00:35:11] SPEAKER_00: Like it just had never once crossed my mind.
[00:35:13] SPEAKER_00: I remember me so fucking blown away by that.
[00:35:16] SPEAKER_00: I was like, oh my God.
[00:35:18] So this equity for services thing is pretty good.
[00:35:22] SPEAKER_00: So I did it again with clear to get them to airports and it worked out really well, not
[00:35:27] SPEAKER_00: anywhere near Uber well, but it was really good.
[00:35:31] And then I made, I wouldn't call it a mistake because it made a lot of money.
[00:35:35] SPEAKER_00: It was a good learning experience.
[00:35:36] SPEAKER_00: But I made this sort of view of like, oh, well, the really rich people have funds.
[00:35:40] SPEAKER_00: So I should have a fund.
[00:35:42] SPEAKER_00: And so I went out and raised my first venture fund started in rage in 2015, which
[00:35:47] SPEAKER_00: were making our first investments in late 2016.
[00:35:49] SPEAKER_00: Fandals are first investment.
[00:35:52] SPEAKER_00: And my thesis was, look, there's no fund out there that is regulatory first.
[00:35:58] SPEAKER_00: And so many startups have regulatory issues and Uber in some ways was sort of the perfect
[00:36:02] SPEAKER_00: example that I got in credit for being the person that did it.
[00:36:07] SPEAKER_00: But I can find more of these and I can invest in them and they'll want me to invest because
[00:36:13] SPEAKER_00: they're going to want my help from a political standpoint and will make a lot of money.
[00:36:17] SPEAKER_00: And so we did.
[00:36:18] SPEAKER_00: So we did three funds.
[00:36:20] SPEAKER_00: Fun one was so hard to do, but we raised it.
[00:36:23] SPEAKER_00: Finally, it was $35 million, but it's sitting at like about a five X right now.
[00:36:28] SPEAKER_00: We'll see where we're in circles.
[00:36:29] SPEAKER_00: We'll see where circle exits in a few weeks when the lockups done, but really well.
[00:36:36] SPEAKER_00: The fund two was 70 million, fund three was 140 and the funds have done incredibly well.
[00:36:43] SPEAKER_00: But as we were about to start closing the first round, the circle and the sum docs were
[00:36:48] SPEAKER_00: fund four, it kind of hit me that like it was the wrong business model because what I
[00:36:55] SPEAKER_00: realized was founders who took our investment did so not because they needed my money, but
[00:37:00] SPEAKER_00: because they wanted our help politically.
[00:37:03] SPEAKER_00: But ultimately, I started talking to them like let's say I just asked you what I did
[00:37:07] SPEAKER_00: with Travis just hey, just give me equity.
[00:37:09] SPEAKER_00: I don't, but I'm not going to give you a chat.
[00:37:11] SPEAKER_00: Like yeah, we don't care.
[00:37:12] SPEAKER_00: Finally, we didn't need your money.
[00:37:13] SPEAKER_00: It's like any really great start to get into it, but it doesn't need your money in the
[00:37:16] SPEAKER_00: first place, right?
[00:37:17] SPEAKER_00: Anyone who desperately needs your money, there might be a reason why.
[00:37:20] SPEAKER_00: I mean, occasionally there's a diamond in the rough that no one believed in.
[00:37:23] SPEAKER_00: They put generally speaking, that's not the case.
[00:37:26] SPEAKER_00: And I was like, why am I giving 80% of my profits back to my LPs, right?
[00:37:32] SPEAKER_00: I don't actually need them be.
[00:37:34] SPEAKER_00: I have a great partner named Jordan off who is a brilliant brilliant investor, but he's
[00:37:39] SPEAKER_00: a traditional venture capitalist and we split the equity in the carry and everything else,
[00:37:43] SPEAKER_00: which was reasonable, but I didn't really need all that stuff.
[00:37:46] SPEAKER_00: I didn't need to worry about portfolio construction.
[00:37:48] SPEAKER_00: I didn't need to worry about fund administration.
[00:37:50] SPEAKER_00: I didn't to worry about compliance.
[00:37:52] SPEAKER_00: I didn't need to deal with taking board seats.
[00:37:56] SPEAKER_00: And so I pulled the plug.
[00:37:57] SPEAKER_00: I said, we're not going to raise fund four.
[00:38:00] SPEAKER_00: And I'm going to do a hybrid of the first two models.
[00:38:02] SPEAKER_00: So I announced this back in February, I think, of 25.
[00:38:06] SPEAKER_00: And it's equity for services, so what I did with Uber and with Clear, but now also ProRata.
[00:38:12] SPEAKER_00: And then as our investor rights come up, I'll either invest off my own balance sheet.
[00:38:17] SPEAKER_00: So there are companies since that I've said, you know what, I love this company.
[00:38:21] SPEAKER_00: And it's, you know, an amount of money that I can afford to deploy at my own capital
[00:38:25] SPEAKER_00: and I'll do so.
[00:38:26] SPEAKER_00: Or I have all these investors that made a lot of money with us.
[00:38:30] SPEAKER_00: And I'll just go to them and say, hey, here's a company that I really like the round
[00:38:33] SPEAKER_00: is bigger than I can take myself.
[00:38:34] SPEAKER_00: Do you want a partner and do SPVs?
[00:38:38] SPEAKER_00: And for me, from a financial and kind of time standpoint, it's better because one, I own
[00:38:45] 100% of the risk, but I also want 100% of the upside.
[00:38:47] SPEAKER_00: Now I do every year now because I have a team of people who work at the company to both
[00:38:54] SPEAKER_00: source fields and then more importantly, help over a portfolio company, solve their regulatory
[00:38:57] SPEAKER_00: problems.
[00:38:58] SPEAKER_00: I have to pay those people every two weeks with a little equity event or not, right?
[00:39:02] SPEAKER_00: So it costs me a couple of million dollars a year on the front end.
[00:39:06] But I then also own, I mean, I gave them employees by 20, 25% of it, I own all of the
[00:39:12] SPEAKER_00: rest.
[00:39:13] SPEAKER_00: And that's a lot greater ultimately than the carry that I had at my fund in terms of
[00:39:19] SPEAKER_00: of upside leverage.
[00:39:21] SPEAKER_00: And they be, I don't see what fundraising anymore.
[00:39:23] SPEAKER_00: It's a pain in the ass.
[00:39:24] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[00:39:25] SPEAKER_00: It's a huge pain in the ass.
[00:39:26] SPEAKER_00: And the reality is, I'm not good at it.
[00:39:30] SPEAKER_00: And a lot of the things that have allowed me to succeed professionally are the same things
[00:39:35] SPEAKER_00: that were hindrances for me for fundraising in that, like, I'm a missfin.
[00:39:40] SPEAKER_00: Right?
[00:39:41] SPEAKER_00: Like, I don't fit in well.
[00:39:43] SPEAKER_00: I wasn't popular when I was a kid.
[00:39:47] SPEAKER_00: I, you know, like, I'm not comfortable, like, in big social settings.
[00:39:51] SPEAKER_00: Like, I like my friends and I like to work, but like, I don't go to, like, you probably
[00:39:56] SPEAKER_00: have to go to all these like networking things.
[00:39:59] SPEAKER_00: Like, I don't go to fucking any of that, right?
[00:40:01] SPEAKER_00: Even like, conferences show up.
[00:40:05] SPEAKER_00: Someone meets me.
[00:40:06] SPEAKER_00: They put me in the green room.
[00:40:07] SPEAKER_00: I have a cup of coffee.
[00:40:08] SPEAKER_00: They might meet, I go speak.
[00:40:09] SPEAKER_00: I take a few pictures with people and then I'm out at the side door, right?
[00:40:12] SPEAKER_00: Like, I don't want to socialize.
[00:40:15] SPEAKER_00: Even like the other day I was in San Francisco and did an event for tech week.
[00:40:19] SPEAKER_00: I was very happy to do the event.
[00:40:21] The 30 people that came out to me afterward and I had to like hear every one of their
[00:40:25] SPEAKER_00: pitches and everything else like, oh my God.
[00:40:27] Like, there are people who feed off of that.
[00:40:29] SPEAKER_00: That's not me, right?
[00:40:30] SPEAKER_00: So as a result, I was not a good institutional fundraiser because I don't play golf and I
[00:40:36] SPEAKER_00: don't like hang out in a country club or any of that kind of stuff.
[00:40:39] SPEAKER_00: And like, yeah, I go to lots of mess and next games, but I don't take clients.
[00:40:43] SPEAKER_00: I take my friends.
[00:40:44] SPEAKER_00: I don't like kids.
[00:40:45] SPEAKER_00: And so, and also what it turns out that institutional investors want to hear, they think they want
[00:40:54] SPEAKER_00: a different, they say they want, they think they want a differentiated strategy.
[00:40:57] SPEAKER_00: They don't.
[00:40:58] SPEAKER_00: What they want is this is exactly what you already know how to come full with with this tiny
[00:41:04] SPEAKER_00: twist that could deliver some alpha, but at the same time isn't too risky, right?
[00:41:09] SPEAKER_00: And like, it took me years to be able to understand that.
[00:41:11] SPEAKER_00: And then even when I knew how to say the right things, like it wasn't genuine, right?
[00:41:16] SPEAKER_00: And so I think people can feel that.
[00:41:17] SPEAKER_00: So I don't have to fundraise anymore.
[00:41:19] SPEAKER_00: I don't have to manage LP relationships anymore.
[00:41:22] SPEAKER_00: I hate sitting on boards because I don't add any value.
[00:41:25] SPEAKER_00: I am only good at one thing solving your regulatory problems, right?
[00:41:30] SPEAKER_00: Or creating regulatory opportunity or arbitrage.
[00:41:33] SPEAKER_00: And I'm going to do that anyway because I'm an investor in the company.
[00:41:38] SPEAKER_00: He's sitting on the board and hearing about the CAQ or hearing about the burn or the
[00:41:43] SPEAKER_00: next race, like, I don't fucking care.
[00:41:45] SPEAKER_00: And I don't add any value to that conversation, right?
[00:41:48] SPEAKER_00: So, but when we were investors, we're taking lead positions.
[00:41:51] SPEAKER_00: We took board seats, right?
[00:41:52] SPEAKER_00: So I had to sit on boards.
[00:41:53] SPEAKER_00: Like, I don't have a couple that I'm left on, but I don't do that anymore.
[00:41:57] SPEAKER_00: Portfolio, construction, all that shit.
[00:41:58] SPEAKER_00: Like, I don't have many that anymore.
[00:42:00] SPEAKER_00: And I own all the economic upsides.
[00:42:03] SPEAKER_00: You put all that together.
[00:42:04] SPEAKER_00: So for me, this is a much better model.
[00:42:07] SPEAKER_00: And I would say for the people listening to this, look, most people in order to gain access
[00:42:12] SPEAKER_00: to highly disruptive, highly promising startups have to write a check to get equity because
[00:42:17] SPEAKER_00: that's how the model works.
[00:42:19] SPEAKER_00: But if you have a particular skill set, so there are lawyers that can do this, there are
[00:42:22] SPEAKER_00: marketing people that can do this.
[00:42:24] SPEAKER_00: You could do this with media, right?
[00:42:26] SPEAKER_00: Where you're like, hey, I have this thing you really need.
[00:42:30] I believe in you.
[00:42:31] SPEAKER_00: And I'm going to bet on you, right?
[00:42:32] SPEAKER_00: I'm not asking you for cash.
[00:42:33] SPEAKER_00: I'm just betting on the upside that you're going to succeed.
[00:42:35] SPEAKER_00: Give me equity.
[00:42:37] SPEAKER_00: You can make that sale.
[00:42:39] SPEAKER_00: And if you can make that sale, it is a much better model.
[00:42:43] Is that answer your question?
[00:42:45] That does.
[00:42:46] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[00:42:47] SPEAKER_02: Did I just change your world view on what your career is going to go?
[00:42:49] SPEAKER_00: No, I mean, I've been getting some advisory shares from people.
[00:42:52] SPEAKER_02: They offer it to me, which is amazing.
[00:42:54] SPEAKER_02: Were you ever thinking of raising a fund?
[00:42:57] SPEAKER_02: Similar to you, like, I know what it takes to raise a fund.
[00:43:00] SPEAKER_02: I've worked at a couple of emerging managers, emerging
[00:43:02] SPEAKER_02: partners and funds.
[00:43:04] SPEAKER_02: I don't like that.
[00:43:05] SPEAKER_02: That is like adding another job on top of the job.
[00:43:08] SPEAKER_02: And it clouds your judgment.
[00:43:10] SPEAKER_02: And it makes you orient the practice and everything that you
[00:43:13] SPEAKER_02: probably find is like, you're superpowers
[00:43:15] SPEAKER_02: and what you enjoy out of investing.
[00:43:16] SPEAKER_02: And it like, you have to like come in with the mindset
[00:43:19] SPEAKER_02: of knowing that it is like a multi-dimensional practice.
[00:43:23] SPEAKER_02: And that is just one component of it.
[00:43:25] SPEAKER_02: But it is a very large component.
[00:43:26] SPEAKER_02: And you always have to be fundraising.
[00:43:28] SPEAKER_02: You always have to be like networking with LPs
[00:43:30] SPEAKER_02: when you're on the road meeting founders.
[00:43:32] SPEAKER_02: Because it's like a cycle that just continues.
[00:43:34] SPEAKER_02: So like in the beginning, like, there are so many people
[00:43:37] SPEAKER_02: that have reached out to me about starting a fund
[00:43:40] SPEAKER_02: or like having me as like a coGP, like something like that.
[00:43:43] SPEAKER_02: And I just like, I'm focused on this.
[00:43:46] SPEAKER_02: Like, I need the power law for this to win.
[00:43:48] SPEAKER_02: And then maybe other stuff will come across.
[00:43:50] SPEAKER_02: But like, it is, it would be a huge distraction.
[00:43:53] SPEAKER_02: And even then, if you get to that point,
[00:43:56] SPEAKER_00: I would still say having now done both the advisory share
[00:44:02] SPEAKER_00: model, ideally, you get to a place
[00:44:04] SPEAKER_00: like where I've been, where I can then either have the capital
[00:44:06] SPEAKER_00: or raise the capital to sort of continue on.
[00:44:10] SPEAKER_00: It's just much better.
[00:44:12] SPEAKER_00: I don't even really think it's it.
[00:44:14] SPEAKER_00: Now, here's where that's not true.
[00:44:17] SPEAKER_00: For the same reason, not a great fund raiser.
[00:44:18] SPEAKER_00: You know, my biggest fund was 140.
[00:44:20] SPEAKER_00: And fund four would have been roughly the same size.
[00:44:23] SPEAKER_00: If you can raise billions and billions of billions of dollars
[00:44:26] SPEAKER_00: and effectively your business model is your management fees
[00:44:29] SPEAKER_00: and not the carry.
[00:44:31] SPEAKER_01: And a lot of people raise mega funds.
[00:44:34] SPEAKER_00: Their superpower isn't investing.
[00:44:36] SPEAKER_00: It's raising institutional capital, right?
[00:44:39] SPEAKER_00: If that's your superpower, then yes,
[00:44:42] SPEAKER_00: then that's the right approach.
[00:44:43] SPEAKER_00: Because if you have $10 billion under management,
[00:44:46] SPEAKER_00: you're getting $150 to $250 million
[00:44:49] SPEAKER_00: your management fees and you normally business doesn't cost
[00:44:52] SPEAKER_00: nearly that much to runs.
[00:44:53] SPEAKER_00: You're pocketing the rest like, sure, that's great.
[00:44:56] SPEAKER_00: For as long as you keep raising the money.
[00:44:58] SPEAKER_00: But if you're not in that position,
[00:45:01] SPEAKER_00: it seems to me that if you have the opportunity
[00:45:04] SPEAKER_00: to do equity for services,
[00:45:05] SPEAKER_00: it is just unquestionably a far better approach.
[00:45:09] Yeah, it's it's interesting.
[00:45:11] SPEAKER_02: Carter had just put out their recent VC fund performance
[00:45:15] SPEAKER_02: report.
[00:45:16] SPEAKER_02: And so you're seeing this in the data of like the VC market
[00:45:18] SPEAKER_02: itself.
[00:45:19] SPEAKER_02: There is a huge bivirication in this,
[00:45:22] SPEAKER_02: barbell effect that Mark Andreessen talks about too.
[00:45:24] SPEAKER_02: It's like there's like the always going to be like the small
[00:45:27] SPEAKER_02: emerging class of managers.
[00:45:28] SPEAKER_02: It's healthy.
[00:45:28] SPEAKER_02: It's doing well.
[00:45:29] SPEAKER_02: There's like this huge gap in the middle of like medium
[00:45:33] SPEAKER_02: sized managers and then like the large,
[00:45:36] SPEAKER_02: the large funds just keep compounding because they've got
[00:45:38] SPEAKER_02: the super power law dynamics within them.
[00:45:41] SPEAKER_02: Totally, right.
[00:45:42] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's right.
[00:45:42] SPEAKER_00: So I think the question is if you are an emerging manager,
[00:45:47] SPEAKER_00: and let's say you don't have the thing that you or I could do
[00:45:49] SPEAKER_00: where you could just get the equity else wise,
[00:45:52] SPEAKER_00: if you can run your fund at say sub 50,
[00:45:55] SPEAKER_00: my advice is to do that, right?
[00:45:57] SPEAKER_00: Because the challenges,
[00:45:59] SPEAKER_00: sort of like when we went to one from 35 to 140,
[00:46:02] SPEAKER_00: the upside was, we had more management fees.
[00:46:05] SPEAKER_00: It made life easier.
[00:46:06] SPEAKER_00: It was a little less of a scramble, right?
[00:46:09] SPEAKER_00: But at the same time, we still have that are basically
[00:46:12] SPEAKER_00: spending all the major fees on the operations of the fund.
[00:46:14] SPEAKER_00: It wasn't like we were taking home lots of cash
[00:46:17] SPEAKER_00: at the end of the day, but now the hurdle
[00:46:19] SPEAKER_00: was 140.
[00:46:20] SPEAKER_00: So for fun,
[00:46:21] SPEAKER_00: one, we were the money so fast because the hurdle was 35.
[00:46:26] SPEAKER_00: And some of that was like SPV.
[00:46:28] SPEAKER_00: So the actual hurdle was like 22 or something.
[00:46:30] SPEAKER_00: And we got there quickly and we were in carry
[00:46:32] SPEAKER_00: and then we were in super,
[00:46:33] SPEAKER_00: we got like a trigger to get 25% like all of that really quickly.
[00:46:37] SPEAKER_00: We're the fund three.
[00:46:39] SPEAKER_00: The investors are based on just me looking at the fund.
[00:46:42] SPEAKER_00: If the investors are going to make money,
[00:46:44] SPEAKER_00: like it's going to work out for them,
[00:46:46] SPEAKER_00: but I don't know how much carry I'm going to make.
[00:46:49] SPEAKER_00: And I also didn't make that much of the man fees.
[00:46:51] SPEAKER_00: And so 140 is like the worst possible size, right?
[00:46:54] SPEAKER_00: If you can do sub 50, get a couple of great hits
[00:46:58] SPEAKER_00: and really ride those great.
[00:46:59] SPEAKER_00: If you could do billions of dollars
[00:47:01] SPEAKER_00: and make a ton of money in the after a fees, great.
[00:47:03] But that in between number, like at least for me,
[00:47:06] SPEAKER_00: it didn't make sense.
[00:47:07] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it doesn't make sense.
[00:47:09] SPEAKER_02: It's interesting because I don't think like many people
[00:47:11] SPEAKER_02: think about VC and it's like a very sexy,
[00:47:13] SPEAKER_02: it's attractive industry,
[00:47:14] SPEAKER_02: but they don't understand the actual dynamics
[00:47:17] SPEAKER_02: of structuring it out.
[00:47:18] SPEAKER_02: You're actually probably not going to take in that much money.
[00:47:21] SPEAKER_02: And most managers are poor for a very long time.
[00:47:23] SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And even like, it's funny,
[00:47:25] SPEAKER_00: there's this sort of view of like,
[00:47:27] SPEAKER_00: well, if you're early stage,
[00:47:28] SPEAKER_00: as long as you have a couple of home runs,
[00:47:30] SPEAKER_00: you're in great shape.
[00:47:32] Even that's, so that's true if it's a $35 million fund.
[00:47:36] SPEAKER_00: But my second fund is $70 million.
[00:47:39] SPEAKER_00: You know, it's sitting at a three and a half X right now,
[00:47:44] SPEAKER_00: but has no DPI, a couple of minor secondary things,
[00:47:47] SPEAKER_00: but no real DPI yet.
[00:47:49] SPEAKER_00: Again, the investors are going to do really well.
[00:47:52] SPEAKER_00: I don't know that we're going to do that well on it, right?
[00:47:55] SPEAKER_00: Because you got to return the 70 and the management fees
[00:47:58] SPEAKER_00: and then, you know, we'll make money,
[00:48:01] SPEAKER_00: but the truth is you probably need like,
[00:48:03] SPEAKER_00: we have one absolute grand slam in that fund, right?
[00:48:07] SPEAKER_00: That we led the series A, like a 30 was all wrong,
[00:48:09] SPEAKER_00: which is a mental health startup that does kind of the back
[00:48:12] SPEAKER_00: off is, and I think we led the A at 32 and a half
[00:48:14] SPEAKER_00: and, you know, evaluation out to at least 50 X, right?
[00:48:19] But everything else is like,
[00:48:22] SPEAKER_00: there's a couple of pry five to 10 X's
[00:48:24] SPEAKER_00: and then a bunch of one X's or zeros.
[00:48:26] SPEAKER_00: It will work out well for the LPs.
[00:48:30] When I kind of look at over a 10 year period
[00:48:33] SPEAKER_00: between the management fees from that
[00:48:35] SPEAKER_00: and the carry, how much I'm going to make,
[00:48:37] SPEAKER_00: like again, not a great use of my time.
[00:48:40] SPEAKER_00: Like I still own my consulting firm,
[00:48:42] SPEAKER_00: I don't work there anymore, but I still own it.
[00:48:44] SPEAKER_00: And like I look at the profits of that generate
[00:48:46] SPEAKER_00: and that takes me a couple hours a week of management
[00:48:49] SPEAKER_00: and maybe some, some pitching.
[00:48:52] And then in comparison to that,
[00:48:53] SPEAKER_00: like a lot of the venture math isn't there at all.
[00:48:55] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the math isn't mapping.
[00:48:58] Yes.
[00:48:59] So there's that component of the macro
[00:49:02] SPEAKER_02: of the venture capital world right now
[00:49:03] SPEAKER_02: and then there's also the AI component,
[00:49:05] SPEAKER_02: which we talked about a little bit before.
[00:49:07] SPEAKER_02: But before we started recording,
[00:49:09] SPEAKER_02: we were talking about valuations
[00:49:11] SPEAKER_02: and how that's impacting whether you're an AI company
[00:49:13] SPEAKER_02: or a non-AI company.
[00:49:16] SPEAKER_02: There's also data in Carter that 30,
[00:49:18] SPEAKER_02: that series A companies get a 30% premium
[00:49:22] SPEAKER_02: on them compared to if they're AI versus non-AI.
[00:49:26] And I think it's probably more than that
[00:49:29] SPEAKER_02: because like, I mean, if you reduce it down to good companies,
[00:49:34] SPEAKER_02: the delta is going to be much, much greater.
[00:49:37] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, for sure.
[00:49:38] SPEAKER_00: I mean, look, we see this all the time,
[00:49:40] SPEAKER_00: which is there's a mess.
[00:49:43] SPEAKER_00: So when I started investing capital, such 2016,
[00:49:47] SPEAKER_00: we were in this sort of a golden era venture
[00:49:50] SPEAKER_00: where all that mattered was growth, right?
[00:49:52] SPEAKER_00: No one's like, oh, figure out the business model later.
[00:49:55] SPEAKER_00: We'll work out profitability later.
[00:49:57] SPEAKER_00: And that worked for a while.
[00:49:59] SPEAKER_00: Like we had some, you know,
[00:50:01] SPEAKER_00: Fandall and Coinbase,
[00:50:02] SPEAKER_00: whatever it was, some great successes out of that.
[00:50:04] SPEAKER_00: Some of them became really profitable companies,
[00:50:06] SPEAKER_00: some did not.
[00:50:07] SPEAKER_00: But fundamentally, it was ultimately bad economics.
[00:50:13] SPEAKER_00: It was a rational super-entering,
[00:50:15] SPEAKER_00: where everything was just sort of based
[00:50:16] SPEAKER_00: on this incredible fuzzism about the future.
[00:50:19] SPEAKER_00: And by the way, at least with AI,
[00:50:20] SPEAKER_00: there's like this concept of some sort of breakthrough
[00:50:23] SPEAKER_00: that we can't totally understand.
[00:50:24] SPEAKER_00: Like, back then there wasn't even really that, right?
[00:50:26] SPEAKER_00: A lot of the, like, that was like a market place.
[00:50:29] SPEAKER_00: It's not that complicated, right?
[00:50:30] SPEAKER_00: Like you, me and Lance could build a market place
[00:50:32] SPEAKER_00: this afternoon if we really wanted to, right?
[00:50:35] SPEAKER_00: So, and then the bottom fell out in like 21, right?
[00:50:40] SPEAKER_00: And then I was like, oh, right, this is a business.
[00:50:44] SPEAKER_00: We need to worry about you.
[00:50:45] SPEAKER_00: And economics, we need to worry about EBITDA.
[00:50:47] SPEAKER_00: We need to worry about CAC.
[00:50:49] SPEAKER_00: And like all these things are like, okay, fine, make sense.
[00:50:53] SPEAKER_00: Now we're in a world where we're living
[00:50:54] SPEAKER_00: in both realities at the same time.
[00:50:57] SPEAKER_00: So we want to say non-AI company,
[00:51:00] SPEAKER_00: the post kind of drop off mentality
[00:51:02] SPEAKER_00: still typically applies.
[00:51:03] SPEAKER_00: You really are looking at like the fundamentals
[00:51:05] SPEAKER_00: of the business itself.
[00:51:07] SPEAKER_00: And ultimately will P.B. greater than L
[00:51:09] SPEAKER_00: and will P.B. so much greater than L
[00:51:11] SPEAKER_00: that this has become a really valuable company, right?
[00:51:14] SPEAKER_00: When it comes to AI, we're back to this like,
[00:51:16] SPEAKER_00: oh, would the law just kind of work out, right?
[00:51:18] SPEAKER_00: Well, I was telling you about a company.
[00:51:19] SPEAKER_00: I won't name the company or the firm that won the deal.
[00:51:23] SPEAKER_00: But it was a deep fake prevention space.
[00:51:26] SPEAKER_00: They had about a million dollars in ARR.
[00:51:28] SPEAKER_00: And I offered three and a half on 35,
[00:51:31] SPEAKER_00: which I actually thought was kind of generous, right?
[00:51:34] SPEAKER_00: The winning bid was 14 on 140.
[00:51:38] SPEAKER_00: I have no idea how that investor is going to make
[00:51:44] SPEAKER_00: back their money on that deal.
[00:51:46] SPEAKER_00: If you want to employ now coming in at the ARB on at 140,
[00:51:50] SPEAKER_00: I'm not really sure how much.
[00:51:51] SPEAKER_00: Like if someone can't just try to work at this company,
[00:51:54] SPEAKER_00: I'd probably think, if your only goal
[00:51:55] SPEAKER_00: is to maximize the upside of the equity,
[00:51:57] SPEAKER_00: like probably not, right?
[00:51:59] SPEAKER_00: And yet, because it was just AI,
[00:52:04] SPEAKER_00: somehow all normal rules went out the window, right?
[00:52:08] SPEAKER_00: And so for us, you know,
[00:52:10] like the other day, I saw a company in the mental health chat
[00:52:14] SPEAKER_00: bot space that was heavily regulated.
[00:52:16] SPEAKER_00: Definitely could use our help.
[00:52:18] SPEAKER_00: Has an insanely high valuation.
[00:52:21] SPEAKER_00: Maybe it'll grow into it, maybe it worth it,
[00:52:23] SPEAKER_00: maybe it won't.
[00:52:23] SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
[00:52:24] SPEAKER_00: But ultimately realize it's from an equity
[00:52:26] SPEAKER_00: or service standpoint, like it makes sense for me
[00:52:28] SPEAKER_00: because there's no point in me taking the bet on a company
[00:52:31] SPEAKER_00: that could, the million reasons why it could still fail.
[00:52:34] SPEAKER_00: But hope that it'll be a five or a 10 or a 20 X.
[00:52:38] SPEAKER_00: If the starting point is so incredibly high
[00:52:40] SPEAKER_00: that I just don't see any world,
[00:52:42] SPEAKER_00: if you just look at the market where this could possibly be
[00:52:44] SPEAKER_00: the case, it's kind of like I didn't do any cannabis deals.
[00:52:47] SPEAKER_00: And the reason I didn't do any cannabis deals
[00:52:49] SPEAKER_00: was not more wrong.
[00:52:50] SPEAKER_00: So I just, it was just that when I looked at the valuation
[00:52:53] SPEAKER_00: of the deals that I was seeing,
[00:52:55] SPEAKER_00: and I looked at the comps on the Canadian market,
[00:52:58] SPEAKER_00: which does allow cannabis trading,
[00:53:01] SPEAKER_00: it was like, I don't really understand
[00:53:02] SPEAKER_00: why these American private companies
[00:53:04] SPEAKER_00: are so highly valued because when they're eventually
[00:53:07] SPEAKER_00: as an liquidity, if you look at the market that
[00:53:09] SPEAKER_00: and cannabis capital is country, right?
[00:53:12] SPEAKER_00: That has trading, yeah.
[00:53:13] SPEAKER_00: The multiples are nearly what you would need
[00:53:16] SPEAKER_00: to be a succeed.
[00:53:16] SPEAKER_00: And so other than some equity for services with ease,
[00:53:20] SPEAKER_00: like we never did any deployment of capital into cannabis,
[00:53:24] SPEAKER_00: simply because it just didn't make sense to me
[00:53:26] SPEAKER_00: from an economic standpoint.
[00:53:27] SPEAKER_00: And by the way, one or two maybe have disproved up
[00:53:31] SPEAKER_00: but not many, right?
[00:53:32] SPEAKER_00: Like I don't really regret that decision at all.
[00:53:35] SPEAKER_00: I'm not saying AI is cannabis.
[00:53:36] SPEAKER_00: AI obviously has a hell of a lot more potential than cannabis,
[00:53:39] SPEAKER_00: but I kind of still am applying the mentality to it.
[00:53:45] SPEAKER_00: So a lot of the deals that I'm doing are in AI,
[00:53:48] SPEAKER_00: but they're all really companies where the series A
[00:53:52] SPEAKER_00: is still sub $100 million, right?
[00:53:56] SPEAKER_00: Or right at $100 million, which is still kind of high,
[00:53:59] SPEAKER_00: but nonetheless, not totally insane.
[00:54:02] SPEAKER_00: And if there are companies where it's well north of that,
[00:54:06] SPEAKER_00: I'm just like, you know, it might be,
[00:54:08] SPEAKER_00: maybe I'll regret this, maybe it'll be a great company.
[00:54:11] SPEAKER_00: If you really want a regulatory help,
[00:54:13] SPEAKER_00: I have a consulting firm that will gladly take your money,
[00:54:15] SPEAKER_00: you know, but I'm not taking that away.
[00:54:18] SPEAKER_00: There's something about regulation that I find really curious
[00:54:23] SPEAKER_02: and I think it's become more apparent this year,
[00:54:25] SPEAKER_02: particularly with the new administration
[00:54:27] SPEAKER_02: and all their efforts and advancing different sectors.
[00:54:30] SPEAKER_02: Like we talked about nuclear, like we talked about AI,
[00:54:33] SPEAKER_02: like there are so many different areas
[00:54:35] SPEAKER_02: where you're getting the connection between Silicon Valley
[00:54:40] SPEAKER_02: and DC that it seems pretty amicable
[00:54:43] SPEAKER_02: and it seems like it's actually progressing growth.
[00:54:46] SPEAKER_00: So that's a really good question.
[00:54:48] SPEAKER_00: I don't agree.
[00:54:49] You don't?
[00:54:50] SPEAKER_00: No.
[00:54:50] SPEAKER_00: I would say that there is a narrative that supports
[00:54:54] SPEAKER_00: what you're talking about and reporters really like that narrative.
[00:55:00] SPEAKER_00: Okay.
[00:55:01] SPEAKER_00: And there are half a dozen people,
[00:55:03] SPEAKER_00: Mark and Treeson, David Tax, Chimath,
[00:55:05] SPEAKER_00: others who are big Trump supporters, Peter Tio, Elon and away.
[00:55:11] SPEAKER_00: And they've done really well, right?
[00:55:12] SPEAKER_00: It has, you know, they've invested in a person
[00:55:16] SPEAKER_00: that who has zero sum mentality to the world.
[00:55:19] SPEAKER_00: And in that person's worldview,
[00:55:20] SPEAKER_00: if you are helpful to them, you can really do well along the way.
[00:55:25] SPEAKER_00: Like look at all the people who are investing
[00:55:26] SPEAKER_00: in tech talk at a 14 billion dollar evaluation, right?
[00:55:29] SPEAKER_00: That's if you're wearing it or, you know,
[00:55:31] SPEAKER_00: else or whoever it is, like amazing, right?
[00:55:34] But I would say that sort of individual companies
[00:55:39] SPEAKER_00: getting contracts or government favors,
[00:55:42] SPEAKER_00: but it's not the market, right?
[00:55:44] SPEAKER_00: So if you were China and you had the ability
[00:55:47] SPEAKER_00: to install an American and control an American president,
[00:55:50] SPEAKER_00: there's like an old movie called The Mentoring in Cantonese,
[00:55:52] SPEAKER_00: that's about that, that's Russia.
[00:55:56] SPEAKER_00: And you said, I really want to hurt America long term.
[00:55:59] SPEAKER_00: Here's what I would do.
[00:56:01] SPEAKER_00: I would go after what makes our economy great.
[00:56:04] SPEAKER_00: So what is that?
[00:56:05] SPEAKER_00: It is intellectual property.
[00:56:08] It is research and development.
[00:56:10] SPEAKER_00: It is higher education.
[00:56:12] SPEAKER_00: It is immigration because we can get the best
[00:56:15] SPEAKER_00: and the brightest from all over the world to want to come here
[00:56:18] SPEAKER_00: and then become part of our economy.
[00:56:20] SPEAKER_00: It is free trade.
[00:56:22] SPEAKER_00: It is independent, fed and independent, you know,
[00:56:26] SPEAKER_00: some were dependent BLS.
[00:56:29] SPEAKER_00: It is sort of, you know, an independent market, right?
[00:56:33] SPEAKER_00: So there are all these fundamentals.
[00:56:35] SPEAKER_00: Trump has undermined every single one of those things.
[00:56:39] SPEAKER_00: So I would argue everything that makes the American economy
[00:56:42] SPEAKER_00: great that venture capital totally relies upon
[00:56:44] SPEAKER_00: at the end of the day is being undermined significantly.
[00:56:48] SPEAKER_00: And so if you said to me,
[00:56:51] SPEAKER_00: are you as bullish about VC in 10 years
[00:56:53] SPEAKER_00: if the trends don't reverse?
[00:56:55] SPEAKER_00: Now we'll hopefully we'll have a new president
[00:56:57] SPEAKER_00: whoever it is in 2028 because hopefully
[00:56:59] SPEAKER_00: we won't have sort of martial law or whatever.
[00:57:03] And maybe that person, for me,
[00:57:04] SPEAKER_00: the party will reverse some of the policies.
[00:57:07] SPEAKER_00: But at this current rate,
[00:57:09] SPEAKER_00: I would say the American economy is far weaker
[00:57:13] SPEAKER_00: long term than it's ever been.
[00:57:16] SPEAKER_00: And I would be far less bullish on it.
[00:57:19] SPEAKER_00: So yeah, if you are, and by the way,
[00:57:23] SPEAKER_00: because of what I do for a living,
[00:57:24] SPEAKER_00: like do I know how to get a startup into DOD or HHS
[00:57:28] SPEAKER_00: or whatever it is, the FDA, like, yeah, you know,
[00:57:31] SPEAKER_00: there's a skill set that we have that,
[00:57:33] SPEAKER_00: you know, we figure out the right ways into things.
[00:57:35] SPEAKER_00: So it's not that we don't even take advantage of it,
[00:57:39] SPEAKER_00: we do, but from a long term Americans standpoint,
[00:57:45] SPEAKER_00: I actually think that we're gonna,
[00:57:46] SPEAKER_00: VC is a sector for those who participated in this
[00:57:51] SPEAKER_00: unless they just made so much money
[00:57:53] SPEAKER_00: and only just care about how much money they have
[00:57:55] SPEAKER_00: and nothing else are gonna really regret it.
[00:57:58] So I'm curious on your perspective on this part
[00:58:02] SPEAKER_02: in particular.
[00:58:03] The US has over $37 trillion in debt.
[00:58:06] SPEAKER_02: And so a lot of people are counting on AI
[00:58:10] SPEAKER_02: and the technological innovation that is going on
[00:58:14] SPEAKER_02: that's in these narratives to unlock that and offset it.
[00:58:17] SPEAKER_02: By creating economic prosperity.
[00:58:20] SPEAKER_02: Sure, look, by the way, again,
[00:58:22] SPEAKER_00: the title capitalist is literally in my job, right?
[00:58:26] SPEAKER_00: Venture capitalist.
[00:58:27] SPEAKER_00: I believe strongly in capitalism.
[00:58:28] SPEAKER_00: I would say everything that I just,
[00:58:31] SPEAKER_00: all those points I just made to you,
[00:58:33] are what capitalism is, right?
[00:58:35] SPEAKER_00: And what we're doing now, especially with the US government,
[00:58:37] SPEAKER_00: just taking 10% of intel or whatever,
[00:58:39] SPEAKER_00: that's socialism, not a socialist.
[00:58:42] SPEAKER_00: Like, yes, what you just said is right,
[00:58:44] SPEAKER_00: but that's based on fundamental capitalist principles
[00:58:48] SPEAKER_00: and theory of which we are not advancing right now.
[00:58:50] SPEAKER_00: So like if you take the big beautiful bill, for example,
[00:58:55] SPEAKER_00: we took on a couple of trillion dollars more in debt
[00:58:58] SPEAKER_00: and I'm not really sure what the upside is, right?
[00:59:02] SPEAKER_00: It might benefit me,
[00:59:04] SPEAKER_00: it's someone at the very top of the tax curve,
[00:59:07] SPEAKER_00: but what am I going to do with it?
[00:59:11] SPEAKER_00: Like, I'm not fundamentally people
[00:59:13] SPEAKER_00: at the bottom of the ladder spend a lot more money.
[00:59:16] SPEAKER_00: Like if you actually want to juice the economy,
[00:59:19] SPEAKER_00: you want to give tax cuts or benefits
[00:59:22] SPEAKER_00: to the lowest income people
[00:59:23] SPEAKER_00: because they're going to spend every penny of it, right?
[00:59:26] SPEAKER_00: You know, if I put it in treasuries or whatever it is,
[00:59:28] SPEAKER_00: like that doesn't really do any long term good.
[00:59:32] SPEAKER_00: I have a lot more borrowing.
[00:59:34] SPEAKER_00: So like in many ways to me,
[00:59:37] SPEAKER_00: the unlock AI is you be eye universal basic income.
[00:59:41] SPEAKER_00: It's like the injury angle,
[00:59:42] SPEAKER_00: I think was absolutely right about this.
[00:59:44] SPEAKER_00: In fact, the reason why I ran him from air in 2021
[00:59:47] SPEAKER_00: in New York, we lost,
[00:59:48] SPEAKER_00: but one of the main reasons that I was,
[00:59:51] SPEAKER_00: you know, put my support behind it
[00:59:54] SPEAKER_00: is because I truly believe that he's right about this,
[00:59:56] SPEAKER_00: which is you can't have a world
[00:59:59] SPEAKER_00: with 32 trillionaires and 18% unemployment.
[01:00:02] SPEAKER_00: Like that literally is not,
[01:00:04] SPEAKER_00: that's the French Revolution coming our way, right?
[01:00:06] SPEAKER_00: And by the way, deservedly so.
[01:00:09] SPEAKER_00: So if you want to have an economy
[01:00:12] SPEAKER_00: where people can prosper,
[01:00:14] SPEAKER_00: people have to have income.
[01:00:16] SPEAKER_00: And if it turns out that AI does in the short term,
[01:00:21] SPEAKER_00: displace lots and lots of jobs.
[01:00:23] SPEAKER_00: So I do believe that in a 25 year span,
[01:00:28] SPEAKER_00: we'll be able to look at and say,
[01:00:29] SPEAKER_00: oh, AI unlocked all these new industries
[01:00:31] SPEAKER_00: that we can't conceive of today and all of these jobs.
[01:00:33] SPEAKER_00: Just like the internet did,
[01:00:34] SPEAKER_00: just like the automobile did,
[01:00:35] SPEAKER_00: just like the steam engine did and everything else.
[01:00:38] But there's gonna be this 2025 year period
[01:00:42] SPEAKER_00: probably with massive amounts of uncertainty and job loss
[01:00:46] SPEAKER_00: while other entrepreneurs are figuring out some of the stuff,
[01:00:48] SPEAKER_00: right?
[01:00:49] SPEAKER_00: But as we know, like every startup that I invest in at C,
[01:00:52] SPEAKER_00: like I have no expectation of ever seeing liquidity
[01:00:55] SPEAKER_00: for a decade, right?
[01:00:56] SPEAKER_00: The seven year,
[01:00:57] SPEAKER_00: we're the seven year thing came from a decade.
[01:00:59] SPEAKER_00: It's all over, right?
[01:01:01] SPEAKER_02: Right.
[01:01:01] SPEAKER_02: I had a couple of lemonade was really fast.
[01:01:03] SPEAKER_00: I got a couple that were fast,
[01:01:05] SPEAKER_00: but by and large, it's a decade is the norm.
[01:01:10] So if someone in seven years creates something really exceptional,
[01:01:13] SPEAKER_00: like the US economic output
[01:01:16] SPEAKER_00: isn't gonna really probably be affected for 17 years, right?
[01:01:19] SPEAKER_00: So what happens in that 17 year interim,
[01:01:22] SPEAKER_00: people are gonna really struggle.
[01:01:24] SPEAKER_00: And if people are really struggling,
[01:01:26] SPEAKER_00: because they don't have enough money,
[01:01:27] SPEAKER_00: if they don't have enough money, they're not spending money, right?
[01:01:29] SPEAKER_00: Like I can't invest in companies that are gonna make a lot of money
[01:01:32] SPEAKER_00: if no one's buying the product.
[01:01:34] SPEAKER_00: At the end of the day,
[01:01:35] SPEAKER_00: every single thing I invest in is predicated on the notion
[01:01:38] SPEAKER_00: of selling someone a product or a service
[01:01:41] SPEAKER_00: for more money than a costless to produce set product or service.
[01:01:44] SPEAKER_00: Otherwise, it's not a business.
[01:01:45] SPEAKER_00: It's a hobby, like bookstore, right?
[01:01:47] SPEAKER_00: And so fundamentally,
[01:01:49] SPEAKER_00: people have to have money to spend.
[01:01:52] SPEAKER_00: And if businesses are so wildly efficient
[01:01:54] SPEAKER_00: that their spend is radically less
[01:01:55] SPEAKER_00: because they don't need it.
[01:01:57] SPEAKER_00: And if consumers have so much less money
[01:02:00] SPEAKER_00: because unemployment is 18% or whatever it is,
[01:02:03] SPEAKER_00: and people are really struggling,
[01:02:04] SPEAKER_00: they're not deploying capital.
[01:02:05] SPEAKER_00: That's called a depression, right?
[01:02:07] SPEAKER_00: And so to me fundamentally,
[01:02:10] SPEAKER_00: if you took AI and then combined it with,
[01:02:13] SPEAKER_00: how do we keep money in people's pockets?
[01:02:14] SPEAKER_00: You could have this tremendous boom.
[01:02:17] SPEAKER_00: I would argue that the bill that we just passed
[01:02:20] SPEAKER_00: is literally the opposite of that.
[01:02:22] That's interesting.
[01:02:23] SPEAKER_02: It's also interesting bringing up the Intel investment.
[01:02:28] SPEAKER_02: So that one happened,
[01:02:30] SPEAKER_02: and then also MP materials,
[01:02:32] SPEAKER_02: which by the way,
[01:02:33] SPEAKER_02: manufacturers a lot of their magnets through China,
[01:02:36] SPEAKER_02: so I don't really understand that one.
[01:02:37] SPEAKER_02: Well, I think it's because you're still assuming
[01:02:40] SPEAKER_00: some level of policy and consistency.
[01:02:44] SPEAKER_00: And I would argue it's just about individual gain and every case.
[01:02:47] SPEAKER_00: So if working with China helps a particular company
[01:02:51] SPEAKER_00: that now all of a sudden benefits certain people,
[01:02:54] SPEAKER_00: makes them more money,
[01:02:55] SPEAKER_00: they'll work with China.
[01:02:57] Even the US government?
[01:02:58] SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
[01:02:59] SPEAKER_00: I mean, it not generally know in this US government,
[01:03:02] what should happen to talk to you?
[01:03:04] SPEAKER_00: Is that not a deal with China?
[01:03:05] SPEAKER_00: Fair.
[01:03:07] Fair.
[01:03:08] SPEAKER_02: So then I guess what is your opinion
[01:03:09] SPEAKER_02: on all these US government deals?
[01:03:11] SPEAKER_02: I'm not a socialist.
[01:03:12] SPEAKER_00: I don't support it.
[01:03:14] SPEAKER_00: Like I believe in free enterprise,
[01:03:15] SPEAKER_00: which means free markets, intellectual property,
[01:03:19] SPEAKER_00: rule of law, investment research development,
[01:03:22] SPEAKER_00: investment in higher education,
[01:03:23] SPEAKER_00: as much immigration as possible,
[01:03:26] SPEAKER_00: that is how you unlock growth,
[01:03:28] SPEAKER_00: and we're not doing that.
[01:03:29] SPEAKER_00: This is just crony capitalism design
[01:03:31] SPEAKER_00: to benefit a handful of people,
[01:03:33] SPEAKER_00: the expense of everyone else,
[01:03:35] SPEAKER_00: and we are going to pay massive price for that.
[01:03:38] Scary.
[01:03:39] SPEAKER_02: Yeah, really fucking, by the way,
[01:03:42] SPEAKER_00: I am in the process of getting
[01:03:43] SPEAKER_00: in Portuguese citizenship right now.
[01:03:45] SPEAKER_00: Very.
[01:03:46] Less because I don't see myself living here,
[01:03:49] SPEAKER_00: but as a Jew, we have never had a period in the world
[01:03:54] SPEAKER_00: where we have lived in one country
[01:03:55] SPEAKER_00: for hundreds of years safely.
[01:03:58] SPEAKER_00: And I hope US is exception to that,
[01:04:00] SPEAKER_00: but I don't know that it is
[01:04:01] SPEAKER_00: and there's a lot to argue that anti-Semitism,
[01:04:03] SPEAKER_00: especially on the left,
[01:04:04] SPEAKER_00: is rising so significantly that.
[01:04:07] SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure that's really true.
[01:04:09] SPEAKER_00: And I would like my kids to have another option, right?
[01:04:13] SPEAKER_00: And it might be that the Portuguese passport
[01:04:15] is sitting in a drawer and safe for two decades
[01:04:18] SPEAKER_00: and we never touch them.
[01:04:19] SPEAKER_00: Great.
[01:04:20] SPEAKER_00: That's actually a really good outcome.
[01:04:22] SPEAKER_00: But ultimately, what I want to happen
[01:04:24] SPEAKER_00: is the crystal knock, which was the night,
[01:04:26] SPEAKER_00: kind of the beginning of the Holocaust effectively
[01:04:29] SPEAKER_00: where all of a sudden it was like open season on Jews.
[01:04:32] SPEAKER_00: That's not the time that you start figuring it out, right?
[01:04:34] SPEAKER_00: You figure it out now.
[01:04:35] SPEAKER_00: Now I am lucky enough that Portugal's still a country
[01:04:38] SPEAKER_00: where effectively you can purchase citizenship.
[01:04:41] And that's what I'm doing, right?
[01:04:42] SPEAKER_00: Because I have the ability to do that luckily.
[01:04:44] SPEAKER_00: But I would argue that if you can do that,
[01:04:48] SPEAKER_00: you should because if you just take everything
[01:04:51] SPEAKER_00: that I just said, if you just agree with everything I said
[01:04:53] SPEAKER_00: for the last hour or whatever it is, then sure, no need.
[01:04:56] SPEAKER_00: But if you take the fundamental things
[01:04:59] SPEAKER_00: I've talked about in terms of,
[01:05:01] as you're some mentality,
[01:05:03] SPEAKER_00: the underlying long-term damage to the US economy
[01:05:07] SPEAKER_00: and the capitalist system,
[01:05:11] SPEAKER_00: and then arguably not even investing the things that allow
[01:05:13] SPEAKER_00: you to take the beginning of our conversation,
[01:05:15] SPEAKER_00: humanity and the race to outpace saving over destroying,
[01:05:20] SPEAKER_00: all of that does not argue for the long-term future
[01:05:23] SPEAKER_00: of this country.
[01:05:25] SPEAKER_00: And I'd like to have another option.
[01:05:27] Okay.
[01:05:28] Well, those people are really depressing podcasts.
[01:05:30] SPEAKER_00: No, we'll amp it up.
[01:05:32] SPEAKER_02: That's not, you know.
[01:05:33] SPEAKER_00: So music, Lance, what can you do to make it better?
[01:05:36] Did you like?
[01:05:36] Let's play some raid music, I don't know.
[01:05:39] SPEAKER_02: Okay, so maybe a positive question,
[01:05:43] SPEAKER_02: but what is the biggest lesson you learned
[01:05:48] SPEAKER_02: from working with Travis Kalenik?
[01:05:51] A lot.
[01:05:52] SPEAKER_00: And I understand that he took a beating in terms
[01:05:57] SPEAKER_00: of his reputation at the end of Uber.
[01:06:00] SPEAKER_00: I am an unapologetic, Travis enthusiast.
[01:06:04] SPEAKER_00: Did he make mistakes?
[01:06:05] SPEAKER_00: Absolutely.
[01:06:06] SPEAKER_00: But there were generally mistakes of omission
[01:06:09] SPEAKER_00: where he was so focused on growth
[01:06:12] SPEAKER_00: and investment and things like that
[01:06:14] SPEAKER_00: that he really didn't pay enough attention
[01:06:16] SPEAKER_00: to the underlying management of the company itself.
[01:06:19] SPEAKER_00: And he paid a master of price for that.
[01:06:21] SPEAKER_00: But I think he's one of these smartest,
[01:06:24] SPEAKER_00: the two smartest people that I've ever worked with closely
[01:06:27] SPEAKER_00: are Mike Bloomberg and Travis Kalenik, Bar None.
[01:06:30] SPEAKER_00: I remember one time, this is up before we were gonna have
[01:06:34] SPEAKER_00: like a New York office.
[01:06:35] SPEAKER_00: So he was hanging out of my office
[01:06:37] SPEAKER_00: and I was, we were in a conference room together,
[01:06:40] SPEAKER_00: but I was on another call while he was working or whatever.
[01:06:46] SPEAKER_00: So he only heard while he was doing his own work,
[01:06:48] SPEAKER_00: 50% of the conversation.
[01:06:50] SPEAKER_00: And it was some potential campaign around like gas,
[01:06:53] SPEAKER_00: importation, it was really complicated, right?
[01:06:56] SPEAKER_00: I barely knew what I was talking about.
[01:06:58] SPEAKER_00: He only heard half of it.
[01:06:59] SPEAKER_00: And when the call was over, just hearing my half,
[01:07:02] SPEAKER_00: then explained to me everything that I got right and wrong
[01:07:05] SPEAKER_00: and where this thing needs to go
[01:07:06] SPEAKER_00: and how their business should work.
[01:07:08] SPEAKER_00: And he was fucking right.
[01:07:09] SPEAKER_00: The dude is a genius number one, too.
[01:07:13] He is relentless and I think in some ways,
[01:07:18] his relentlessness actually has become a little bit
[01:07:22] SPEAKER_00: of a mistake in the sense that other people say,
[01:07:24] SPEAKER_00: oh, I need a Travis Kalen or like founder
[01:07:27] SPEAKER_00: with his relentlessness.
[01:07:29] SPEAKER_00: His relentless is unquestionably a superpower.
[01:07:32] SPEAKER_00: It works for him.
[01:07:34] SPEAKER_00: There are other times where I've met founders
[01:07:36] SPEAKER_00: who were almost trying to imitate him
[01:07:38] SPEAKER_00: and they're hyper aggressive without sort of
[01:07:40] SPEAKER_00: the underlying substance being there behind it.
[01:07:42] SPEAKER_00: And it's actually that's really bad.
[01:07:44] SPEAKER_00: Like that's actually worse than not being hyper aggressive.
[01:07:47] SPEAKER_00: But when you combine his substance, his work ethic
[01:07:51] SPEAKER_00: and his relentlessness, it's sort of an exceptional combination.
[01:07:56] SPEAKER_00: He saw the future, man, like the very first time
[01:07:59] SPEAKER_00: I met him in person, remember he said to me,
[01:08:01] SPEAKER_00: one day no one will own a car,
[01:08:03] SPEAKER_00: they'll all drive themselves and you'll get it
[01:08:05] SPEAKER_00: by pressing the button.
[01:08:06] SPEAKER_00: And he said that long before anyone else did,
[01:08:09] SPEAKER_00: well, this is what long before anyone
[01:08:10] SPEAKER_00: was like a futurist that just writes things
[01:08:11] SPEAKER_00: but doesn't actually do anything.
[01:08:14] And did more to make that happen
[01:08:16] SPEAKER_00: than probably anyone in the world, maybe him and Elon.
[01:08:19] SPEAKER_00: And so he saw it so much from before.
[01:08:23] SPEAKER_00: And even politically, my first book,
[01:08:26] SPEAKER_00: I call this Travis's Law, which was the notion
[01:08:28] SPEAKER_00: of what we talked about.
[01:08:30] SPEAKER_00: If you have a product that people really passionate about
[01:08:34] SPEAKER_00: and you have the right means to mobilize them,
[01:08:37] SPEAKER_00: you can turn your customers into political advocates
[01:08:39] SPEAKER_00: and be big, powerful and trans-interest, right?
[01:08:43] Like I might have deployed that really well
[01:08:45] SPEAKER_00: and I might have taken that thought
[01:08:47] SPEAKER_00: other startups I've invested in,
[01:08:49] but that was his insight, not mine, right?
[01:08:51] SPEAKER_00: And that's to me one of the biggest political innovations
[01:08:54] SPEAKER_00: we've seen in decades.
[01:08:56] SPEAKER_00: So he is one of the most unique people that I know,
[01:09:00] SPEAKER_00: I am biased, I am in cloud kitchen,
[01:09:02] so I'm not objective.
[01:09:04] SPEAKER_00: And I also just think that there's a humanity to Travis
[01:09:08] SPEAKER_00: because he's a shy, even awkward guy.
[01:09:12] SPEAKER_00: He's not someone that socializes,
[01:09:14] SPEAKER_00: he has his friends or whatever,
[01:09:15] SPEAKER_00: but he's not out there on the social scene
[01:09:17] SPEAKER_00: and all that much.
[01:09:18] SPEAKER_00: And so people don't really know,
[01:09:19] SPEAKER_00: so all they know are the stereotypes with him
[01:09:22] SPEAKER_00: and what media does in general is they build you up
[01:09:28] and they tear you down.
[01:09:29] SPEAKER_00: And then I've been arguing to him,
[01:09:31] SPEAKER_00: hey, we're due for the build up again,
[01:09:33] SPEAKER_00: although he's like, I'm good.
[01:09:34] SPEAKER_00: I haven't been here, I haven't gone to the script.
[01:09:36] SPEAKER_00: So that's not bad.
[01:09:38] SPEAKER_00: But so he got built up,
[01:09:40] SPEAKER_00: was he ever as absolutely heroic and superhuman
[01:09:45] SPEAKER_00: as all those profiles in 2013, 2014,
[01:09:49] SPEAKER_00: where he walked into an airport and there'd be like,
[01:09:51] SPEAKER_00: you know, 100 magazines displayed outward
[01:09:53] SPEAKER_00: in his face on the cover, every one of them.
[01:09:54] SPEAKER_00: No, he's a human being.
[01:09:56] SPEAKER_00: Was he in any way what he was made out to be
[01:09:59] SPEAKER_00: when he left Uber?
[01:10:01] SPEAKER_00: Not even in the slightest, right?
[01:10:02] SPEAKER_00: He's a human being, but I think with that said,
[01:10:05] SPEAKER_00: he is one of the most remarkable human beings
[01:10:08] SPEAKER_00: I've ever met.
[01:10:10] That was a really good answer.
[01:10:11] SPEAKER_02: By the way, I'm sure a lot of people who are, you know,
[01:10:13] SPEAKER_00: not Travis fans will hear this and be angry about it.
[01:10:16] SPEAKER_00: I don't care.
[01:10:17] SPEAKER_00: I've known the guy now for almost 15 years.
[01:10:19] SPEAKER_00: I've worked with him for 15 years.
[01:10:21] SPEAKER_00: I stand by every word of it.
[01:10:23] Wow.
[01:10:24] Well, that answers my Brex question.
[01:10:27] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[01:10:27] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[01:10:29] SPEAKER_02: No, that's great.
[01:10:30] SPEAKER_02: I usually ask a Brex question on like founder performance
[01:10:33] SPEAKER_02: and I think that really, yes.
[01:10:36] SPEAKER_02: Okay.
[01:10:37] SPEAKER_00: But the problem is, and I have this problem too,
[01:10:39] SPEAKER_00: he is not a good cop for anyone or anything else.
[01:10:43] SPEAKER_00: I had the same thing in government, right?
[01:10:44] SPEAKER_00: Where like if you only ever worked in government
[01:10:47] SPEAKER_00: politics for Mike Bloomberg,
[01:10:49] SPEAKER_00: you're actually useless to everybody else
[01:10:51] SPEAKER_00: because he was so different and so incredible
[01:10:55] SPEAKER_00: and so unlike the norm that it almost ruins you
[01:10:59] SPEAKER_00: for like any other normal performance or situation.
[01:11:02] SPEAKER_00: And Travis in a lot of ways was like that too.
[01:11:05] SPEAKER_00: So when I try, I really try to not let my experience
[01:11:12] SPEAKER_00: with Travis influence too much
[01:11:14] SPEAKER_00: my thinking about other founders and companies
[01:11:16] SPEAKER_00: because it's a terrible comp.
[01:11:18] SPEAKER_02: Like for better and for worse, whatever it is,
[01:11:20] SPEAKER_00: like you're not gonna have another one of him or like,
[01:11:23] SPEAKER_00: like I've met a lot of investment since Uber
[01:11:27] SPEAKER_00: and someone that have been really successful,
[01:11:30] SPEAKER_00: none of them are Uber and I'm never gonna make as much money
[01:11:32] SPEAKER_00: as I did on Uber and anything again.
[01:11:35] SPEAKER_00: Like that's just one of one.
[01:11:36] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, total one of one.
[01:11:38] SPEAKER_02: That's insane.
[01:11:40] Okay, well Bradley, we are over time.
