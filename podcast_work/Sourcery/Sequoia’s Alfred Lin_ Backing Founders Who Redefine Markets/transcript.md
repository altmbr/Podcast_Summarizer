[00:00:00] **Alfred Lin:** Airbnb entered 2020 as the number one IPO candidate.
[00:00:05] It was this big fanfare and we're going to go public early in the year.
[00:00:09] From January, February, March, then April, we saw the growth rate just steadily decline as COVID
[00:00:16] starts spreading around. And at some point, it went negative. That's pretty scary.
[00:00:21] We don't love the word speed at Sequoia. We love the word velocity.
[00:00:25] Velocity is a vector. It is a direction and you want people aligned to that direction.
[00:00:30] How did you partner with Citadel Securities?
[00:00:33] Well, it's funny because I would have never imagined that Ken Griffin would sell a portion
[00:00:38] of Citadel Securities. Our partner Constantine met Ken at a conference and developed a relationship
[00:00:44] and over time, I think it's over like two and a half years where he kept asking,
[00:00:48] Ken, could we ever invest in Citadel Securities?
[00:00:51] And I think Ken said no many, many times and Constantine did not stop.
[00:00:56] And so it was a team effort. Constantine obviously sourced a developed relationship with Ken.
[00:01:02] Doug helped, I helped, we eventually broke through and got Ken comfortable with how
[00:01:07] Sequoia was going to help with the company building side. We may not know anything about
[00:01:12] market making, but we do know how to build technology businesses. And that's the type of help
[00:01:16] that Ken wanted around the table for Citadel Securities.
[00:01:31] **Molly:** I was fortunate enough to listen to you speak at four runners AI consumer AI conference.
[00:01:40] I think it was a couple of months back. And there were two things that really stuck out to me.
[00:01:45] One that I mentioned on a podcast with Brian Kim from Andreessen Horowitz.
[00:01:49] But one thing you mentioned about these cycles, which I thought was just it was like encapsulated
[00:01:53] so well, is you said things that happened three months ago are not relevant today. Things
[00:01:58] are happening today are not going to be relevant in three months. Do you think that's going to
[00:02:02] continue? Do you think it's going to compress more? How did you get to that framework of thinking?
[00:02:08] **Alfred Lin:** In the beginning of any technology cycle, it does feel frenetic. There's just so much changing
[00:02:15] people are experimenting, people are trying new things. And I think the things that I observed
[00:02:22] was the things, the interesting papers, the interesting research in AI that we're talking about
[00:02:28] today. We didn't talk about three months ago, which by definition we're not going to talk about
[00:02:32] whatever we're talking about today. What we may not be talking about three months from now. It's
[00:02:37] very hard for founders and not time frame because what you want to do as a founder is to have a
[00:02:43] vision of a company that matters 10 years from now. If you're going to start a company today
[00:02:51] and it takes a decade to build a interesting company, you want something stable over time.
[00:02:58] And the thing that's stable right now may be that AI is going to transform the world, but how it
[00:03:03] does is very, very tricky. And so I think the great thing about that is startups are a lot more
[00:03:12] nimble than large companies. And they're going to be able to sort of experiment and do different
[00:03:16] things that large companies are not able to do. And so we're seeing more innovation. We're seeing
[00:03:23] more younger founders get into the game because experience is not as important as just innovation.
[00:03:32] And I stand by that. And for a period of time, there's going to be a lot of innovation. There's
[00:03:37] going to be a lot of companies that unfortunately won't make it, but we're going to out of all of this.
[00:03:43] There are going to be some substantial companies that are created because AI is going to be
[00:03:48] is probably the largest and most powerful technology Megatron in my lifetime.
[00:03:55] **Molly:** Why do you think markets collapse typically to two to three leaders?
[00:04:00] **Alfred Lin:** It doesn't always have to collapse that way. The restaurant business doesn't collapse to two or
[00:04:05] three leaders. I think in technology, there is an element, there is an element of network effects.
[00:04:14] There is a brand network effect. And a lot of businesses
[00:04:17] want to be able to trade off between one or two alternatives. So you don't want to
[00:04:25] make one be the company. And for the cloud, there's AWS, there's GCP, there's Azure. Because
[00:04:35] if I am Goldman Sachs, I want to be able to trade off and be able to use all of them.
[00:04:41] And if you're DoorDash or UberEats, some level consolidation is good because otherwise,
[00:04:50] you're just constantly fighting with a bunch of players. And so there's a natural for
[00:04:56] there's a natural network effect in those businesses where it consolidates to number one,
[00:05:02] number two, and maybe a number three.
[00:05:04] **Molly:** The other thing that I really liked what you set on stage was build for the world.
[00:05:11] There's eight billion people here. You should think bigger. Specifically, you started,
[00:05:16] and I don't want to put words in your mouth. So you should say this yourself. But you started
[00:05:20] off with like that specific area in San Francisco where we were and like the broader area,
[00:05:26] and then you expanded more and more and more. Why do you think it's important to think like that
[00:05:31] when you're starting a company? 
[00:05:33] **Alfred Lin:** Well, over the years, I found that there's an element and a
[00:05:39] desire to be called Tish. And part of being called Tish is to help create a religion around
[00:05:46] something. And in the very early days, when I was working with with different tools, there's a
[00:05:52] company called email reader called Pine. And literally the name of Pine is Pine is not Elm,
[00:05:59] which was a previous email reader. And then you had the Mac and the PC Wars. There's a religion
[00:06:05] around the Mac and the PC. You have bit of a religion around the cloud. You have bit of religion
[00:06:11] around Andrew versus iPhone. And yet, what you really want to do is not be Web 2 or Web 3. You
[00:06:19] just want to build for the Web if you're an entrepreneur. And so yeah, we were sitting in the
[00:06:26] Presidio. So I said, don't build for San Francisco, which has probably 800,000 people. You may start
[00:06:33] there. You might want to your ICP might be 800,000 people. And maybe everybody in San Francisco,
[00:06:40] because you're going to launch in San Francisco. But you have to think broader. All of the Bay
[00:06:44] area is about 8 million people. But you want to move beyond that. And you can want to be able to
[00:06:49] reach the world. And that's how many companies started. And DoorDash started with
[00:06:56] University Avenue, who was much smaller. It was around the Stanford campus. And then all of
[00:07:01] Palo Alto, then a few cities, then nationwide. And now they're trying to go internationally. They
[00:07:09] have a strong presence in Europe. And they're going to want to build for the whole world.
[00:07:15] **Molly:** With Airbnb, specifically, they went through a really dramatic period during COVID. How did you
[00:07:24] help them navigate that if you did? What did you learn from the way that Brian navigated that?
[00:07:32] And what do you think of founder mode? 
[00:07:35] **Alfred Lin:** I think one of the things that
[00:07:37] was fascinating about the Airbnb story. And Brian has credit on his leadership is he really,
[00:07:47] really knows how to navigate through a crisis. And I think people forget some of the facts. But he
[00:07:56] Airbnb entered 2020 as the number one IPO candidate of 2020. And this is big fanfare. And we're
[00:08:08] going to go public early in the year. And from January, February, March, and then April, we saw
[00:08:16] the growth rate just steadily decline as COVID starts running throughout the world. And at some
[00:08:23] point, he went negative. That's pretty scary. A company that used to grow in 30, 40% a year, I
[00:08:31] went to losing 80% of its revenue. And I think it was very reasonable for a lot of us who are focused
[00:08:42] on a variety of things to just go inward. But Brian was thinking about his team. He wanted to make
[00:08:49] sure that Airbnb survive this pandemic, but also for generations. And that was, you know, in some
[00:08:58] sense, resilience is about having purpose. And he had purpose. He wanted, he's always wanted to
[00:09:07] build Airbnb into so that everybody can belong and belong anywhere. That purpose, he was not going
[00:09:15] to give up. But that's in your head. And then used to think about it from the heart.
[00:09:22] This is like true suffering, like you lost 80% of your revenue. You can either choose to hope
[00:09:28] or you can be in despair. And for him, he was he's optimistic. He was a hopeful person.
[00:09:36] Um, he chose hope. What are the bright, shiny things that were still working, even though things were
[00:09:46] were in decline. It was it was experiences because we could do virtual experiences. And it was
[00:09:53] actually short sort of shorter distance days. Airbnb had been a cross-border company where you
[00:10:00] traveled internationally, went to different parts of the world. And now we saw people leaving
[00:10:05] New York City to go upstate New York, leaving San Francisco to get to Napa. And that business
[00:10:11] still was working and thriving. So he focused on the places that were still really positive in this
[00:10:19] business. And he stayed really calm. And he stayed really calm to we call these things
[00:10:28] crystal moments. You have to become an untangle all of the noise to find the direction that you
[00:10:35] need to go and to accelerate out of this situation. And then finally, so you have the the purpose in
[00:10:47] your head, the sort of the hope in your heart. And then I just think that physically he just kept
[00:10:55] doing the work. Every day he got up, he had an all hands, he had a team meeting. Every Sunday,
[00:11:02] we had we had a board meeting. He prepped everybody from the board all the way down to all of his
[00:11:09] employees on what we were going to do. And that was a significant change. Along the way, he would
[00:11:17] call me and we would bounce off ideas. Obviously, we needed to raise money. Do we do it in equity?
[00:11:23] Do we do it in debt? Equity would be very punitive at that time. We decided to do it in debt.
[00:11:30] And we decided that we were going to cut expenses, but there's a there's a framework, which is
[00:11:38] you cut them, you cut marketing because we didn't need to market anymore. We cut offices, we cut
[00:11:43] contractors. And then the last thing he wanted to do was to have a layoff, but he had to do that
[00:11:50] eventually. And so it was a very, very logical, almost very thought-through way of dealing with
[00:11:57] the crisis, even though the crisis is happening so fast.

[00:12:57] Sorcery. That's B-R-E-X.com slash Sorcery. I find it interesting because I feel like his
[00:13:05] decisions as a founder at that time and as a leader on the external presence made it,
[00:13:17] I don't know how to put this. It made it that company and his leadership super attractive to
[00:13:23] go work there. But in a situation like that, that would crumble your culture. You would be doing
[00:13:30] layoffs. People would not be feeling very secure. It would be very disorienting. But having
[00:13:35] strong leadership does attract strong talent. I'm curious, how do you think about talent shifts
[00:13:43] and culture and resetting those cultures through these turbulent times? 
[00:13:48] **Alfred Lin:** Leadership is about making
[00:13:50] hard decisions in my opinion. And in difficult times, true leadership shows. Culture is also
[00:13:59] about hard decisions in hard times. If you think you have a great culture during good times,
[00:14:07] you don't really know whether that culture survives during bad times. A great culture survives
[00:14:12] bad times. And the test of leadership and the test of culture is going through bad times.
[00:14:18] Which is why, in some sense, the companies that do extremely well have it hard early.
[00:14:25] And they can take lessons and they can shape their culture early to survive and to be resilient
[00:14:34] during hard times. Airbnb, they talk about the fact that it was very, very hard for them to
[00:14:40] raise any money in the early days. And then we gloss over that because they had this nice,
[00:14:46] long glide path for a period of time. But yeah, they started. It was tough. Nobody thought that
[00:14:53] we should fund a company where strangers are staying with other strangers.
[00:14:59] But he had a vision. I often talk about the fact that someone else's feature is another person's
[00:15:05] bug. Brian just thought that, you know, my father who loves staying at hotels and the same hotel
[00:15:12] in the same room because he wanted no variance when he travels for business.
[00:15:18] But I thought that that was kind of my numbing. And he wanted to create a company where people
[00:15:25] traveled much more authentically. And he brought that to life. And the pandemic showed
[00:15:37] that the culture he created and the leadership that he has can survive both good and bad times.
[00:15:43] **Molly:** What do you think that means for being a founder and a highly competitive or highly,
[00:15:51] it could go both ways because they're both, you know, like extreme environments, either highly
[00:15:56] competitive or highly turbulent. What do you think that means to be a founder? Like what kind of,
[00:16:01] what do you need to, how do you need to show up? 
[00:16:04] **Alfred Lin:** I think you show up with a vision and a
[00:16:06] North Star. And you measure your speed in the right direction. So we don't love the word speed
[00:16:17] at Sequoia. We love the word velocity. Velocity is a vector. It has a direction and act the magnitude.
[00:16:24] And you want to go in that direction that you want to go in and you want to people align to that
[00:16:28] direction. Motion is not equal progress. And you've heard that before from
[00:16:36] Friday to different people. And getting a company to align and march in the same direction
[00:16:44] is what is really important during turbulent times. Because it's very easy to run around with
[00:16:51] as if your head was cut off during crisis. It's very easy to see every little shiny penny that
[00:17:00] pops up because there's so much change in AI and try to go after a thousand different things.
[00:17:08] But your leadership as a founder is to make sure the company is focused in the right direction.
[00:17:14] **Molly:** There's some interesting card data around this cycle in AI. And there is a premium that
[00:17:22] AI native companies are getting. And it's more dramatic in the series A and series B.
[00:17:29] But given the macro on the AI environment, how do you set a culture for AI or to rebuild for AI?
[00:17:38] I guess like let me just let me reposition all of that. Talking about cultures
[00:17:46] and in this new AI era, there are teams that have to reset and rebuild. How do you help
[00:17:53] orient or what would you say is like the best practice or principles to use to rebuild those
[00:17:59] cultures for AI? There's founders like Brian Armstrong that are making really hard pivots or
[00:18:08] I guess like statements in his company, everybody needs to learn how to use AI in this week if they're
[00:18:13] not, they're fired. And then there are others that are maybe taking it a little bit less intensely.
[00:18:19] But how do you think about setting cultures in the AI era and rebuilding them?
[00:18:24] **Alfred Lin:** I think you want to build a culture where people pursue growth and learning period. And so right now,
[00:18:30] it might be AI. And you want to learn all the tools that can help you build things faster,
[00:18:37] automate things, etc. But when the internet happened, you wanted every single person in the company
[00:18:44] to learn about the internet. When mobile happened, you wanted everybody to learn about mobile.
[00:18:49] When cloud happened, you wanted to have developers learn about how to
[00:18:53] watch things in the cloud. And so I think you want your culture to stand for innovation,
[00:19:02] stand for progress, and stand for growth. And the companies that survive over time have had to
[00:19:10] have at one and at two and do things that are hard. I mean, how does Amazon, which is an e-commerce
[00:19:19] company, be a cloud company and build AWS? How does that, but who was just focused on shoes, go
[00:19:27] from all these other categories? How does Airbnb go from home sharing to all accommodations,
[00:19:37] to experiences? Whether it was AI or not, you needed a culture that was going to be innovative
[00:19:45] and continue to sort of push the envelope of what can be done. And so DoorDash had to do that
[00:19:53] from restaurant delivery to grocery to convenience to international. Maybe sort of take a step back
[00:19:59] on your specific question. I think for clay, I'll just use clay as an example, where they started
[00:20:07] as trying to bring programming to the masses. They built something and there were no, there are
[00:20:14] not enough users who thought that this was something that they wanted. They didn't know what to do
[00:20:20] with it. And so Karim decided to use his own product for go to market. And then they developed this
[00:20:28] whole notion of go to market engineer. That was the first sort of thing that sort of made clay
[00:20:33] into what it is today. But then, okay, well, we're in the world of AI. How do we automatically update
[00:20:41] these leads using AI? How do we use more AI tools to help users learn the product so that they
[00:20:50] can prompt clay to do the things that they want? That gets built into the culture because they've
[00:20:57] constantly been an innovative and learning company. And that's what you want to build.
[00:21:03] **Molly:** I want to go back to the beginning when we were talking about all the categories you go after.
[00:21:07] Specifically, within AI, a company that I've gone to know a little bit more recently is
[00:21:16] profound. And this whole new world, it's a category creator. From one, you know, another thing that I've
[00:21:23] heard from all your founders is you really back category creators. Kyle, she's absolutely a
[00:21:28] category creator. I think they're going to be there. Airbnb, for sure. Profound is
[00:21:37] it's just like it's totally new. Who thought you would need SEO for LLMs and all these
[00:21:43] sorts of things? But I'm curious from your standpoint, could you one breakdown profound?
[00:21:49] But then to how you think about, I just want to understand, who is Alfred as an investor?
[00:21:55] Because you back so many different kinds of companies. How do you find them? And what makes you
[00:22:02] attracted to them? 
[00:22:03] **Alfred Lin:** Well, profound is a great company. Let's start there. And they are going to
[00:22:08] create this category of helping brands build their brand on AI. And if we start searching more and
[00:22:19] more on AI and trying to get more information, brands have to show up in foundation models and
[00:22:25] AI the way that they want to show up. And so it is creating a whole new category. But I don't
[00:22:31] think they're going to stop there. They're going to think about what marketing is going to be
[00:22:35] and how it's going to be different in the world of AI, not just showing showing up on AI SEO.
[00:22:43] That's the initial edge. But James has a much, much broader vision for recreating marketing the way
[00:22:51] we know it. One of the things that over all of these sort of mega trends that I've been fortunate
[00:22:58] to live through is that the business models change. The internet, there was a lot of innovation
[00:23:04] around advertising. Ad units change. Keywords became something that we bid on. This is just new
[00:23:12] innovation. With SAS, obviously, there was this change in selling seats and selling it in a
[00:23:18] subscription model versus licenses. Mobile, we had, you know, in our purchases, we had
[00:23:25] freemium models where you got the free version of the product and if you liked it, you upgrade.
[00:23:32] These things are like, are really interesting because I may not be able to build the product,
[00:23:38] but I can help founders reimagine what business models are going to be. And I think AI with
[00:23:45] the technology that's coming, we're going to reimagine a lot of business models. And so that's
[00:23:49] really fun. And so when you ask, you know, who am I as an investor? I don't love the word
[00:23:58] investor. Back to, we love being partners to the founders that we back in the management team
[00:24:02] that they hire. I'm really a partner to solve, to help solve these problems. And maybe another
[00:24:09] way of thinking about me as an investor, these all these different categories, I just see
[00:24:15] specialness in the founders and that they're designed to go change the world.
[00:24:21] This is a very fun business because I get to meet with the found these wonderful founders
[00:24:29] who want to go change the world. Even if I don't agree with them, I just love hearing the stories
[00:24:34] that and their insights.

[00:25:14] Partner with Citadel Securities. 
[00:25:17] **Alfred Lin:** Well, it's funny because my brother is head of
[00:25:21] Fixing and Common Macro at Citadel, the hedge fund. I would have never imagined
[00:25:30] that Ken Griffin would sell a portion of Citadel Securities, this market-making business.
[00:25:35] I've asked him about the business and he's just like, yeah, it's interesting.
[00:25:41] But our partner Constantine met Ken at a conference and went up to Ken and talked to him and
[00:25:53] struck a developer relationship. Over time, I think it's over like two and a half years where he
[00:26:00] kept asking, Ken, could we ever invest in Citadel Securities? I think Ken said no many, many times,
[00:26:10] and Constantine did not stop. It was a team effort. Constantine obviously sourced a
[00:26:17] developer relationship with Ken. Doug helped. I helped. We eventually broke through and got
[00:26:25] Ken comfortable with how Sequoia was going to help with the company building side.
[00:26:32] We may not know anything about market-making, but we do know how to build technology businesses.
[00:26:37] And that's the type of help that Ken wanted around the table for Citadel Securities.
[00:26:43] Because fundamentally, it is a technology company. In some ways, it is an AI company. They've
[00:26:50] been using math to find ways to make money and calculate arbitrages and calculate risk for
[00:27:00] those arbitrages for a long, long period of time. They know how to do that. We know how to help
[00:27:07] them build technology, build and grow a technology company. 
[00:27:11] **Molly:** So, why did you want to invest?
[00:27:16] **Alfred Lin:** Maybe in another life, I was supposed to work at Citadel Securities.
[00:27:21] As you know, I go all the way back to I was born in Taiwan. I grew up mostly in New York City.
[00:27:32] I came to this to the US, not knowing any words of English.
[00:27:37] And my parents were like, yeah, you're kind of bad at languages. I was always bad at languages.
[00:27:43] So, you better study math and do it well. So, my study math, I went to Harvard and studied
[00:27:50] applied math. They took a class from Robert Merton. And the class is called continuous time
[00:27:56] finance. Few years later, he would win the Nobel Prize for his work on continuous time finance.
[00:28:03] And I asked him for a job at this place called Long Term Capital.
[00:28:10] And he said, you know, you're pretty smart and you're pretty good at math. You should probably go
[00:28:15] get a PhD and then come and ask me for a job. I said, okay. So, I came out to Stanford to get a
[00:28:24] PhD in statistics. And I fell in love with the internet. So, I dropped out.
[00:28:31] A few years later, when I was at link exchange, I was the CFO acting CFO at the time. We're
[00:28:38] trying to take link exchange public. The market was dropping 100 points an hour.
[00:28:43] Sorry, August 31, 1998, it was dropping 100 points an hour. And
[00:28:47] it was because Long Term Capital was blowing up. So, I dodged a bullet by not going to Long Term Capital.
[00:28:55] But, you know, there was some ricochet because we couldn't take link exchange public. We
[00:28:59] eventually saw it to Microsoft. But, you know, I could have ended up working for a hedge fund or
[00:29:06] for Citadel, Citadel securities or Citadel or some company like that. You know, growing up,
[00:29:13] I think most of my family members, definitely my mom and my dad would have thought my brother would
[00:29:20] have worked in entrepreneurship because he's sort of the extrovert. He's charming. And I was the
[00:29:28] introvert awkward. So, I was going to work either be a professor or work in a hedge fund. But
[00:29:35] the two of us swapped places in some ways. 
[00:29:38] **Molly:** Wow. And then that led you to having a piece of it.
[00:29:44] Life is funny in that way. Sentimental, I like that. IPOs are causing a lot of demand. Demand from
[00:29:54] people like Citadel, public market investors, those types of personas to want more of these tech
[00:30:02] companies to go public. It's good for the ecosystem. But there is like a little bit of a pressure
[00:30:07] there. There's a little bit of pressure from investors for DPI. I'll share some information
[00:30:14] in the comments on some card of data for that that's coming out today. But
[00:30:21] how would you advise companies as they think about these exit scenarios? And I was like, well,
[00:30:27] why wouldn't you want to get acquired? So like putting that to the side. How do you help your
[00:30:35] companies think about exit scenarios? Whether it's through M&A, going to IPO, what makes a company,
[00:30:42] a public market company, or other routes of exits? 
[00:30:46] **Alfred Lin:** The exits is not something that I spend a
[00:30:49] lot of time thinking about or the founders I work with in general. I think the reason that is,
[00:30:59] if you focus on building a great business and a great company, then exit opportunities will
[00:31:07] abound. There's always, if you need to raise money, whether it's in good or bad market, if you have
[00:31:15] a great company, you won't be able to raise money. And that's true privately, and that's true in
[00:31:20] the IPO market. That's true after the IPO where you may raise financing in the public markets
[00:31:28] through a secondary or through to a debt. And so I've always asked founders to focus on building
[00:31:35] a great company first and foremost. On exits, it is the timing of an IPO, the timing of whether you
[00:31:44] sell the company has a lot to do with what the founder wants to do. I always tell founders,
[00:31:51] an IPO is another fundraising round. It just happens that you're selling it to the public,
[00:31:58] and you can get some liquidity for your early shareholders and your employees. But it is a fundraising
[00:32:06] round. And are you prepared to be a public company? Are you prepared to give quarterly earnings and
[00:32:13] guidance and all of those things? It's about preparedness on the IPO. On an exit,
[00:32:20] one of the things to think of through is this is a terminal price, but more importantly,
[00:32:26] whether when you sell the company to the acquireer, whether it fulfills your vision. And in some cases,
[00:32:35] it does. You can partner with a larger platform to help fulfill your vision. And that's the best
[00:32:43] scenario. You don't want to just be, you don't want to just merge with another company and then
[00:32:48] have the product get shut down. You want it to thrive inside of the acquiring company.
[00:32:55] **Molly:** Sorcery is very proud to be sponsored by Brex, hard pivot, surprise. Brex is all about
[00:33:04] spending smarter, moving faster, the intelligent finance platform. They love performance.
[00:33:09] And so I'm curious from you, how do you measure performance? What are the metrics that you use to
[00:33:15] determine? This is when I want to enter an investment with the company. And this is when I want to
[00:33:21] follow on in investing. 
[00:33:23] **Alfred Lin:** I think I think the performance metrics for each company is very
[00:33:26] bespoke to them. Obviously, we look at things such as, for example, unit economics, how well
[00:33:36] the customers were retaining. Those are the numbers behind the numbers. And we focus much more on
[00:33:43] those numbers than on pure revenue growth and profit going. 
[00:33:48] **Molly:** Going to cart a data,
[00:33:52] they had a question to the market. And to all the companies that are on the platform,
[00:33:58] do AI companies command a premium? AI software companies that raised in the first half of 2025,
[00:34:04] saw 30.9% higher valuation. So this is about a $55 million valuation versus 42 million dollars.
[00:34:12] It is a hot market for AI. And the one thing that I'm somewhat concerned about is many of these
[00:34:19] companies that we call AI companies, their software companies, their security companies,
[00:34:24] their customer service companies. In probably two or three years, we want to call them AI
[00:34:28] companies. Just the same way that internet companies over time, there were native internet
[00:34:35] companies. But over time, every company became an internet company. Every company became a
[00:34:40] mobile company. And so we try to think about whether the premium is deserved or not. And
[00:34:49] these premiums that are being paid, probably someone is because we believe that the market and
[00:34:59] the market sizes are expanding. And if you told people back all the way in the internet that
[00:35:06] online advertising was going to be as big as it is today, they would laugh at you.
[00:35:12] And so right now, I think there's a lot higher premiums, 20% 30% is because we believe that
[00:35:20] the market sizes are going to be much, much larger. And we've given some of this data,
[00:35:28] partner Pat Grady and Sonya Huang, when they hosted AI ascent, they showed this map of
[00:35:34] when SaaS was created, we had a certain size of the software market and we thought SaaS was going
[00:35:41] to be a big portion of the size of the software market. It turns out that SaaS is even bigger than
[00:35:48] all of the software market in the past. We grew the software market. What AI has the potential
[00:35:55] of doing is looking at the services market, which is measures in tens of trillions of dollars.
[00:36:05] And that's why the premiums that we're offering seems very high and seems at times ridiculous.
[00:36:14] **Molly:** Sorcery is proudly sponsored by CARDA. CARDA is transforming the private marketplace,

[00:36:58] R-C-E-R-Y. At what point are they reckless? 
[00:37:02] **Alfred Lin:** When you can't grow into that valuation over time,
[00:37:04] eventually what has to happen is the company is the discount of free cash flow. That's what it's
[00:37:14] built for. The security that you own is the net present value of all future discounted cash flows.
[00:37:19] And so you have to be able to justify the valuation that you're entering out and the
[00:37:27] multiples that you're paying for is very paid forward. So I think we're paying probably two or
[00:37:34] three or four years ahead of where most of these companies are. And it is the little reckless
[00:37:44] The other way to look at that, that's probably from the growth standpoint in the early stage business.
[00:37:51] The justification for higher and higher valuations is if a company is going to be worth a billion
[00:37:58] or 10 million dollars, whether I invested 10 million pre-money, 20 million, 30 million,
[00:38:05] 100 million, it really doesn't matter so long as I pick right.
[00:38:10] But if you double the valuation, that means you have half the number of shots
[00:38:16] that you can deploy, you just have to be twice as good. And so my push for the industry is,
[00:38:26] if you're going to write a check that is twice as large, then you need to have twice the collection.
[00:38:34] So that's the quantitative way that I sort of think about these things.
[00:38:39] And then the other, the other reason I think people feel good about the prices that they're paying
[00:38:47] is in the short run, they seem to be right, meaning they get marked up pretty quickly.
[00:38:55] But we all know that we won't know whether these companies make a knot for another decade.
[00:38:59] And I don't want to sound down. I'm very, very optimistic.
[00:39:07] And this is the only sort of line of business that I know where you meet two founders,
[00:39:15] a few founders, and they have an idea. And within a decade, they can build a company that's worth
[00:39:20] one billion to 10 billion dollars. We have many examples of that. In two decades, they can become
[00:39:26] 10 billion to 100 billion. Doordash and Airbnb being close to 100 billion. In three decades,
[00:39:32] they can be 100 billion to a trillion Apple, Google, Nvidia. And maybe in four decades,
[00:39:39] those companies will be worth 10 trillion dollars, not just one trillion.
[00:39:43] **Molly:** The company missed out on that is OpenAI. And how they got to a 500 billion dollar secondary
[00:39:50] valuation. How do you think about that one?
[00:39:54] **Alfred Lin:** Well, so it's easy to dismiss the 500 billion and say that you can't make money from 500 billion.
[00:39:59] But if we let in video, which is worth 4 trillion today, compound a 10% for another decade,
[00:40:05] it's going to be worth more than 10 trillion. So if OpenAI could be worth 5 trillion,
[00:40:10] then it would be a good investment from here. So the, as we talked about, this is such a fun
[00:40:18] and dynamic industry. And it's so fun to see these companies grow up. But the
[00:40:25] market sizes are just getting larger. The opportunity set is getting larger. It's really exciting.
[00:40:31] **Molly:** It's really exciting. It's fun. And you get to talk to all these founders too.
[00:40:35] I get to document it. 
[00:40:37] **Alfred Lin:** You get to document their successes and you can document
[00:40:41] their failures if they want to teach others on what they've learned from some of their failures.
[00:40:46] It's really fun. 
[00:40:47] **Molly:** Yeah, that was one of the reasons why I wanted to, I mean, why I wanted to go
[00:40:50] so hard with sorcery at least now. It's like, when are we going to get this historic
[00:40:54] of memorable stories and moments? It's crazy. Even the year previously, even with the coup.
[00:41:00] Like, that was wild. I wish I could have documented that one.
[00:41:05] **Alfred Lin:** We're going to look back very fondly because we always do very fondly on history. And thank you
[00:41:12] for documenting everything because we get to see it in the sort of raw elements of the building
[00:41:18] stages. 
[00:41:19] **Molly:** Well, as we think about looking forward, I want to know two things. One, what is your
[00:41:28] favorite calcium predictions market? 
[00:41:31] **Alfred Lin:** I can't pick among all the markets. I mean, it's a little
[00:41:35] unfair. I love economic indicators kind of a nerd that way. So I, you know,
[00:41:44] lots of people would think that's one of the sports markets, but no, I'm less of a sports fan
[00:41:49] more of an economics fan. 
[00:41:51] **Molly:** Yeah, I also like the alien one. It's always fun to ask people
[00:41:54] what their opinions are on aliens. Do you think we're going to learn if aliens exist this year?
[00:42:00] This year? 
[00:42:01] **Alfred Lin:** Yeah. Well, some people already believe that there we have proof that aliens exist.
[00:42:06] So I don't know how you resolve how you would resolve that.
[00:42:11] **Molly:** You need an article to determine. 
[00:42:13] **Alfred Lin:** I think that question depends on what's the
[00:42:16] article you use. 
[00:42:17] **Molly:** One of my favorite things is going to the calcium. One idea is
[00:42:22] and seeing what people actually say on their trades because you actually put your money
[00:42:26] where your mouth is and you see the trades in the ideas section. But then also nerd for me,
[00:42:32] I did a couple episodes on quantum and so I requested a quantum market. And in the quantum
[00:42:38] market, reading the fine print is just, it is extraordinary. The fine print is what determines
[00:42:45] whether something is yay or nay. It's a true, I guess it's like a true testament to consumer
[00:42:54] behavior. Most people are headline readers. 
[00:42:56] **Alfred Lin:** Well, I think we've conditioned ourselves to being
[00:43:01] not used to read text long form and now we read exposed and they're short. 
[00:43:07] **Molly:** Well, to close out,
[00:43:12] what are you most looking forward to in the next 12 months? 
[00:43:16] **Alfred Lin:** There's so many things that I look
[00:43:17] forward to. I think the, I think there's going to be a bit more stability into what we're building
[00:43:22] an AI and I think that's going to give a lot of opportunity for founders. And I most look forward
[00:43:29] to moving on from just pure automation and AI to reimagining consumer experiences. And I think
[00:43:39] a lot of things can be reimagined with AI that we have not done for a long period of time.
[00:43:45] We reimagined consumer experiences with the internet, we reimagined that with mobile,
[00:43:51] and I think there's going to be lots of innovation on consumer experiences in AI.
[00:43:58] **Molly:** Really exciting. Well, Alfred, it was a pleasure to have you on. 
[00:44:02] **Alfred Lin:** Thank you for having with us.
