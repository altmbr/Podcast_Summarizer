# Custom Commands

This directory contains custom slash commands for Claude Code.

To create a custom command:
1. Create a new `.md` file in this directory (e.g., `mycommand.md`)
2. Write the prompt/instructions you want Claude to execute
3. Use the command with `/mycommand` in Claude Code

Example: If you create `review.md` with content "Review this code for bugs", you can run `/review` to execute that prompt.
